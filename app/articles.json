[{"author": "Gary Boyd Roberts", "country": "", "title": "#88 Royal Descents, Notable Kin, and Printed Sources Additions to Ancestors of American Presidents, 2009 Edition", "content": "<p align=\"left\">This article will list major additions&#8212;usually those requiring new charts&#8212;to <i>Ancestors of American Presidents, 2009 Edition</i> [<i>AAP</i> 2009], 2012 reprint. Readers are invited to submit additions (or regrettably, and we hope only a few, corrections), and the list may also appear elsewhere on this website or <a href=\"http://www.notablekin.org/\">www.notablekin.org</a>, or in future issues of <i>American Ancestors</i>, as well as in future editions of <i>AAP</i>.&#160;<i></i></p>\r\n<p>1. Dorothy ____, wife of <b>John Plumb</b> of Wethersfield and Branford, Conn., and ancestor of F.D. Roosevelt (p. 550), was <b>Dorothy Chaplin</b>, sister of Mrs. Martha Chaplin Parke (p. 636), first wife (and first cousin) of Robert Parke of New London and Stonington, Conn., an ancestor of President Harding, First Ladies Ellen Wilson and Bess Truman (pp. 642-43), and the late Diana, Princess of Wales. Dorothy and Martha were daughters of William Chaplin (and Agnes Holborough), son by an unknown wife of William Chaplin, d. 1575-77/8, of Long Melford, Suffolk, these last parents also of Alice Chaplin, wife of an elder Robert Parke and mother of the above New London immigrant. See <i>TAG</i> 82 (2007): 250-61. The Chaplin-derived kinship between Harding and FDR is the first between these two presidents, so FDR now has 18 presidential kinsmen, equal to G.H.W. and G.W. Bush, and Harding has nine (pp. 591-93).</p>\r\n<p>2. Grant and F.D. Roosevelt ancestor <b>John Scudder</b> (p. 56 [#142], 455) was a son of Henry Scudder, d. 1594-95, of Horton Kirby, Kent, and Elizabeth ____. An almost certain granddaughter of this couple was the immigrant Bridget ____ of Salem, Mass., wife of Thomas Verry and Edward Giles and mother of Eleazer Giles (p. 95), Taft ancestor #228. The resulting kinship between Grant and Taft would also be their first. Taft would then have 17 presidential kinsmen, and Grant eight. See <i>TAG</i> 72 (1997): 285-300.</p>\r\n<p>3. Grant and F.D. Roosevelt ancestor <b>Elizabeth (Stoughton) Scudder</b> (pp. 56 [#143], 455) was a daughter of Rev. Thomas Stoughton, b. ca. 1555, vicar of Naughton, Suffolk, and Coggeshall, Essex, and his first wife, Katherine ____. Elizabeth&#8217;s brother was Israel Stoughton (1602/3-1644), militia officer and founder of Dorchester, Mass., who married Elizabeth Knight, maternal aunt of Yale College benefactor Elihu Yale, and left (in addition to William Stoughton, chief justice of Mass. during the Salem witchcraft trials) a daughter, Rebecca Stoughton, who married William Tailer. Elizabeth (Tailer) Nelson, daughter of these last, was FDR ancestor #175, p. 124. See <i>TAG</i> 72 (1997): 295-97, 29 (1953): 193-204, 33 (1957): 105-12 and the Nelson work by Temple Prime cited on p. 263. And for Exhurst, Roberts, likely Colepepper and Roper, and possible Lewknor and <i>RD</i> ancestry of the Stoughtons see <i>NEHGR</i> 165 (2011): 245-60, 166 (2012): 46-70.</p>\r\n<p>4. Taft ancestor <b>William Eure, 1<sup>st</sup> Baron Eure</b>, p. 429, was a son of Sir Ralph Eure (and Muriel Hastings), son of Sir William Eure (and Margaret Constable), son of Sir Ralph Eure and Elizabeth Greystock, daughter of John Greystock, 4<sup>th</sup> Baron Greystock, and Elizabeth Ferrers, daughter of Robert Ferrers, 2<sup>nd</sup> Baron Boteler of Wemme, and Lady Joan Beaufort (pp. 648-49). Thus Taft is a tenth presidential descendant of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and a fifteenth presidential kinsman of modern royalty. See <i>P1 A</i>, pp. 296-98, (Eure, Mansfield), 363 (Greystoke/Greystock), 134-35 (Ferrers), 75-77 (Beaufort). This line was brought to my attention by Martin E. Hollick.</p>\r\n<p>5. Douglas Richardson reports that Clifford L. Stott has disproved the royal descent of <b>Thomas</b><b>Newberry</b> of Mass., which in its specifics was also doubted by Sir Anthony Richard Wagner. Thus the top section of pp. 333 and 335, plus all of p. 334, should be deleted, as should the listing for Thomas Newberry among the <i>RD</i> ancestors of Hayes (p. 264) and Ford (p. 274), and the bolded notice of the Thomas Newberry line for Ford on p. 376.</p>\r\n<p>6. C.A. Torrey, in his Taft ancestor list in <i>TAG</i> 22 (1944-45):205, misidentified the parents of <b>Jacob Aldrich [Jr.]</b>, #222, p. 92. Jacob was not the son of John and Sarah Thompson, but of John&#8217;s brother Jacob Aldrich and Huldah Thayer, daughter of Ferdinando Thayer and Huldah Hayward; see p. 495. Taft is thus a fourth president (in addition to Coolidge, Ford, and G.W. Bush) of Thayer (Tayer) descent. See Alvin James Aldrich, <i>The George Aldrich Genealogy</i>, vol. 1 (1971), pp. 38-40, 44-45 and the pertinent Braintree and Mendon vital records, and Waldo Chamberlain Sprague, &#8220;Thomas Thayer Genealogy,&#8221; mss. at NEHGS, card for Ferdinando<sup>2</sup> Thayer. Alexander Bannerman brought this new Thayer line to my attention.</p>\r\n<p>7. Nixon ancestor #377, <b>Mary (Hartshorne) Clayton</b>, was a daughter of Richard Hartshorn(e) and Margaret Carr, sister of Harding ancestor Caleb Carr (pp. 346, 491, 582) and daughter of Robert Carr, d. 1681, Newport, R.I., &amp; _____. See Derick S. Hartshorn III, <i>The Hartshorne Families in America</i> (1997), pp. 501-6 and R.C. Anderson, G.F. Sanborn Jr., and M.L. Sanborn, <i>The Great Migration: Immigrants to New England, 1634-1635</i>, vol. 2 (2001), pp. 24-27 (Robert Carr).</p>\r\n<p>8.<b> Peter Lester, Jr.</b> (ca. 1697-ca. 1741), Hoover ancestor #182, p. 115, was a son of Peter Lester (ca. 1660-1742, a Quaker immigrant from Leicestershire, England, to Richland, Penn.), and Martha Duncalf, who are Nixon ancestors #474-75, p. 154. Peter and Martha are the first Pennsylvania couple, and only the second Quaker couple (the first was Richard and Abigail [____] Lippincott, p. 561) shown to be ancestors of two presidents. When added to the various New York and two Maryland (Cheney and Duvall) families, mid-Atlantic representation among the 203 whose progeny includes two or more presidents, rises to 18, still less than 10%.</p>\r\n<p>9. In <i>PlA</i> 2: 2: 278-85 Douglas Richardson developed a royal descent for <b>Edward Howell</b> of Southampton, L.I. (m. Frances Paxton and Eleanor ____), an ancestor of Mrs. Julia Gardiner Tyler as follows: Julia (Gardiner) Tyler; David Gardiner &amp; Juliana Maclachlan; Abraham Gardiner, Jr. &amp; Phebe Dayton; Abraham Gardiner &amp; Mary Smith; Nathaniel Smith &amp; Phebe Howell; Josiah Howell &amp; Mary Johnes; Richard Howell &amp; Elizabeth Halsey; <i>Edward Howell</i> (<i>RD</i>) of L.I. &amp; Frances Paxton. See F.K. Smith, <i>The Family of Richard Smith of Smithtown, Long Island</i> (1967), pp. 63-65, 125-29 (to Mrs. Tyler) and E.H. Rose and David Faris, <i>Descendants of Edward Howell (1584-1655) of&#8230;Southampton, Long Island, New York</i> (1985), pp. 5-38, 47-48, 75-76, 116.</p>\r\n<p>10.<b> Caroline Watts Haskell</b>, wife of George Cabot Lee and mother of Alice Hathaway (Lee) Roosevelt, first wife of the 26<sup>th</sup> president (see pp. 351, 354, 402-3) was of royal descent via Mrs. Audrey Barlow Almy and a descendant also of <i>Mayflower</i> passengers Francis Cooke, Richard Warren, John and Elizabeth (Tilley) Howland, and John and Joan (Hurst) (Rogers) Tilley. These descents may be outlined thus: Caroline Watts Haskell; Elisha Haskell &amp; Alice Russell Hathaway; Eli Haskell &amp; Achsah Nye, Humphrey Hathaway &amp; Abigail Smith; Ebenezer Nye &amp; Melatiah Sturgis, Stephen Hathaway, Jr. &amp; Lydia Swain; Caleb Nye &amp; Hannah Bodfish, Stephen Hathaway &amp; Abigail Smith; Benjamin Bodfish &amp; Lydia Crocker, Jethro Hathaway &amp; Hannah West; Jonathan Crocker &amp; Hannah Howland, Thomas Hathaway &amp; Hepzibah Starbuck, Stephen West, Jr. &amp; Susanna Jenney; John Howland, Jr. &amp; Mary Lee, Arthur Hathaway, Jr. &amp; Sarah Cooke, Stephen West &amp; Mercy Cooke; <i>John Howland</i> (<i>MP</i>) &amp; <i>Elizabeth Tilley</i> (<i>MP</i>), John Cooke &amp; Sarah Warren (parents of Sarah and Mercy), Bartholomew West &amp; Katherine Almy; <i>John Tilley</i> (<i>MP</i>) &amp; <i>Joan Hurst </i>(<i>MP</i>), <i>Francis Cooke</i> (<i>MP</i>) &amp; Hester le Mahieu, <i>Richard Warren</i> (<i>MP</i>) &amp; Elizabeth Walker, William <i>Almy</i> &amp; <i>Audrey Barlow</i> (<i>RD</i>). See E.P. White, <i>John Howland of the Mayflower: Volume 2&#8230;John<sup>2</sup> Howland</i> (1993), pp. 1-22, 33-34, 81-82, 187-89 (to Ebenezer Nye), <i>MF</i> 12: 1-28, 37-46, 75-76, 81-82, 121-23, 147-48, 319-20 (and <i>MF</i> 18: 1: 1-2, 5-6 (Cooke and Warren to Stephen Hathaway), L.B.

Sanborn, <i>The Great Migration: Immigrants to New England, 1634-35</i>, vol. 1 (1999), pp. 42-47 (Almy).</p>\r\n<p>11. On the back of a non-genealogical item dated 2 Sept. 1945, now in the Tryon mss. file at the Connecticut Historical Society, Donald Lines Jacobus drew a chart of the Tryon family that gives Sarah Tryon (b. Glastonbury, Conn. 13 July 1730), a great-great-grandmother of <b>Mrs. Helen Herron Taft</b>, as having married (1) in 1755 Benjamin Smith and (2) 1758 Lawrence Clinton. In <i>TAG</i> 83 (2008-9): 81-100, in a three-generation study of the progeny of William Tryon, Gale Ion Harris shows that probably the Sarah Tryon, wife of Lawrence Clinton, could be only Sarah, b. 1730, daughter of Joseph Tryon (1702-71) and Sarah Treat (b. 1707). In <i>The Connecticut Nutmegger</i> 44 (2011-12): 267-68, 271, Lynn B. McManus also identifies the Sarah, b. 1730, as Clinton&#8217;s second wife (and cites the chart by Jacobus), as had Joan Parsons Wang (niece of the sociologist Talcott Parsons) in <i>Captain Jotham Parsons (1783-1860): A Genealogical Biography</i> (2001), chart on p. 457. These recent works and the 1945 chart supersede Jacobus&#8217;s description of Mrs. Sarah Tryal in <i>FANH</i>, p. 424, and his lack of a marital history for Sarah, b. 1730, in <i>The Bulkeley Genealogy</i> (1933), pp. 164-65. Sarah&#8217;s death record (9 Dec. 1794, aged 66) clearly, as was common, overestimates her age. </p>\r\n<p>Sarah (Treat) Tryon was a great-granddaughter of three <i>RD</i> immigrants, as follows: Thomas Treat &amp; Dorothy Bulkeley; Rev. Gershom Bulkeley &amp; Sarah Chauncey; <i>Rev. Peter</i><i> Bulkeley</i> (<i>AAP</i>, pp. 253-55) &amp; <i>Grace Chetwode</i> (<i>RD</i>), <i>Rev. Charles Chauncey</i>, second president of Harvard College (<i>RD</i>) &amp; Catherine Eyre. See <i>Bulkeley</i>, as above, pp. 92-111, 116-27, 137, 164-65, and W.C. Fowler, <i>Memorials of the Chaunceys </i>(1858), pp. 1-45, 232-35.</p>\r\n<p>12. Alexander Bannerman, formerly James K. Raywalt, in <i>Executive Papers: A Publication of the Hereditary Order of the Families of the Presidents and First Ladies of America</i>, issue 8 (Autumn 2011), p. 14-19, 25, 71-72, has traced two new descents from <i>RD</i> immigrants for <b>Mrs. Ellen Louise Axson Wilson</b>, one an addition to <i>RD600</i> with new immigrant sisters. Mrs. Wilson&#8217;s maternal grandfather, Rev. Nathan Hoyt, Jr., was the son of Nathan Hoyt and Meribah Perkins, daughter of Abraham Perkins of Ipswich, Mass., and Sanbornton, N.H. (and Mary Sanborn), son of Matthew Perkins, Jr. (and Mary Brewer), son of Matthew Perkins and Esther Burnham, daughter of Thomas <i>Burnham</i> and <i>Mary Lawrence</i> of Mass., <i>RD</i>. Via Mary Lawrence&#8217;s sister <i>Jane (Lawrence) Giddings</i> of Mass. and their brother <i>Thomas Lawrence</i> of Long Island, Mrs. Wilson is a cousin of Taft and FDR. See <i>DG1</i>, pp. 129-30, 401 (Lawrence, Burnham), G.A. Perkins, <i>The Family of John Perkins of Ipswich, Massachusetts, Part Third, Descendants of Sergeant Jacob Perkins</i> (1889), pp. 11-12, 16-17, 26-27, 53-54 and David W. Hoyt, <i>A Genealogical History of the Hoyt, Haight and Hight Families</i> (1871, repr. 1984), pp. 73, 99, 66.</p>\r\n<p>Mrs. Wilson&#8217;s paternal grandfather, Isaac Stockton Keith Axson, was the son of Samuel Edward Axson and Sarah Anne Palmer, daughter of Job Palmer and Sarah Morgan, daughter of Nathaniel <i>Morgan</i> and <i>Anna Tucker</i> of S.C., <i>RD</i>, daughter of Benjamin S[towe] Tucker (and Love [Gibbs?]), son of William Tucker (and Ann Stowe), son of George Tucker of Bermuda and Frances St. George, for whom see <i>RD600</i>, pp. 263-66 and Robert Dennard Tucker, <i>Descendants of William Tucker of Trowleigh, Devon</i> (1991), esp. pp. 52, 184-85, 187 (also for Anna&#8217;s sisters&#8212;Sarah Tucker, wife of William Harris and Edward Bullard [by Harris, she left locally notable Southern descendants] and Mary, who married John Ballentine/Ballantine, all of S.C.). Daughter Anna Morgan and son-in-law Nathaniel morgan, and their residence in South Carolina, were mentioned in the 1759 will of Benjamin S[towe] Tucker (see <i>Tucker</i>, p. 187). Anna Tucker&#8217;s 1807 will (Charleston, S.C. will book 31 at p. 16) names son-in-law Job Palmer (who married Morgan sisters) and &#8220;the children of my deceased daughter Sarah&#8221; and the death notice of Mrs. Sarah A. Axson (see Brent H. Holcomb, <i>Marriages and Deaths from the Charlesto<u>w</u>n Observer, 1827-1845</i> [1981], issue of 25 Feb. 1837) calls her a daughter of Job Palmer. See also Thomas Cary Johnson, <i>The Life and Letters of Benjamin Morgan Palmer</i> (1906) and <i>NEHGR</i> 95 (1941): 203-4, 112 (1958): 263-65. Mrs. Ellen L.A. Wilson now has five <i>RD</i> immigrant ancestors but, as noted above, loses the possibility of such a line from Thomas Newberry of Mass.</p>\r\n<p>13. Alexander Bannerman also found (<i>Executive Papers</i>, issue 8, as above, pp. 29-39, 72, esp. 37-39) a seventh <i>RD</i> ancestor for <b>Mrs. Edith Bolling Galt Wilson</b>. Anne Stanard, wife of William Walter (<i>AAP</i>, 2009, p. 399) was a daughter of William Stanard, Jr. (and Anne Hazlewood), son of William Stanard and Mrs. Eltonhead Conway Thacker (an ancestor by Henry Thacker, her first husband, of President Obama; see <i>AAP</i> 2009, pp. 313, 569), daughter of Edwin Conway and Martha Eltonhead of Virginia, <i>RD</i>. Among other sources Alex cites <i>HVG</i>, p. 279, and <i>GVFVM</i> 1:98-100 (Conway, Stanard, Thacker). Via Conway Mrs. Edith B.G. Wilson is a seventh cousin four times removed, of the half blood, of President Obama and a third cousin five times removed of President James Madison.</p>\r\n<p>14. <b>First Lady Florence Mabel Kling DeWolfe Harding</b> was a descendant of Henry Gregory of Conn., almost certainly of royal descent, as follows: Amos H. Kling &amp; Louisa Emily Bouton; Harvey Bouton &amp; Dorcas Emily Hanford; John Bouton &amp; Rhoda Richards; Ezra Bouton &amp; Mary Bouton; Jachin Bouton &amp; Mary ____ (parents of Mary); Joseph Bouton &amp; Mary Gregory; Jachin Gregory &amp; Mary ____; John Gregory &amp; Sarah ____; <i>Henry Gregory</i> &amp; ____. See James Boughton, <i>Bouton-Boughton Family</i> (1890), pp. 9, 15, 129-30, 140-42, and Grant Gregory, <i>Ancestors and Descendants of Henry Gregory</i> (1938), pp. 34-51, 55-56. See also Donald Lines Jacobus, <i>History and Genealogy of the Families of Old Fairfield</i>, vol. 1 (1930, repr. 1976), pp. 97 (Bouton), pp. 236-38 (Gregory). This line was also brought to my attention by Alexander Bannerman.</p>\r\n<p>15. <b>First Lady Grace Anna Goodhue Coolidge</b> was a descendant, as again traced by Alexander Bannerman, of Richard Warren of the <i>Mayflower</i>, as follows: Andrew Issachar Goodhue &amp; Lemira A. Barrett; Towns Barrett &amp; Laurena Fretts; Henry Fretts &amp; Joanna Barnes; Reuben Barnes &amp; Eleanor Shipley; Joseph Barnes &amp; Joanna Sprague; Jeremiah Sprague &amp; Priscilla Knight, Anthony Sprague &amp; Elizabeth Bartlett; Robert Bartlett &amp; Mary Warren, <i>Richard Warren</i> (<i>MP</i>) &amp; Elizabeth Walker. See <i>MF</i> 18: 1: 1-4, 16-17, 67, 2 (2<sup>nd</sup> ed., 2011): 97 (to Mrs. Joanna Sprague Barnes); D.H. Heard<i>, History of Hillsborough County, New Hampshire</i> (1885), p. 542 (Reuben Barnes [as son of Joseph], Mrs. Joanna Barnes Fretts and Lorena [Laurena, etc.] Fretts), plus <i>The History of Merrimack, New Hampshire</i>, vol. 1 (1996), pp. 198-99, 243 (Barnes, Fretts); N.H. marriage record of Towns Barrett and &#8220;Loreni&#8221; Fretts (24 Dec. 1846) and 1850 N.H. census, p. 412 (for Nashville, N.H., later Nashua), lines 8-12, for Towns Barrett, 30 Laurena, 30, Lenura [Lemira], 2, Henry R., 1/12, and Lydia [Towns] Barrett, 65); tombstones of Andrew Issachar Goodhue and Lemira Barrett Goodhue, 26 April 1849-24 October 1929 in Greenmount Cemetery, Burlington, Vermont, and W.W. Hayward, <i>The History of Hancock, New Hampshire</i> (1889), p. 606 (Goodhue).</p>\r\n<p>16.<b> First Lady Lou Henry Hoover</b> was of likely royal descent via Mrs. <b>Elizabeth Bullock Clement(s)</b>, an ancestor of G.H.W. and G.W. Bush. Bush forebears Hannah Sumner (granddaughter of Mrs. Clements) and John Goffe (p. 383) were also grandparents of Lou Henry ancestor John Goffe (III) (p. 626), husband of Hannah Griggs and son of John Goffe, Jr. and Hannah Parish (three John Goffes had wives named Hannah). See <i>NK1</i> (first in <i>NEXUS</i> 8 [1991]: 29, 31), pp. 21, 25 and, among sources cited therein, correspondence with the Hoover Presidential Library, the DAR application of Mrs. Jean Henry Large (Mrs. Hoover&#8217;s sister) and P.P. Woodbury, Thomas Savage and William Patten, <i>History of Bedford, New Hampshire, from 1737 </i>(1903), pp. 932-33 (Goffe), 1110 (Wallace). Note also Rev. W.R. Cochrane, <i>History of the Town of Antrim, New Hampshire</i> (1880), pp. 733-34 (Wallace) and <i>History of Butler and Bremer Counties, Iowa</i> (1883), pp. 354-55 (Dr. John Scobey), 700 (Phineas Weed). </p>\r\n<p>17. John C. Brandon of Columbia, S.C. has charted and brought to my attention the <b>Brin(d)ley</b> ancestry shared by Mrs. Garfield, FDR, and the late Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Lawrence Brin(dl)ley of Willnall, Staffordshire, was the father, by ____ Fle(t)cher, of William Brin(d)ley of Willnall, who married Anne Tunkes and was the father of Alice Brin(d)ley, wife of Richard Foley, and of Richard Brin(d)ley of Exeter, who married Joan Reese and was the father of Thomas Brin(d)ley of Datchett, Bucks (d. 1661), an &#8220;auditor of the Revenue of King Charles the First and King Charles the Second.&#8221; Thomas married Anne Wase and was the father of Francis Brinley of Newport, R.I.; <i>Grizzell Brinley</i> of Shelter Island, N.Y., wife of Nathaniel Sylvester; and <i>Anne Brinley</i> of R.I., wife of Governor William Coddington. Grizzell Sylvester, daughter of Nathaniel and Grizzell, married James Lloyd of Lloyds Neck, L.I., and is FDR ancestor #173. Mary Coddington, daughter of Governor William and Anne, married Peleg Sanford, also a governor of R.I., and is an ancestor of Mrs. Lucretia Rudolph Garfield (see p. 366). The younger William Brin(d)ley is listed in Gerald Paget, <i>The Lineage and Ancestry of H.R.H. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales</i>, vol. 2 (1977), p. 88, as the Prince&#8217;s ancestor #M7251. Richard Foley and Anne Brin(d)ley were the parents of Thomas Foley, father (by Anne Browne) of another Thomas Foley, father (by Elizabeth Ashe) of Elizabeth Foley, wife of Robert Harley, 1<sup>st</sup> Earl of Oxford, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Speaker of the House of Commons. Edward Harley, 2<sup>nd</sup> Earl of Oxford, a son of these last, married Lady Harriett Cavendish Holles and was the father of Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley, wife of William Bentinck, 2<sup>nd</sup> Duke of Portland, and mother of William Henry Bentinck, 3<sup>rd</sup> Duke of Portland, British Prime Minister. This last, by Lady Dorothy Cavendish, was the father of Lord William Charles Augustus Cavendish-Bentinck, father by Anne Wellesley of Charles William Cavendish-Bentinck, father by Caroline Louisa Burnaby of Nina Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck, pp. 623, 625 herein, wife of Claude George Bowes-Lyon, 14<sup>th</sup> Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne and mother of H.M. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. See <i>GGE</i>, pp. 13-19 (Brinley), W.C. Metcalfe, ed., <i>The Visitation of the County of Worcester, 1682-83</i> (1883), pp. 46-47 (Foley), Charles P. Noyes, <i>Noyes-Gilman Ancestry</i> (1907), pp. 66-73 (Brinley, Coddington), Rev. Jacob E. Tallman, <i>Historical Papers on Shelter Island</i> (1899, repr. 1985), p. 177 (Sylvester) and the Lloyds of Queens Village, Lloyds Neck citation on pp. 262-63 herein.</p>\r\n<p>Also of note among the late Queen Mother&#8217;s presidential kin are the Harrisons, via <b>Bernard of Abington</b> (see <i>AAP 2009</i>, pp. 320-21 and <i>RD600</i> [2008], pp. 289-90, 576-77, 858). President W.H. Harrison was almost certainly a sixth cousin of Mildred (Porteus) Hodgson, and President Benjamin Harrison was an eighth cousin of the late Henrietta Maria (Hodgson) Smith, this last a great-grandmother of the Queen Mother. And James Madison ancestor <b>Thomas Gerard</b> (see p. 313), husband of Maud Bold, was a son of William Gerard of Ince, Lancashire, and Elizabeth Byron, listed in Paget, as above, p. 468, Prince Charles ancestors Q120217-8. Gilbert Gerard, another son of these last and brother of Thomas, was the father by Eleanor Davison of Sir William Gerard (d. 1581), father by Dorothy Barton of Sydney Gerard, wife of Sir John Wynne, 1<sup>st</sup> Bt., and mother of Mary Wynne, wife of Sir Roger Mostyn.&#160; Sir Thomas Mostyn, a son of these last, married Elizabeth Whitlock and was the father of Sir Roger Mostyn, 1<sup>st</sup> Bt., father by Prudence Lumley of Jane Mostyn, wife of Sir John Trevor and mother of Anne Trevor, wife of Michael Hill. Arthur Hill, later Trevor, 1<sup>st</sup> Viscount Dungannon, son of these last and an eighth cousin of President Madison, married Anne Stafford and was the father of Anne Trevor, wife of Garret Wellesley, 1<sup>st</sup> Earl of Mornington, and mother of Arthur Wellesley, 1<sup>st</sup> Duke of Wellington, the victor of Waterloo, and Richard Wellesley, 1<sup>st</sup> Marquess Wellesley, governor-general of India. Anne Wellesley, an illegitimate daughter of this last by Hyacinthe Gabriel (Fagan) Roland, married secondly Lord William Charles Augustus Cavendish-Bentinck, see above, and was a great-grandmother of the Queen Mother.</p>\r\n<p>18. Anson J. Thurston, Jr. of Ojai, California, has noted that <b>Mary Dane</b> (p. 527), wife of William Chandler and mother of Hannah (Chandler) Robbins, FDR ancestor #241, was a daughter of John and Eleanor (Clark) Dane, the former a brother of Elizabeth Dane, wife of James How(e) and mother of James How(e), Jr. This last was the husband of Salem witchcraft victim Mrs. Elizabeth Jackson How(e), listed in <i>NK2</i>, p. 82. Mrs. How(e) is the fifth such victim with presidential connections, following Mrs. Susanna North Martin and John Proctor, Jr. (Arthur), George Jacobs (Taft), and Mrs. Mary Ayer Parker (Ford). See <i>Noyes-Gilman Ancestry</i>, as above (12), pp. 289-96 (Chandler, Dane) and G.B. Howe, <i>Howe Genealogies</i>, vol. 2 (1929), pp. 153-59, 158-59, 162, 169, 8, 14-15.</p>\r\n<p>For one descent of First Lady Mrs. Grace Anna Goodhue Coolidge from Edmund Towne, brother of witchcraft victims Mrs. Mary Towne Estey and Mrs. Rebecca Towne Nurse, see <i>NK2</i>, pp. 79-86; also outlined therein is the Mary (Towne) Estey descent of Mrs. (Virginia) Joan Bennett Kennedy, first wife of U.S. Senator and liberal leader Edward Moore Kennedy, and thus a sister-in-law of 35<sup>th</sup> President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. In Mrs. Coolidge&#8217;s Edmund Towne descent, Benjamin Knight, Jr., married a first cousin; Benjamin was a son of Jonathan Knight and Phebe Perkins, sister of Sarah (Perkins) Lake.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, through her mother, Lemira A. Barrett, Mrs. Coolidge has two more Towne lines, as follows: Lemira A.

This assigns Sibling numbers continuously through all ancestral Pairings, using numbers representing temporal or other rankings appended to the calculated Line and Generation numbers of each direct Line.&#160; This fundamental alternative is particularly satisfactory for presenting any pedigree of direct ancestors and their full Siblings. However, by numbering all offspring consecutively, it excludes visibly identifying half-Siblings as being from collateral, non-ancestral Pairings.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>To fully account for Sibling relationships, there is the option first to number all the Pairings of each direct ancestor and thereafter number all offspring as Siblings within their Pairing.&#160; With this alternative, a four-number format assigns a number for each Pairing by Line and Generation in the entire collateral family, and then assigns a number for each Sibling within their nuclear family.&#160; This extended approach most clearly identifies different Pairings as well as the half-Siblings of collateral Pairings, of which there may be several in any Generation, both paternal and maternal.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><i>Ancestral Lines</i> readily supports both the Y-DNA and mtDNA studies often paired with traditional family research.&#160; These two distinct ancestral lineages are prominent and easily followed in the new system.&#160; Patrilineal Line 1 conveniently always represents the Y-DNA line, and <i>Ancestral Lines&#8217;</i> straightforward Generational numbering matches with the testing companies&#8217; and others&#8217; supporting software formats that indicate the probabilities of when a Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) is shared.</p>\r\n<p><i>Ancestral Lines</i> is mathematically based and readily computerized.&#160; Numbers given to the Maternal Lines paired in each Generation are equal to the partner&#8217;s Paternal Line number plus a consistent &#8220;Generation Constant.&#8221;&#160; This added number increases for all Lines in each ancestral Generation, growing as should be expected as multiples (or powers) of the &#8220;coupling&#8221; number, two.</p>\r\n<p align=\"left\">&#160;</p>\r\n<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>\r\n<p align=\"left\">When working with ancestral lineages, both professional and non-professional genealogists most often deal with family &#8220;lines&#8221; and &#8220;generations.&#8221;&#160; However, there is no accepted ancestral numbering system that addresses this apparent need to reliably assign and clearly indicate both lineage and generational information.<sup> [<a name=\"_ednref1\" href=\"#_edn1\">1</a>], [<a name=\"_ednref2\" href=\"#_edn2\">2</a>], [<a name=\"_ednref3\" href=\"#_edn3\">3</a>]&#160; &#160;</sup>This is particularly concerning, since it has been acknowledged for decades that the &#8220;selection of a numbering system is one of the key decisions the writer of a family history will have to make.&#160; It should, therefore, be made with care.&#8221;<sup>[<a name=\"_ednref4\" href=\"#_edn4\">4</a>], [<a name=\"_ednref5\" href=\"#_edn5\">5</a>]</sup></p>\r\n<p>The widely-used Ahnentafel method of sequentially numbering individuals in ancestral pedigrees does not directly indicate antecedent lines or generations.<sup>[<a name=\"_ednref6\" href=\"#_edn6\">6</a>]</sup>&#160; This also is the case for the Dollarhide and similar approaches, most derived from the Ahnentafel indexing method.<sup>[<a name=\"_ednref7\" href=\"#_edn7\">7</a>]</sup>&#160; Until now, there has been no generally accepted mathematically-based alternative to Ahnentafel numbering.<sup>[<a name=\"_ednref8\" href=\"#_edn8\">8</a>]</sup></p>\r\n<p>In many endeavors, specific precursors, \"lines of reasoning\" or \"sequences of information\" give rise to the need to uniquely identify all contributors and how each is correlated with another in a primary, secondary or more distant relationship.&#160; In all cases, maintaining the integrity of the relevant \"lines\" or \"sequences\" is paramount, and recording the relationships to indicate succinctly as much useful information as possible is always important and usually the basis of any systematic approach to record keeping.</p>\r\n<p>An improved ancestral numbering system is needed that, at a minimum, displays component lines and generations. Any such new system must meet the more general requirements of being easy to read and understand, and of recording relationships briefly with as much useful information as possible, while maintaining the integrity of its indicators.&#160; To complete this undertaking, the new system also should provide options to informatively record the entire collateral family, uniquely assigning individual numbers for ancestral pairings and siblings comprising each nuclear family.</p>\r\n<p>An &#8220;Ancestral Lines Pairing System&#8221; therefore has been developed for uniquely numbering each ancestral line, generation, pairing and sibling in any genealogical record.&#160; Called <i>Ancestral Lines</i> for short, it was developed by the author, Capers W. McDonald, beginning in 1984, with expansion and descriptive updates since.<sup>[<a name=\"_ednref9\" href=\"#_edn9\">9</a>]</sup></p>\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<h3>A NEW ANCESTRAL NUMBERING SYSTEM</h3>\r\n<p>&#160;The Ancestral Lines Pairing System is an antecedent pairs numbering system that is designed to consistently calculate and clearly display both lineage and generational information reliably and succinctly.&#160; It also enables users to account for all members of each nuclear family, including all pairings and the siblings or half-siblings of collateral partners.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Most generally, <i>Ancestral Lines</i> is a method for representing genealogical information in a mathematical array by ordering and numbering direct ancestors and their siblings.&#160; This information can be presented coherently in text or book formats as well as in tabular or other diagrammatic forms.</p>\r\n<p>With <i>Ancestral Lines</i>, ancestors are individually numbered without first compiling a comprehensive set or definitively naming all individuals, requiring only connecting how each relates to a selected descendant or another known ancestor.&#160; Complex relationships among ancestors &#8211; such as generation intervals for Y-DNA analyses; maternal line tracing with mtDNA implications; how generations in different lines share time periods; or clear indications of generations and pairing order for half-siblings &#8211; readily are ascertained based on this numbering.</p>\r\n<p>Two types of numerical records constitute <i>Ancestral Lines</i>.&#160; First, relationships are calculated for all direct ancestral Lines and Generations, and then individuals can be assigned numbers relative to their Pairings and Siblings.</p>\r\n<p>Figure One shows an example of a pedigree chart of four generations in a well-known early American family<sup>[<a name=\"_ednref10\" href=\"#_edn10\">10</a>]</sup> using <i>Ancestral Lines</i> numbering.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Ancestral Figure 1\" alt=\"Ancestral Figure 1\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Massachusetts/ancestral_figure_01.jpg\">&#160;&#160;</p>\r\n<p>The initial Line and Generation numbering relationships for <i>Ancestral Lines</i> are shown in Figure Two.&#160; The inherent symmetry of the newly numbered Lines appearing in each Generation is shaded, to emphasize how both the relative positions or &#8220;branching&#8221; of these, as well as the sequence of Generations along each Line, are systematically organized to provide the most useful information in a basic format. </p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Ancestral Figure 2\" alt=\"Ancestral Figure 2\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Massachusetts/ancestral_figure_02.jpg\"></p>\r\n<h3 align=\"left\">SIBLING ASSIGNMENTS IN A THREE-NUMBER FORMAT</h3>\r\n<p>A three-number format of <i>Ancestral Lines</i> assigns Sibling numbers continuously through all ancestral Pairings.&#160; In this approach, a number representing temporal or other ranking based on birth date or other information for each Sibling is appended to the first two, calculated Line and Generation numbers of each Paternal Line.&#160; For example, as shown in Figure Three, the first and second Siblings born in direct Paternal Line 7 in Generation 4 for another well-studied early American family<sup>[<a name=\"_ednref11\" href=\"#_edn11\">11</a>]</sup> would be numbered 7.4:1 and 7.4:2, respectively.&#160; This fundamental, three-number format is particularly satisfactory for presenting any ancestral pedigree of direct ancestors and their full siblings, but excludes visibly identifying half-siblings as being from collateral pairings.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The extended, four-number format of <i>Ancestral Lines</i> assigns numbers for both Pairings and Siblings, thereby providing the inherently valuable indication of different marriages or other Pairings, as well as clearly identifying half-siblings of collateral partners.&#160; For additional insights into all of these numbering relationships, please see the Portable Document Format (PDF) version of this article.</p>\r\n<p><img title=\"Ancestral Figure 3\" alt=\"Ancestral Figure 3\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Massachusetts/ancestral_figure_03.jpg\">&#160;&#160;</p>\r\n<h3>ORGANIZATION OF ANCESTRAL LINEAGES</h3>\r\n<p>By design, <i>Ancestral Lines</i> organizes and numbers each direct line in a manner ideally suited to presenting these as continuous family lineages.&#160; For example, the first 16 of these lines comprise a compelling start to almost any ancestral pedigree.&#160; Completing these through their inherent first four generations of ancestry could be an initial goal for many researchers &#8211; one that might take years to reach or, for some, be found to be unreachable.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>For better-known ancestries, with perhaps centuries of development behind them, the initial 16 lines still could serve as the beginning of a much longer and broader genealogical journey.&#160; One presentation, for example, would be a variation of the &#8220;multi-surname approach&#8221; described by Curran for the &#8220;writer who chooses to group his ancestral lines by surname, presenting them one at a time&#8230;&#8221;<sup>[<a name=\"_ednref12\" href=\"#_edn12\">12</a>]</sup> Alternatively, after presenting these first 16 as deep lineage chapters, the genealogist could group all other lines first appearing in the earlier cohorts by generation, similar to a traditional Ahnentafel, but with considerably easier reference to the relationships of the first numbered lineages as well as to other lines and each numbered generation.&#160; Several other presentation formats also are possible.</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"View an expanded version of this article as a PDF document\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedFiles/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Other_Articles/ancestral_lines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">View an expanded version of this article as a PDF document</a>.</p>\r\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n<p>Ancestral Lines is currently conducting a very brief, secure online survey about professional and non-professional work with ancestral lineages.

Woodward, Connecticut state historian and associate professor of history at the University of Connecticut, entitled, &#8220;John Winthrop, Jr. and the Alchemy of Colonial Settlement.&#8221; The <a title=\"TWG 555_AAmarticle.html.pdf\" href=\"http://web1.americanancestors.org/uploadedFiles/American_Ancestors/Content/Blogs/eNews/TWG%20555_AAmarticle.html.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>, based on his 2010 book, <em>Prospero&#8217;s America: John Winthrop, Jr., Alchemy and the Creation of New England Culture, 1606&#8211;1676</em>, began with a description of how Woodward found his topic: &#8220;Years ago, as a beginning graduate student, I took a wrong turn while trying to find the living history museum at Old Sturbridge Village, Massachusetts. I soon was hopelessly lost, and ended up parking on a winding, climbing road by a rusty old historical marker, south (I later found out) of my destination. The marker, barely readable, told me I was at the site where John Winthrop, Jr. had started a &#8220;black lead&#8221; mine in 1644. 1644? Mining? In the middle of the wilderness?&#8221; Woodward went on to spend years of research answering the questions posed by that historical marker.</p>\r\n<div title=\"Content\" id=\"Content\" name=\"Content\"><p>In my role as editor of <em>American Ancestors</em>, I was responsible for illustrating the article, and I was determined to find an image of the sign. I had been vaguely aware of uniform historical markers throughout Massachusetts but I hadn&#8217;t known much about their creation. As I researched the topic, I became more and more interested. In the NEHGS library, I discovered the best possible source, <em><a title=\"Historical Markers Erected by Massachusetts Bay Colony Tercentenary Commission, 1630&#8211;1930\" href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/historicalmarker00mass\" target=\"_blank\">Historical Markers Erected by Massachusetts Bay Colony Tercentenary Commission, 1630&#8211;1930</a></em>. The book reproduced the text of all the markers, and the resolution of 1930 that led to the markers&#8217; creation: &#8220;The department of public works is hereby authorized to prepare and erect suitable signs and markers, including such as may be submitted by the Massachusetts Bay Colony Tercentenary Commission, with suitable inscriptions thereon, indicating the ancient ways of the Puritan times and the structures or places relating to or associated with the early settlements within the commonwealth.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>I found that nearly three hundred cast iron markers had been installed within the territory of the original Massachusetts Bay Colony, to commemorate pre-1750 events and structures. The text was the same on both sides of the tablet &#8220;in order that a passer-by from either direction may read the inscription without descending from his car.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>The text of the Sturbridge marker read: &#8220;Tantiusques. The graphite or blacklead deposit near by was valued by the Indians for face paint, and by the white men for pencils and other uses. John Winthrop, Jr., was &#8216;granted the hill at Tantousq&#8217; in 1644, and began to exploit the mine in 1658.&#8221; Although there was no photograph of this marker in the book, I eventually found an image of it on an area blog, and the site administrator allowed me to reproduce it. </p>\r\n<p>Even though I&#8217;d found what I needed in the book, I found it hard to put it back on the shelf. I kept perusing the volume for interesting tidbits and comparing my knowledge of an area with the historical marker text. I began to pay more attention to the historical marker signs when I was out and about, and I am now always happy to notice a new one. </p>\r\n<p>Reading the <em>Boston Globe</em> Ideas section this past Sunday, I saw an eye-catching article by Chris Marshall, &#8220;<a title=\"History, Preserved in Sturdy Aluminum\" href=\"http://bostonglobe.com/ideas/2011/10/29/history-preserved-sturdy-aluminum/82ay0Le8UjWULp03laaqjM/story.html\" target=\"_blank\">History, Preserved in Sturdy Aluminum</a>,<strong>*</strong>&#8221; featuring six photos of markers, including, to my surprise, the Tantiusques one. Marshall wrote about the markers as &#8220;a standing museum of how the state saw its own past in the 1930s.&#8221; The man most responsible for the markers, colonial historian Samuel Eliot Morison, sought to humanize the Puritans and offer a richer portrayal of their lives and times. The markers &#8220;downplay the Puritans&#8217; religion, and instead put forward a broad-shouldered portrait of the settlers as literate community builders, industrialists, and pathmakers.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>Marshall also wrote about Robert Briere, who first saw the Tantiusques marker as a Sturbridge teenager in the 1940s &#8212; and noticed when it disappeared in the late 1980s. After retirement, Robert Brierly and his wife traveled the state, using a copy of Historical Markers to help them determine how many markers remained (about 144), and which were damaged. (The Tantiusques marker was eventually found nearby, cleaned, and restored to its original position.) Brierly hopes a bill, filed to get the Massachusetts Department of Transportation to allocate money to restore existing markers and replace missing ones, will be successful.&#160;</p>\r\n<p>I&#8217;m pleased to know that I&#8217;m not the only one who has discovered historical markers are worth a second look.</p>\r\n<p>For more information: </p>\r\n<p><a title=\"The Historical Marker Database\" href=\"http://www.hmdb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Historical Marker Database</a></p>\r\n<p><a title=\"Wikipedia entry on historical markers\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_marker\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia entry on historical markers<br></a>(A listing at the end includes many state historical marker websites.) </p>\r\n<p><a title=\"Waymarking.com\" href=\"http://www.waymarking.com/cat/search.aspx?f=1&amp;cst=7&amp;kw=historical%20markers&amp;st=2\" target=\"_blank\">Waymarking.com</a> contains a subcategory on historical markers</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"Roadside Markers\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedFiles/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Massachusetts/MBC-TC,%20Roadside%20Marker%20Inventory-to%20Tom%20Leonard%20(November%202011).pdf\" target=\"_blank\">View a compiled list of roadside markers</a>, prepared by&#160;&#160;Russell C.

W.S.Eldredge, of the New Orleans</p>\r\n<p>&#160;&#160;<i>&#8220;Blows out his brains in his room at the St. James Hotel-Stood before a mirror when he fired the shot-he had been employed by the Merchants and Miners Transportation Company, but was dismissed for failing to be on hand when his ship sailed, despondent and distressed, he took his life.&#8221;</i></p>\r\n<p>This was how the death of my great grandfather, Walter Eldredge, was characterized by the Baltimore newspapers in 1901. The Baltimore American, The Baltimore Sun and the Baltimore Sunday Herald all reported the event in varying details. There was always some suspicion in family circles regarding his death, and there is ample reason to believe foul play may have been involved. After looking into the details from newspaper accounts, and other sources, I am inclined to believe a murder most foul was committed.</p>\r\n<p>Walter Eldredge was born on the Cape in 1850, and was descended from a long line of Cape mariners. The Eldredges were among the earliest settlers of Chatham, and Walter&#8217;s heritage included Mayflower passengers as well as Royal descent. He married Emma Cecilia Crosby in 1872; she was the daughter of Elijah Crosby, another well known Cape mariner. Walter went to sea as a young teenager, and his exploits and feats of strength were well documented. On one of his earliest voyages, on the barque HARVESTER, the crew became embroiled with native Africans in the Gulf of Aden, who overtook the vessel. Young Eldredge saved the crew when the boat they were lowering to escape was swept away by heavy seas. He plunged overboard, swam for the boat and brought it back for the crew.</p>\r\n<p>The life of Walter Eldredge was full of these daring stories, attesting to the character of the man, who never walked away from adversity. He eventually earned his masters papers and was captain of several vessels, including the barque, Stillman B. Allen. As the days of sail gave way to steam, Walter became captain of these ships. Eventually he was hired by the Merchants and Miners Line, a steamship line that ran regular service between a number of East coast ports. Walter was captain of the Steamer State of Texas, on the regular run between Baltimore and Savannah.</p>\r\n<p>Typically, these trips took 10 to 15 days roundtrip, hauling both passengers and freight. As ship&#8217;s captain, Walter would have a cabin on the boat, and would not need rooms ashore. In reviewing the records of ship arrivals and departures, we can trace the events leading up to the fateful date of September 7, 1901. There are two events that have a bearing on our story. On April 10, 1901, the Texas rescued the crew of the wrecked schooner Erie off the Carolina Coast. According to one newspaper account, &#8220;Her gallant commander, Capt. W.S.Eldredge was congratulated and praised for saving the Erie&#8217;s crew from certain death.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>The second event happened on August 13, 1901. The Texas had been pulled from service a few days earlier for repairs, and replaced on the Savannah run by the steamship New Orleans. Under command of Capt. Eldredge, The New Orleans was leaving the inner basin of the Baltimore harbor, near Ft. McHenry &#160;(of Star Spangled Banner fame) when she was involved in a collision with a &#8220;bugeye&#8221;, the Rebecca J. White. Bugeye&#8217;s were shallow draft sailing craft that plied the waters of the Chesapeake Bay. According to the Wreck Report filed by Capt. Eldredge, the bugeye changed course right in front of the steamship, too late for the helmsman to avoid a collision. According to the report, the New Orleans stopped and offered assistance, but it was declined by the Capt. of the bugeye. As could be expected, the master of the bugeye, John Parks, claimed he held his course when the steamer hit him, and his boat was a total loss, including their cargo of watermelons. Was this sufficient cause to fire a skipper, who was a great hero 4 months earlier?</p>\r\n<p>On August 20, 1901, Capt. Eldredge returned to Baltimore from Savannah as Capt. of the New Orleans. On the following Thursday, it headed back to Savannah, but without Eldredge on board. On Sunday the 25<sup>th</sup>,&#160; Capt. Eldredge registered at the St. James Hotel, in the heart of Baltimore. about 6 city blocks above the offices of the&#160; steamship company, and possibly 12 blocks from the Savannah dock. Interestingly enough, he registered with his &#8220;wife&#8221;, whom he had married about 3 month earlier in Boston. Now 3 months earlier and through the spring and summer, he was making his regular run between Baltimore and Savannah, hardly time for a trip to Boston. It is also worth noting that he was still very much married to Emma Cecilia, who was living in Winthrop, with the family.</p>\r\n<p>Between the 25<sup>th</sup> of August and September 7<sup>th</sup>, he was in continuous residence at the St. James, and the steamer New Orleans made 2 trips to Savannah, so there was no reason for him to have missed a sailing, especially in view of the close proximity to the docks. According to the newspaper reports, during this period he made daily visits to the offices of Merchants and Miners. On Sunday, September 1<sup>st</sup>, the company claims Capt. Eldredge resigned. It would seem strange that this event would have been on a Sunday.&#160; On Friday, the 6<sup>th</sup>, he returned to the hotel from the company office and told the staff he would be leaving on the 30<sup>th</sup> of September with his next boat.</p>\r\n<p>On Sunday, the fateful day of his demise, he returned from the steamship&#8217;s office and sent for a carriage, this was about 12:30, and went for a ride with his &#8220;wife&#8221;. They returned shortly after 1 o&#8217;clock, and spent time in the hotel office in pleasant conversation with the employees. No one about the hotel had any suspicion that the cheerful, jovial sailor was about to take his life. The Baltimore American&#8217;s reporter gave this as the wife&#8217;s account of it.</p>\r\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#8220;After they had entered the room Captain Eldredge threw himself on the bed as if to go<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; to sleep. I thought he was asleep, and I had gone into the bathroom, attached to our<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; room. I had not been in there a minute when I heard the report of a pistol in the room.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I rushed out and found he had shot himself.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>Dr. F.W. Robertson, who keeps a drugstore under the hotel, heard the report of a pistol and hastened upstairs with the hotel&#8217;s manager and owner, Louis Sammani. When he arrived in the room Capt. Eldredge was lying on the floor on his back by the side of a small table in the center of the room, with the blood and portions of the brains flowing from a wound in the back of the head behind the ear.</p>\r\n<p>He had taken of his coat; his left hand was badly blackened with powder and extended out from his body, while his right lay close by his side. The pistol was found on the little table. There were drops and splashes of blood between the body and a wall mirror, suggesting he stood in front of the mirror, while he fired the fatal shot. Putting his left hand up over his head, he grasped the barrel of the revolver and held it to his head, while with the right he pulled the trigger, which would explain why there were no powder marks on the right hand. Eldredge was, incidentally, right handed.</p>\r\n<p>The pistol was an old fashioned, six cylinder, .44 caliber that was not self cocking, and fully loaded, with just one cartridge exploded. Coroner Saunders, of the Central district, decided an inquest unnecessary, and gave a certificate of suicide.</p>\r\n<p>And now, the mystery, was it suicide? Inquiries to both the Baltimore Police Department, and Chief Medical Examiner&#8217;s office were not helpful. Neither agency has any records that exist for this period. </p>\r\n<p>The gun in question, a .44 cal. Revolver, was a very heavy piece. This type of gun, in use in 1901 had a very long barrel, about 7&#8221;. The Eldredge room was on the third floor of the St. James hotel. This building is no longer in existence, but in its day was a handsome, solid stone structure. There was a drugstore on the ground floor. It is difficult to believe a shot; fired in a room on the third floor of a solid building would have been heard three floors below.</p>\r\n<p>The usual manner in which one kills oneself with a gun, is to take the gun, hold it to your temple or place it in your mouth and pull the trigger. If you take a rather heavy pistol, with a long barrel, it is almost impossible to hold it behind your ear with one hand and pull the trigger with the other, unless you&#8217;re a contortionist.</p>\r\n<p>A .44 cal. Pistol is an awesome weapon. Knowledgable people I have talked to, believe if you held a .44 to your head it would blow your head apart, where as there was just a wound behind the ear and the eye was swollen and discolored.</p>\r\n<p>It seems there was a rush to judgment, 2 days later, his body was sent home to Boston, on a ship of the very line that had &#8220;terminated&#8221; his employment.</p>\r\n<p>And what of the &#8220;wife&#8221;? She was never identified by any name other than the wife of Capt. Eldredge. She disappears from the scene, never to be interviewed again. If we assume the Captain was having a mid-life crisis, being away from his real family and wife, was this a local girl? Probably not, since the hotel management would have recognized her when she first registered.</p>\r\n<p>There is little to support his having been terminated for the bugeye incident, given his long track record of seamanship.</p>\r\n<p>Suppose, his little fling was coming to an end, and he was planning to return to Boston. The scorned woman decides to revenge this affront to her honor, by teaching the philandering Captain a lesson or two. Could there have been two guns involved? The first to do him in, the second a staged affair. The hotel management, not wanting a murder on the premises, goes along with the ploy. How very convenient to shoot oneself, and then very neatly place the gun on a little table before keeling over.</p>\r\n<p>Was it Murder at the St. James?</p>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/murder-st-james/", "published": "May 13, 2011", "id": 3}, {"author": "Peter D.

The internet\r\n has made it possible to access a richness of data undreamed of by our \r\npredecessors. Yet, there is at least one way in which the internet has \r\nmade our ancestors <em>less </em>accessible to us.&#160; Our world has become\r\n so small that it is now difficult, perhaps even impossible, to \r\nunderstand fully the degree to which the &#8220;local&#8221; once defined who and \r\nwhat one was.&#160; Most of our ancestors lived intensely &#8220;local&#8221; lives. <br><br>A\r\n newly acquired appreciation for the role of place in the lives of our \r\nancestors can provide a hoist over many of the most challenging \r\ngenealogical brick walls.&#160; Try to think as your ancestors thought.&#160; In \r\norder to do that, you will need to learn as much as possible about their\r\n local environments.&#160; If the subject of your search came from New \r\nBrunswick, you are in luck.&#160; A quick visit to the Provincial Archives&#8217; \r\nwebsite&#8212;<u><a href=\"http://archives.gnb.ca/\">http://archives.gnb.ca/</a></u>&#8212;will\r\n give you immediate access to a new database entitled &#8220;Where is Home? \r\n&#160;New Brunswick Communities Past and Present.&#8221; &#160;For each of the 4710 New \r\nBrunswick communities included, precise geographical locations are \r\nnoted, as are place name derivations and, in some instances, the \r\nhighlights of the community&#8217;s history. Links are provided to 4784 land \r\ngrant and other maps, to photographs of 489 of the communities (a total \r\nof 960 photos), and to approximately 600 documents about the founding, \r\nincorporation, or development of 144 of the communities. The entry for \r\nthe Kings County community of Stewarton is typical:</p>\r\n<p>Stewarton is 6.14 km NNW of Springfield, on the road to \r\nCambridge-Narrows in Springfield Parish, Kings County. William Cromwell \r\nsettled here about 1820. Included Cromwell. Post Office from1859 to1876 \r\nwith George Cromwell as postmaster. In 1866 Cromwell was a farming \r\nsettlement with about 30 families while in 1871 it had a population of \r\n100. In 1866 Stewarton included Waterloo Settlement which had 3 \r\nfamilies, also included the community of Ogilvie's. Post Office \r\nin&#160;Stewarton circa 1875-1958 with Alex Stewart as the first postmaster. \r\nIn 1898 Stewarton was a farming settlement with 1 post office, 1 store, 1\r\n grist and carding mill, 1 church and a population of 110.

They are the places where dreams were born, hopes sometimes \r\ndashed, where people engaged in the great human drama of living their \r\nlives.&#8221;<br><br>New Brunswick place names have been studied extensively, \r\nperhaps most notably by William Francis Ganong, 1864-1941, long time \r\nprofessor of Botany at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, and a\r\n native of the province. Drawing extensively on the work of Ganong and \r\nlater scholars, the &#8220;Where is Home&#8221; database reveals the ethno-cultural \r\nwealth which the province&#8217;s place names enshrine. The collection </p>\r\n<p>tells of the Aboriginal roots of names, of names brought from the Old\r\n Country by a host of immigrant groups who, proud of their new \r\nsurroundings and perhaps not a little lonesome, invoked the ancient \r\ntowns and regions from which they came. It tells of the influence of \r\nreligion on the province&#8217;s community nomenclature, as evidenced by our \r\n159 variations on the theme of Saint, and also of the occasional \r\ninfluence of nearby areas, as revealed by the 32 places in Madawaska \r\nCounty that have the French prefix &#8220;Rang des,&#8221; meaning &#8220;range of,&#8221; \r\nfollowed by a family name, as in Rang des Bourgoin. The practice comes \r\nfrom adjacent Quebec, where it was used to designate land grant \r\nsettlements.</p>\r\n<p>By situating every community in New Brunswick in the context of its \r\ncounty and civil parish, the &#8220;Where is Home&#8221; database provides a jumping\r\n off point for accessing relevant census records (all of which are \r\norganized by county and civil parish).</p>\r\n<p>Historians take it as a truism that the good historian is the one who\r\n begins by asking good questions. The good genealogist is the one who \r\nbegins by asking regarding his or her ancestors, &#8220;Where was home.&#8221;</p>\r\n</div></div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/where-is-home/", "published": "", "id": 4}, {"author": "Michael J. Leclerc", "country": "Canada", "title": "Accessing Records From a Distance", "content": "<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p>There are vast quantities of materials housed in repositories all  across the United States and Canada that are useful to genealogists.  Compiled genealogies, manuscripts, local histories, abstracted or  transcribed vital records, church records--the list goes on and on.  While our local libraries and other research facilities can offer a  broad range of materials to use, they will not be able to hold copies of every book for every area. No library can. Not even the Library of  Congress.</p>\r\n<p>The Family History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-day Saints (LDS) holds millions (over 2.5M at last count) of  records on microfilm. They do not have copies of all records either --  at least not yet. So how can a researcher access materials that are not  available to them in their own backyard? There are several ways.</p>\r\n<p>The first is to visit your local LDS Family History Center or the NEHGS Research Library.  Recognizing that not everyone can travel to Salt Lake City, LDS has set  up Family History Centers all across the country and all over the world, and has also allowed NEHGS to be a location where researchers can access LDS microfilm. Researchers can search for records&#160;on the FamilySearch website&#160;and request to have copies of microfilms sent to their local  center or NEHGS. See <a href=\"https://familysearch.org/films/\">familysearch.org/films/</a>&#160;for more information on this service.</p>\r\n<p>Another valuable resource is the interlibrary loan system. In 1902  the Library of Congress established itself as the \"library of last  resort\" and agreed to start lending some of its materials to other  libraries when the materials were not available elsewhere. This year the Library of Congress alone will handle over 50,000 requests for book  loans and photocopies.</p>\r\n<p>The American Library Association has established standards for  service through the interlibrary loan system. This system allows  materials from one library to be sent to another library for use by its  patrons. In many instances the materials may not be allowed to leave the library once they have arrived and you will need to use them only in  the building. Contact your local library to see if they are part of the  interlibrary loan system. Most public libraries do belong, but some  smaller ones may not.</p>\r\n<p>Many libraries now have their catalogs available for search on their  websites. When searching these catalogs it may not always be possible to determine whether or not the book is a circulating copy. Once you have  found a book in a catalog that you would like to borrow, print out the  bibliographic listing and bring it to your local library. If you cannot  print out a bibliographic listing, copy all of the information on the  book, including the title, author/editor, name and location of  publisher, year of publication, and Library of Congress or other call  number. Any other pertinent information given about the book should also be listed. Your librarian will then work with you to find and order a  copy of the book. The reference librarian can check databases such as  OCLC (Online Computer Library Center), to determine which, if any,  libraries might have a copy of the desired book.</p>\r\n<p>Not every book in every library is available for circulation. In  cases where the books do not circulate, photocopies of portions of a  book can be ordered. In addition, many articles from periodicals can be  photocopied and sent to you through the interlibrary loan system. The  Periodical Source Index (PERSI), available in most libraries and at <a href=\"http://www.ancestry.com/\" target=\"_new\">Ancestry.com</a>, will  provide not only citations for the periodicals in which articles were  originally published but also the names of libraries holding copies of  that periodical.</p>\r\n<p>Books and periodicals are not the only materials available on  interlibrary loan. Many repositories loan microforms as well. There may  be restrictions on which records are available for loan. The National  Archives and Records Administration (NARA), for example, will loan  copies of all U.S. census and Soundex microfilms. Unfortunately, it does not offer interlibrary loan of all materials. Passenger lists, for  example, are not available for loan. NARA lends materials to both  individuals and institutions. For details contact your local NARA  branch, which is online at <a href=\"http://www.nara.gov/\" target=\"_new\">http://www.nara.gov/</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The National Archives of Canada (NAC) is an invaluable resource for  interlibrary loan. Any part of their collection that is available on  microfilm is available for loan. Their catalog is available online as <a href=\"http://www.archives.ca/\" target=\"_new\">ArchiviaNet</a> at  www.archives.ca. NAC offers loans only to institutions, so you must use  the interlibrary loan system. </p>\r\n<p>Private research libraries may or may not offer parts of their  collection on interlibrary loan. </p>\r\n<p>Circulating library collections, the LDS Family History Center system and interlibrary loan are invaluable aids to performing research on  your Canadian ancestors. Talk to your local librarian or Family History  Center staff member to learn even more about them and discover how they  can help you do research without having to make costly trips to distant  repositories.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/accessing-records-from-a-distance/", "published": "", "id": 5}, {"author": "Michael J. Leclerc", "country": "Canada", "title": "Canadian Church Records", "content": "<p>Church records are an important supplement to vital records. In many areas \r\nthey are the only records available. They can fill in the blanks where vital \r\nrecords were not kept or were lost due to fire, flood, or the ravages of time. \r\nWhile they can be difficult to access, the mountain of information available \r\nthere is well worth the effort. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>When thinking of church records, many individuals focus solely on the \r\nsacramental registers dealing with baptisms, marriages, and burials. There are, \r\nhowever, a number of other records both sacramental and non-sacramental that \r\nwill provide excellent information for genealogists.</p>\r\n<p>The Roman Catholic Church recognizes seven sacraments: baptism, first \r\ncommunion, reconciliation (also known as penance), confirmation, matrimony, holy \r\norders, and anointing of the sick (formerly extreme unction). Many of these \r\npractices were continued by other denominations as they broke away from \r\nCatholicism and developed their own rites and rituals. </p>\r\n<p>In Christian religions baptism marks a spiritual rebirth (according to the \r\ndoctrine of the particular denomination) most often involving the symbolic \r\napplication of water. In denominations that practice infant baptism, records of \r\nthis sacrament can be used to approximate a date of birth. They are often used \r\nas a substitute when no civil or other record of birth exists. It is very \r\nimportant when using compiled sources to use the proper abbreviation in your \r\nnotations. Baptism is abbreviated as bp. or bap. and should never be shortened \r\nto b. The lower-case b. is an abbreviation for born. Respecting these practices \r\nwill alleviate potential problems. </p>\r\n<p>It is also important to be aware that not all denominations practiced infant \r\nbaptism. Some, such as the Baptists, practiced adult baptism. It would be a huge \r\nmistake to use baptismal records of such faiths to determine a date of birth or \r\nage. In many denominations it was common for a man or woman to be baptized at \r\nthe time of their acceptance into a particular congregation. Even the Catholic \r\nChurch practices adult baptism for those who convert to the faith later in \r\nlife.</p>\r\n<p>The sacrament of reconciliation is also known as penance or confession. \r\nChildren are introduced to this sacrament in preparation for their first \r\ncommunion. Individuals are supposed to practice this sacrament frequently but at \r\na minimum at least once per year during Lent (known as \"Easter Duty\"). Records \r\nof this sacrament were not usually kept and it is therefore not genealogically \r\nsignificant. </p>\r\n<p>First communion marks the start of full life in the church. More formal \r\nreligious education is commenced, and children are allowed to participate fully \r\nin services and to take the Host at communion time. In the Catholic Church \r\nchildren are usually given their first communion around the ages of seven or \r\neight. Records of first communion are not usually kept, but if found can help to \r\napproximate a year of birth.</p>\r\n<p>Confirmation is the rite by which individuals affirm their belief and \r\nadherence to the doctrines of their faith and their move into full adult \r\nparticipation in the church. In the Catholic Church one is usually confirmed \r\naround the ages of twelve to fourteen. Many parishes maintained lists of those \r\nconfirmed, and these records can also be used to approximate ages and/or dates \r\nof birth. Some parishes even recorded the age of the child at the time of \r\nconfirmation.</p>\r\n<p>The next sacrament that one would participate in is matrimony. Records of \r\nmarriage form one of the largest categories of church records. While many \r\ndenominations did not track (or possibly practice) baptism or last rites, most \r\nreligious groups performed marriages. The detail in these records varies from \r\nincluding just the names of the bride and groom and date of marriage to \r\nextensive lists of parents' names, occupations, witnesses, etc. </p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, in many denominations, records of marriages (and occasionally \r\nother records) were considered the property of the ministers. When the ministers \r\nleft for another parish, they took their record books with them. This can make \r\nit difficult to locate records for a particular church, as the minister could \r\nhave ended up halfway across the country in a remote town completely \r\nunassociated with your ancestors' hometown.</p>\r\n<p>One record group that is under-utilized is that of the sacrament of holy \r\norders. When researching ancestors it is very common to find children who seem \r\nto vanish. There are no marriage records for them, and they cannot be located in \r\ndeath/burial records. It is entirely possible that they may have entered \r\nreligious life. While many denominations allow ministers to be married, there \r\nare some that do not. Prior to women being allowed into ministry many who felt \r\nthe calling to religious life entered convents.</p>\r\n<p>Records of men entering the priesthood can be located on a diocesan level. \r\nRecords of men and women entering religious orders are often found at the home \r\nof the order. It is important to note that the home of the order may not even be \r\nlocated in Canada, but in the United States or Europe! Books such as the \r\n<em>Canadian Catholic Church Directory</em> (REF BX1421.2/A66/1995) or the \r\n<em>Official Catholic Directory</em> (REF BX845/C5) can be helpful in locating \r\nthese institutions. They may also have records of what houses or parishes the \r\nindividual was assigned to, as well as information on their date and place of \r\ndeath or burial.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the last sacrament one receives is Anointing of the Sick, formerly \r\ncalled Extreme Unction or Last Rites. Those who are experiencing grave illness \r\nand are not expected to recover are given a final opportunity to express remorse \r\nfor any sins they may have committed in life, and are absolved of those sins \r\nbefore passing on. Records of this sacrament are not usually kept, but when they \r\nare it is a good indication of a death occurring not too far in the future.</p>\r\n<p>Sacramental registers are not the only records kept by churches. The records \r\nof many Protestant denominations include records of admission and dismission. \r\nRecords of dismission from the church can be a harbinger of the family migrating \r\nelsewhere. Similarly, records of admission can signify a family's arrival in a \r\nnew location. </p>\r\n<p>Many women are baptized into a community shortly before the baptism of their \r\nchildren. It is not uncommon in records to see the words \"baptized and received \r\ninto full communion\" indicating an adult baptism and immediate participation in \r\nthe congregation. Records of baptism for children are often found shortly \r\nthereafter, many times as soon as the following week.</p>\r\n<p>Many parishes also kept records of burials in the church cemetery. It is not \r\nuncommon for even the smallest of towns and villages to have several cemeteries. \r\nThere may be a Catholic cemetery, one for Methodists, and one for Presbyterians \r\nas well as a non-denominational civil cemetery in the town. Civil cemeteries can \r\noften contain separate sections for people of different faiths. Church \r\ncemeteries are not always physically located next to the church.</p>\r\n<p>Many churches have had their records abstracted and published. This is most \r\ncommon in Qu&#233;bec, where both Catholic and non-Catholic parishes have had records \r\npublished for years. The most common records to be published were those of \r\nmarriages. It is important to note, however, that these transcriptions do not \r\nalways contain all of the information in the original record. Additional \r\ninformation on residences, occupation, parents' names, etc. can be found by \r\nexamining the original records.</p>\r\n<p>Many parishes have had their records microfilmed. The individual provincial \r\narchives have many reels of these records. In some instances you may be able to \r\nborrow these reels through inter-library loan. Contact the appropriate archives \r\nfor more details on this procedure. See <a>my \r\nprevious article on governmental agencies</a> for information on how to contact \r\nthe various archives.</p>\r\n<p>Another important source of these records is the Family History Library. \r\nSearch the <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\">Family History \r\nLibrary Catalog</a> under the name of the town your researching in. When the \r\nresults categories are returned, look for the \"church records\" heading. For \r\nexample, a search of Shelburne, Nova Scotia, turned up the records of the \r\nparishes of Saint George and Saint Patrick, including baptisms, marriages, \r\nburials, and lists of communicants.</p>\r\n<p>Church records give a wealth of information to the family historian. Make \r\nsure you do not limit yourself to the sacramental registers, but look for all \r\ninformation available in the records. Besides the records found here you can \r\nfind information on the purchase of pews, the ordination of deacons and other \r\nchurch elders, and a myriad of other information to help you in your \r\nsearch.</p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/canadian-church-records/", "published": "December 27, 2002", "id": 6}, {"author": "Michael J.

Among those titles are hundreds of \r\nvolumes of material on Canada, many of which are difficult to find or out of \r\nprint. These rare volumes can give you tremendous information about your \r\nancestors and how they lived. The following are some examples of the treasures \r\nto be found in these materials. \r\n<p>For those with Loyalist ancestors there are materials such as <em>The Camden \r\nColony or The Seed of the Righteous: A Story of the United Empire Loyalists</em> \r\nby Rev. W. Boaman Tucker, M.A., Ph.D. (Montreal, PQ: John Lovell &amp; Son, \r\nLimited, 1908) [CS90/M55/1908]. This volume focuses on the Miller family with a \r\nnarrative that traces the Loyalists back into the origins of Europe. </p>\r\n<p>Thousands of individuals emigrated from Scotland to Canada, with some coming \r\nthrough England, Ireland, and Wales. Others settled in Canada for a while before \r\neventually moving on to the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and \r\nelsewhere. Donald Whyte has spent decades researching these individuals. The \r\nresult of his work is <em>A Dictionary of Scottish Emigrants to Canada Before \r\nConfederation</em> (Toronto, ON: Ontario Genealogical Society, 1986) [Ref \r\nF1035/S4/W49/1985].&#160; </p>\r\n<p>This fully documented work contains over 12,500 individuals who immigrated to \r\nCanada prior to 1867. Listings are in alphabetical order, and each immigrant is \r\ngiven a unique identifying number.

The first \r\nvolume is split into two parts: information culled from manuscripts and that \r\ntaken from Nova Scotia periodicals. Volume two contains materials taken from \r\nperiodicals outside of Nova Scotia and from published diaries and journals.</p>\r\n<p>These works cover a broad range of immigrants to Nova Scotia and do not focus \r\non any particular groups. The amount of information available varies from \r\nindividual to individual, and all entries are documented with source citations \r\nlisted alphabetically in the back of the book.

R. Wallace Hale compiled \r\n<em>Early New Brunswick Probate Records 1785-1835 </em>&#160;(Bowie, MD: Heritage \r\nBooks, 1989) [CS88/N33/H36/1989], in which he reviewed and abstracted over 2,000 \r\nprobate files covering all counties in the first fifty years of the province of \r\nNew Brunswick. In the introduction Hale explains his research process, cites \r\nguides that were consulted, and, most importantly, identifies missing data (such \r\nas files for Kent County which were destroyed by fire in 1940). </p>\r\n<p>The abstractions are quite detailed and provide much valuable information for \r\nresearchers. They are listed alphabetically by last name. Each entry begins with \r\nthree pieces of information: the location of the individual; the date of the \r\nwill if one was filed; and the date the will was proven (or, in the case of \r\nintestate individuals, the date administration was granted). Information that \r\nHale was unable to decipher is included in brackets. Surnames are printed in all \r\ncaps to make them easier to see on the page. The following example shows the \r\nkind of information available.</p>\r\n<p>PETERS, Thomas</p>\r\n<p>Parish of Fredricton, York Co.

Among them are three cornerstones of \r\nFrench-Canadian research: Rene Jett&#233;&#8217;s <em>Dictionnaire g&#233;n&#233;alogique de \r\nQu&#233;bec</em> (Montreal, QC: Les Presses de l&#8217;Universit&#233; de Montr&#233;al, 1983) [REF \r\nCS81/J4/1983]; P&#233;re Cyprien Tanguay&#8217;s <em>Dictionnaire g&#233;n&#233;alogique des familles \r\nCanadiennes: depuis la fondation de la colonie jusqu&#8217;a nos jours</em>&#160; (orig. pub \r\n1871, reprint: Pawtucket, RI: Quinton-Rock Publications, 1982) [CS88/T3/1871]; \r\nand Claude Drouin&#8217;s <em>Dictionnaire national des Canadiens-Fran&#231;aises \r\n(1608-1760)</em> (Montr&#233;al, QC: Institute G&#233;n&#233;alogique Drouin, 1979) \r\n[CS81/D53/1979].</p>\r\n<p>In addition to these basic works, one can find information on the early \r\nsettlers of New France in works such as Robert Larin&#8217;s <em>La contribution du \r\nHaut-Poitu au peuplement de la Nouvelle France </em>&#160;(Moncton, NB: Les editions \r\nd&#8217;Acadie, 1994). A large number of early immigrants came from this section of \r\nFrance to settle in Acadia and Qu&#233;bec. This work details their migrations, and \r\nprovides information about the individuals known to have originated there. The \r\nimmigrants are listed by town of origin and assigned a unique identifying \r\nnumber. Brief descriptions of towns are also included. The work is written in \r\nFrench, but the biographical information is easily translated with a basic \r\nFrench dictionary for those who do not speak the language.

I remember playing in the chancery in Brighton, and only when I was older realizing that the impressive man I had met there was actually Richard Cardinal Cushing, the leader of the Archdiocese of Boston. It was only when I started researching my family history that I discovered that Sister Florence was the same woman as the Aunt Vi my mother&#8217;s cousin always referred to. </p>\r\n<p>When researching your ancestors and their families, it is commonplace to find individuals who seem to disappear. A record of birth or baptism is found, but marriage, death, burial, and other information is elusive. Sometimes these individuals died as children, but it is especially puzzling to find children living with the family to young adulthood in census records only to vanish without a trace. All too easily many make the assumption that the individual died without leaving a record. But there are other possibilities as well. The child may have left home and gone to a distant place or they may never have married. One possibility that is frequently overlooked is that the child entered the priesthood or religious life.</p>\r\n<p>In 1648 Pope Alexander VII created the apostolic vicarate of Qu&#233;bec and Fran&#231;ois de Laval was named the apostolic vicar for the area. In 1674 the vicarate was elevated to the level of archdiocese, and Monseigneur de Laval became the first bishop in New France.&#160; By 1995 there were thirty-five dioceses and eleven archdioceses in Ontario and eastern Canada alone. In addition, there were sixty-six religious orders of priests, fifteen religious orders of brothers, and one hundred twenty seven religious orders of women operating in Canada. And this is just for the Roman Catholic Church! This does not include other branches of the Catholic Church (such as the Melkites or Eastern Orthodox), Anglicans, or other denominations who have their own branches of religious life. An amazingly tangled web of possibilities for disappearing ancestors!</p>\r\n<p>Large numbers of Irish Catholic families sent at least one member of the family into religious life: either a son into the priesthood or a daughter to become a nun. While common among French-Canadians, it was not as frequent as it was among the Irish. Most of the time it was a younger member of the family that entered religious life. The older children were helping to support the family farm (or other family business). In Qu&#233;bec, where most Catholic children went to parochial school instead of public school, there was tremendous pressure to join religious life. </p>\r\n<p>It can be difficult to locate individuals after they joined the clergy or a religious order. After their religious education and formal entry into the priesthood or religious life, many individuals end up stationed far away from the town or village where they were raised. In the Roman Catholic Church these individuals are barred from marrying. Oftentimes those in religious orders adopt names with religious significance. Marie Heloise Houde could become Soeur Jeanne Fran&#231;oise. Joseph Thivierge could become Fr&#233;re Jacques. In my own family, Viola Angeline Morin became Sister Florence, i.j.a.</p>\r\n<p>The first step in researching these individuals is to determine what parish they lived in. Once this is known, it is easy to discover the diocese or archdiocese the parish is located in. It is important to recognize when dioceses were created, as the boundaries change over time and you will be researching different dioceses and different areas (much like the changing of county and township boundaries).<br><br>Once the area has been located, determine if there is a seminary or convent nearby. Those destined for religious life studied for years before taking their vows. Nuns especially ran many primary and secondary schools. It is important once a school, convent, or seminary has been located to determine the order it was associated with. This is necessary because in many instances, the records are not kept locally, but sent to the mother house of the order. Canadian priests, brothers, and sisters were in charge of many institutions in the United States as well, and it would not be unusual to have to write to Canada to obtain records of these US institutions. Many local groups made note in their records of those who went on to further religious study and take their final vows.</p>\r\n<p>Once you have identified the local seminary, convent, or school, write to it and determine if they have any surviving records of these individuals. Then write to the mother house and ask if they have any records. Ask what the major centers of religious education were in the time period you are researching, to help identify where additional records may be found. If you know an ancestor was a priest or religious, search for records that mention the order that the person belonged to. If you cannot find the order, check for any mention of postnomials, which will identify the order. For example, Sister Florence, i.j.a. was a member of the Soeurs de l&#8217;Institut de Jeanne d&#8217;Arc. </p>\r\n<p>Another method of identifying the order is to look at what your ancestor did in religious life. Religious orders are dedicated to specific kinds of service, such as teaching, nursing, and missionary work. Knowing what kind of service your ancestor performed will reduce the types of orders you will need to search. Conversely, knowing which order your ancestor belonged to can tell you what kind of service he or she performed. If you know that your ancestor was a teacher, but you can&#8217;t identify the order she belonged to, try contacting the <a href=\"http://www.ssnd.org/\" target=\"new\">School Sisters of Notre Dame</a>. They run many schools throughout the United States and Canada. A male ancestor who was an educator in religious life may have been a member of the <a href=\"http://www.mindspring.com/~mcguidance/Brothers.htm\" target=\"new\">Brothers of the Sacred Heart</a>. </p>\r\n<p>Knowing what name your ancestor adopted in religious life can also give insight into his or her personality. These individuals took the names of saints that they wanted to emulate. In some orders the names were given to them by the mother or sister superior, either in recognizance of particular traits or an attempt to curtail other, less desirable habits.</p>\r\n<p>Many churches and other religious institutions published histories, especially around the time of major anniversaries such as centennials, sesquicentennials, and bicentennials. These histories often contain rich biographical information on parish priests and other prominent individuals. Local newspapers also published this information in many instances.</p>\r\n<p>Published biographies are also available. Jean-Baptiste Arthur Allaire compiled the six-volume <em>Dictionnaire Biographique du Clerg&#233; Canadien-Fran&#231;ais</em> between 1908 and 1934. This set, which is available at the NEHGS Library (REF F1005/A4), contains over 3,000 pages of biographical information on priests from the province throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Prominent individuals can often be found in the <em>Dictionary of Canadian Biography</em> .</p>\r\n<p>To locate parishes, dioceses, convents, schools, and seminaries there are different avenues of approach. A valuable website for Catholics in Canada is <a href=\"http://www.catholicanada.com/\" target=\"new\">www.catholicanada.com</a>, which has links to dioceses, archdioceses, and other organizations throughout the country. For information on saints&#8217; names try visiting <a href=\"http://www.catholic.org/saints\" target=\"new\">www.Catholic.org/saints</a>. The official website in the English language for the Vatican is <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/phome_en.htm\" target=\"new\">www.vatican.va/phome_en.htm</a>. </p>\r\n<p>Researching ancestors who entered religious life can be challenging, but it can also be rewarding. There are many clues to give you insight into their personalities that are unavailable elsewhere. And who knows how many &#8220;vanished&#8221; ancestors you may locate? Sister Florence was born in Connecticut and spent her entire life working in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Vermont. She died in Montr&#233;al at the age of ninety-one, after spending her retirement years in the mother house of her order, located in that city. Without knowing that she joined a religious order, other descendants of my great-grandparents might have difficulty determining what happened to this woman. Yet she lived a long, amazing life, the highlights of which included service to two cardinals and to Pope John Paul II on his historic trip to Boston. Having researched Sister Florence&#8217;s travels in the Institut de Jeanne d&#8217;Arc, I am next setting my sights on great Aunt &#201;merentienne Dub&#233;, a Gray Nun from Brunswick, Maine. I can only imagine the life that she led.</p>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/did-your-ancestor-get-religion/", "published": "", "id": 8}, {"author": "Michael J. Leclerc", "country": "Canada", "title": "Finding Clues to Immigrant Origins", "content": "<p>One of the most difficult parts of researching your family's origins in \r\nCanada is to determine where exactly they came from. In so many frustrating \r\ncases, the place of birth is given as just Canada. How can the precise origins \r\nbe located when the only known information is Canada? </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>There are two major things to keep in mind before starting your research. The \r\nfirst is the problem of name changes. This is more of a problem for Francophones \r\nthan any other group. In addition to the usual problems of non-standardized name \r\nspellings, English-speaking town clerks had a difficult time understanding many \r\nof the French-speaking residents. Names such as Lajoie became Lashua. It is \r\nimportant to sound out names and try different spelling variations when looking \r\nfor your ancestors. </p>\r\n<p>A common but false assumption is that all French came from Qu&#233;bec and all the \r\nIrish and Scots from Nova Scotia. Major migration came into New England from all \r\nprovinces in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Francophones \r\ninhabited every province in Canada and many Irish families settled in Qu&#233;bec for \r\ngenerations before descendants moved to New England. Always keep an open mind \r\nwhen looking through records and don't make assumptions without the facts to \r\nback them up. Even family traditions should be called into question if no \r\nsubstantial evidence exists to prove them. Just because there was a Hebert \r\nimmigrant to Nova Scotia in the 1600s doesn't mean that your Hebert family came \r\nfrom Lunenburg County instead of Montr&#233;al. That being said, let's take a look at \r\nsome options. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Vital Records</strong></p>\r\n<p>The first step should be to examine all available vital records in the United \r\nStates for clues. Often these clues are subtle, and unfamiliarity with the \r\nterminology contained in these records might lead to erroneous conclusions. For \r\nexample, a record might give the place of birth as Canada East. On first glance, \r\nthis might indicate a place of birth as Nova Scotia or New Brunswick. In \r\nreality, this record names the exact province of birth - Qu&#233;bec. Unlike the \r\nUnited States, where most states have kept the same name, the names of the \r\nprovinces of Canada have changed over time. Lower Canada and Canada East are \r\ndifferent names for the province of Qu&#233;bec. Familiarize yourself with the \r\nvarious names of each province so that subtle clues like this one can be \r\ndetected. </p>\r\n<p>In the New England states, vital records are kept on a local level (usually \r\nby the town clerk) and a copy is sent to the state. The information on the state \r\ncopy may not be identical to the information on the local copy. For example, in \r\nthe state of Massachusetts, early death records on the state level do not \r\ninclude the place of burial but many of the local copies actually give the \r\ncemetery name. It is very important to examine both copies or you may miss a \r\ncrucial piece of information. </p>\r\n<p>It is possible to find three original records relating to the same event, but \r\ncopied by different persons and kept in different places. For example, doctors \r\nor undertakers would usually create death records, especially in large towns and \r\ncities. A \"Return of Death\" form was filled out and filed with the town clerk. \r\nThe clerk then copied the information into the local death register books. The \r\nrecord would then be copied yet again, this time into the ledger books sent to \r\nthe state. Information was not always transcribed completely when moving from \r\none version to the next. Examine all copies whenever possible. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Church Records</strong></p>\r\n<p>Once the original vital records have been examined, take the time to look at \r\noriginal church records. Records of baptism, marriage, and burial may contain \r\nvital clues. For example, look at the names of the individuals who acted as \r\ngodparents to children at their baptism. These godparents were often brothers, \r\nsisters, aunts, uncles, or cousins. Check the vital records of these individuals \r\nfor clues to their place of origin as this may help you locate your own \r\nancestors. At the very least the sponsors may have been close family friends \r\nthat came from the same village in Canada. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Marriage Records</strong></p>\r\n<p>Marriage records, especially in the Catholic Church, can be extremely \r\nhelpful. In order to be married in the Catholic Church one had to demonstrate \r\nproof of baptism. Parish priests often wrote these places of birth in the \r\nmargins of the parish registers. Many Franco-American Catholic parishes have had \r\ntheir records transcribed and published over the years. These transcriptions can \r\nbe very helpful, but do not rest there. Make sure to examine the original \r\nrecords, as the marginal notes may not have been copied when the records were \r\ntranscribed for publication. Also, when writing to a parish for a copy of the \r\noriginal record, ask if it would be possible to have a photocopy of the \r\noriginal. Marginal notes are often left off of the fill-in-the-blank forms that \r\nmost parishes currently use for providing copies of birth, marriage, and burial \r\ncertificates. If that is not possible, ask the priest (or church secretary) to \r\nmake sure that all marginal notes are included when they copy the record for \r\nyou. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Naturalization Records</strong></p>\r\n<p>Naturalization records can be quite helpful in identifying an immigrant's \r\nplace of origin. The National Archives Northeast Region in Waltham (380 Trapelo \r\nRoad, Waltham, MA. 02452) has one of the best collections of naturalization \r\nrecords in the United States. They hold the original naturalization records for \r\nall federal courts in the New England states from 1790 to 1906. They also have \r\ndexigraph copies of naturalization records from most non-federal courts covering \r\nthe same year span for Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and \r\nVermont. Original naturalization records (1790-1906) for the non-federal courts \r\nin Connecticut are available as well. </p>\r\n<p>The archives also keep a large collection of post-1906 naturalization \r\nrecords. They have the original records from all federal courts in New England \r\nand all courts in Connecticut. The time frame of the holdings varies from state \r\nto state. </p>\r\n<p>The dexigraph copies were created as a Works Progess Administration (WPA) \r\nproject during the Great Depression. The intent was to photostat naturalization \r\nrecords from all courts in New England. Unfortunately, not all of the courts had \r\ntheir records copied. A list of all courts that did have records copied is \r\navailable at the National Archives in Waltham. In addition to the dexigraph \r\ncopies, a soundex was created for the pre-1906 records held at the archives. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Naturalization records will often (but not always) give the date and place of \r\nbirth. The place of birth given may not state the specific town but should at \r\nleast give the province of origin in Canada as well as the date and place of \r\narrival in the United States. If your ancestor arrived in the United States \r\nafter 1895, their arrival may be documented in the St. Albans Border Crossing \r\nrecords. [See the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/research/services/articles_saint_albans_arrival.asp\">research article on \r\nSt. Albans Border Crossings</a> elsewhere on this website for further details on \r\nusing these records.] </p>\r\n<p><strong>Obituaries</strong></p>\r\n<p>Obituaries can also be a source of information on place of birth. In addition \r\nto the place of residence, occupation, and heirs one can often find the place of \r\nbirth given in the obituaries of individuals who were born in Canada but died in \r\nthe United States. Daily and weekly newspapers are the most common, source of \r\nobituaries and death notices. However, organizational and alumni publications \r\nwill also quite often have necrology columns. Remember that the information in \r\nobituaries is usually given by the next of kin and is therefore subject to the \r\nlimitations of their knowledge. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Voter Registration Records</strong></p>\r\n<p>One little-used source of information is voter registration records. Most of \r\nthese records start at the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. \r\nInformation recorded usually includes name, residence, occupation, and place of \r\nbirth. Foreign-born residents had to provide proof of citizenship when they \r\nregistered to vote. The date and place of their naturalization is usually \r\nrecorded, sometimes including the actual certificate numbers to make locating \r\nthe original record easier. </p>\r\n<p>In addition to becoming naturalized in their own right, a person could become \r\nnaturalized if their father became a citizen while the child was still a minor. \r\nA woman could also become a citizen by marrying a citizen of the United States, \r\nor if her husband became naturalized. All of above scenarios are known as \r\nderivative citizenship. When a person registered to vote, they were required to \r\nprovide the date and place of naturalization of their father (or husband). This \r\ncan be extremely helpful when trying to establish familial relationships between \r\npeople who have very common names (like Patrick Murphy). Most voter registration \r\nrecords have not yet been microfilmed and are still available in the local town \r\noffices. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Military Records</strong></p>\r\n<p>The draft registration cards of World War I provide a fountain of information \r\non male ancestors. There were three registrations of males in the United States \r\nfor draft lottery purposes. The first registration took place June 5, 1917, for \r\nmen who were born between 1886 and 1896 (age 21-31 at the time). The \r\nregistration card included information on the person's name, address, date of \r\nbirth, place of birth, age, race, citizenship, occupation, employer, marital \r\nstatus, and dependant relatives. The second registration took place June 5, \r\n1918, for men born between 1896 and 97 (age 20-22 at the time). The registration \r\ncard for these individuals, in addition to the above information, asked for \r\nfather's place of birth. The third registration occurred September 12, 1918, for \r\nmen born between 1873 -and 1886 and 1897 and 1900 (ages 18-21 and 32-45 at the \r\ntime). This last card also asked for information on the name and residence of \r\nthe next of kin. </p>\r\n<p>It is important to note that all males residing in the United States, \r\nregardless of their citizenship status, filled out the draft registration cards. \r\nIf you have an individual who never naturalized, these records may provide an \r\nexcellent substitute to get you back to the place of origin. The next of kin for \r\nrecent immigrants may actually list the names and addresses of relatives still \r\nliving in Canada at the time. </p>\r\n<p>World War I Draft Registration Cards are available on microfilm at the <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/\" target=\"new\">National Archives </a>and through the \r\n<a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\" target=\"new\">Family History Library </a>in \r\nSalt Lake City. The records are arranged state by state. Each state is organized \r\nby draft board. It is necessary to know the address of an individual to locate \r\nthem in the records. In large cities, it may be necessary to look through \r\nseveral draft boards to locate the proper registration card. </p>\r\n<p>In addition to the federal draft registration, the state of Connecticut \r\nconducted a military preparedness survey in February1917. All males living in \r\nthe state, as well as female nurses, were asked to fill out surveys. The \r\ninformation included name, address, occupation, age, height, weight, marital \r\nstatus, dependents, physical disability, and questions about various skills, \r\nsuch as horseback riding, wireless operation, navigation, and so forth. There \r\nare also three questions on citizenship: Are you a citizen of the US? If not, \r\nhave you taken out first papers? If not, what is your nationality? Another \r\nquestion asks about military service \"in this or any other country.\" This \r\nquestion can lead to information in the <a href=\"http://www.archives.ca/\" target=\"new\">Canadian Archives</a> if the individual served in the military before \r\nemigrating. </p>\r\n<p>These are just some of the ways to pinpoint your ancestor's place of origin. \r\nThe more precise information you can glean from records in the United States the \r\nbetter off you will be when turning north to continue the search for your \r\nfamily. Search all the records and examine all the information with care, and \r\nhopefully you will be amply rewarded. </p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/finding-clues-to-immigrant-origins/", "published": "July 19, 2002", "id": 9}, {"author": "Peter D. Murphy", "country": "Canada", "title": "Identifying the Old Country Origins of Your New Brunswick Irish Ancestor", "content": "<p>Nothing can quite compare to the experience of standing &#8212; for the first \r\ntime \r\n&#8212; in the ruins of one&#8217;s ancestral home beneath a blue Irish sky! But in \r\norder to \r\nhave that experience, you will need to discover the single most sought \r\nafter &#8212; \r\nand the single most elusive &#8212; piece of information the genealogist \r\nseeks: Where \r\ndid my immigrant ancestor come from? (Or, perhaps more accurately, where\r\n do \r\n<em>I</em> come from?) Many of us have little more to go on than a name \r\nand a \r\nvague sense of Irishness. Where do we begin?</p>\r\n<p>I am blessed &#8212; or cursed &#8212; to count two unrelated Murphys among my sixteen \r\ngreat-great-grandparents. &#160;For most genealogists, the search for a specific \r\nplace of origin in the &#8220;old-country&#8221; might be compared to a search for the \r\nproverbial needle in a haystack. &#160;There are Murphys in every parish in Ireland! \r\n&#160;All that said, the occurrence of a surname with a seemingly <em>regional</em> \r\nflavour is often much more localized than even the locals realize. &#160;To anyone \r\nborn in southern New Brunswick, the surnames Sherwood and Kierstead &#8212; to cite \r\ntwo of many possible examples &#8212; sound nearly as common as Smith and Jones will \r\nto an Englishman.&#160; On close examination of nineteenth century census records, \r\nhowever, one would find these names concentrated in only one or two rural Kings \r\nCounty parishes.&#160; Similarly, a tour through rural west Cork could, in some \r\nrespects, be compared to a drive through New Brunswick&#8217;s Acadian Peninsula.&#160; (On \r\nthis stretch of the road, every second house is occupied by a Legere [a Driscoll \r\nin Cork]; now, clearly, we are in LeBlanc [O&#8217;Mahoney] territory.) &#160;So in its \r\nIrish context a name can reveal a lot more than one might expect. &#160;And the same \r\nis true both of surnames and Christian names.&#160; You tell me that you immigrant \r\nancestor was called Moses Whalen. &#160;If I were a betting man, I would wager a \r\nthousand dollars he was born in Waterford or Wexford.&#160; Why? &#160;Because among Irish \r\nCatholics, the Christian name Moses was used almost exclusively in Counties \r\nWaterford and Wexford. &#160;Florence is a &#8220;girl&#8217;s name.&#8221;&#160; Not in County Cork!&#160; The \r\nlist goes on and on.&#160; So where does one begin his search for Irish origins? \r\n&#160;Begin with the name of your immigrant ancestor.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Patterns of Immigration:</strong></p>\r\n<p>When undertaking genealogical or biographical research, it is always helpful \r\nto learn as much as one can about the general history of the area where one&#8217;s \r\nsubject settled. &#160;This is true not least of all because humans are in large \r\nmeasure <em>formed</em> by their environments.&#160; What sort of education we \r\nreceive, whom we marry&#160; . . . and a host of other realities of our adult lives \r\nare more or less determined by the situation of our birth and upbringing.&#160; When \r\nit comes to identifying the specific place of origin of an Irish immigrant \r\nancestor, the first question the researcher ought to ask is: &#160;Where did she \r\nsettle? &#160;Irish immigration to and settlement in New Brunswick, while a complex \r\nprocess, was determined, in the first instance, by pre-existing trade links \r\nbetween ports in Ireland and in New Brunswick.</p>\r\n<p>&#160;In the vast majority of cases, the earliest waves of immigrants simply set \r\nsail from the port nearest their home village or townland and ended up &#8220;across \r\nthe pond&#8221; &#8212; in&#160; Miramichi, St. Andrews or Saint John, for instance &#8212; simply \r\nbecause that&#8217;s where the vessel was headed. </p>\r\n<p><em>Settlement</em> in a host community was possible and followed immigration \r\nonly where there was a hope of viable employment. As an example, a group of \r\nfishermen from the Cooley Peninsula of County Louth ended up settling together \r\nin the Lower Cove district of Saint John because, while the local New \r\nBrunswick-born fishing population had gone on to &#8220;bigger and better things&#8221; &#8212; in \r\nterms of employment &#8212; they nevertheless continued to <em>eat</em> fish.&#160; In New \r\nBrunswick, several large-scale regionally-based patterns of settlement developed \r\nas a result of prior (and ongoing) trade links. <strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>St. Andrews</strong>:&#160; During the first quarter of the nineteenth \r\ncentury, the port of St. Andrews in Charlotte County developed strong links with \r\nthe Irish ports of Derry (or Londonderry) and Donegal.&#160; Eventually, the town of \r\nSt. Andrews and adjacent communities became home to large numbers of immigrants \r\nfrom Derry and Donegal and their environs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Saint John</strong><strong>:&#160; </strong>Saint John&#8217;s pre-eminence \r\nas<strong> </strong>a trading port laid the foundation for a complex web of \r\ntransatlantic migration patterns. &#160;While significant numbers of&#160; Irish \r\nimmigrants sailed to Saint John from the ports of Liverpool, Newry (in County \r\nDown), or Sligo (and several other small ports in west Cork), the great majority \r\nof Irish arriving in Saint John in the nineteenth century sailed from Donegal or \r\nDerry in the north and Cork (Cobh) in the south.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Miramichi: </strong>If your immigrant ancestor settled on the banks \r\nof the Miramichi, chances are he or she hailed from within fifty miles of the \r\nCity of Waterford or from somewhere in Counties Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, \r\nTipperary, or east Cork. &#160;As early as the seventeenth century, trade links had \r\ndeveloped between Waterford and the ports of Newfoundland &#8212; based initially on a \r\nseasonal fishing migration.&#160; Eventually, the &#8220;Waterford Pattern&#8221; extended to \r\nembrace much of northern Nova Scotia and the Miramichi.</p>\r\n<p>By the beginning of the twentieth century, people of Irish birth or ancestry \r\nhad settled in every county and in every parish of New Brunswick.&#160; If your \r\nancestor settled in an area remote from the principal ports of entry, it may be \r\ndifficult to identify his or her place of origin in Ireland.&#160; If, for instance, \r\nyour Irish-born great-great-grandfather, Michael Sullivan, ended his days in \r\nMadawaska County, it might be reasonable to ask yourself if he arrived in the \r\nNew World at Qu&#233;bec.&#160; In any case, it is important to remember that patterns \r\nspeak to the generalities of life and where genealogical research is concerned \r\nwe are looking at the specifics. &#160;While it is helpful to know that the majority \r\nof Irish settlers on the Miramichi came from the vicinity of Waterford, it does \r\nnot necessarily follow that <em>your </em>Irish-born Miramichi ancestor did.&#160; \r\nAfter all, we are talking about an individual and individuals seldom conform to \r\nevery pattern.&#160; I can think of several Irish-born settlers in Kent County who \r\narrived in Saint John, of Saint John settlers who arrived at St. Andrews, and of \r\nat least one Miramichi settler who first set foot in the New World at \r\nBoston!</p>\r\n<p><strong></strong><strong>The Gregarious Irish:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Wherever they have gone, the Irish &#8212; Catholic or Protestant &#8212; have looked for \r\npeople from their home village or townland and, where possible, they have \r\nencouraged the immigration of their extended families and friends and \r\nfacilitated their settlement.&#160; This point becomes particularly salient when \r\ntrying to trace the old-country place of origin of an ancestor.&#160; Perhaps your \r\ngreat-great-grandmother, Mary (Sullivan) O&#8217;Brien, left no trace of her \r\nbirthplace. &#160;Suddenly, the fact that her next-door neighbour was a Jeremiah \r\nSullivan becomes more significant to your search than it might have been had \r\nMary&#8217;s tombstone noted that she was &#8220;a native of Clonakilty, County Cork.&#8221;&#160; \r\nBefore investing countless hours trying to determine an \r\nold-country-place-of-origin, it is essential that the researcher ask himself the \r\nfollowing questions:&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>1</strong>. &#160;<em>Did my ancestor marry or have children in Ireland? \r\n</em>Looking for Paddy Driscoll&#8217;s birthplace in County Cork &#8212; where Driscoll is \r\nas common as Doucet in New Brunswick&#8217;s Gloucester County &#8212; might take decades.&#160; \r\nBut, if you know that Paddy married a Copithorne before emigrating, a little \r\ndigging will lead you inevitably to the Parish of Creagh or one of the adjacent \r\nparishes in west Cork where one is likely to find the only Copithornes in the \r\ncounty.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong><em>What, if anything, do I know about my \r\nimmigrant-ancestor&#8217;s siblings, extended family and friends? </em>Perhaps the \r\ndeath notice of your ancestor, James Sproul, noted only that he was &#8220;a native of \r\nCounty Tyrone, Ireland,&#8221; while that of his eldest and only Irish-born son, \r\nCharles, recorded that <em>he</em> was &#8220;a native of Strabane, County Tyrone and \r\nsixty-six years a resident of Sh&#233;diac.&#8221; &#160;Remember, it is much easier to search \r\nthe same records for more than one individual that to make <em>several \r\n</em>trips to distant research facilities.&#160; When possible, approach the key \r\nsources knowing who your ancestor chose as baptismal sponsors for his or her \r\nchildren, and who witnessed her wedding or his will.&#160; Remember, we Irish are a \r\nclannish bunch!</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Main Sources:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>I. Death Notices:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Newspaper death notices served different purposes in different places.&#160; If \r\nyour immigrant-ancestor lived and died in Fredericton, Saint John, or Moncton, \r\nor in or near a community with a daily newspaper, there is a good chance that \r\nhis or her death was noted in a column entitled simply &#8220;Died.&#8221;&#160; Death notices of \r\nthis sort served to inform the newspaper&#8217;s readership and those in their circle \r\nof acquaintance of wake and funeral arrangements. (For the Irish, particularly \r\nthe Catholic Irish, wakes have always been major social occasions. &#160;In fact, in \r\npast generations, countless couples met and began courting at wakes.) \r\n&#160;Nineteenth-century New Brunswick death notices frequently recorded the place of \r\nbirth of the deceased, even when almost nothing else was noted. &#160;For instance, \r\non June 11, 1902, readers of the <em>Saint John Globe</em> read of the death of \r\n&#8220;James Murphy, 92, a native of County Louth, Ireland, survived by eight \r\nchildren.&#8221; &#160;I am convinced that the death notices of immigrants who came to New \r\nBrunswick as part of a chain of settlers from a single old-country parish were \r\nmore likely to contain a reference to that birthplace than those of &#8220;lonely&#8221; \r\nimmigrants.&#160; That even the briefest of death notices often refer to the \r\ndeceased&#8217;s county or parish of birth reveals a great deal about how our \r\nancestors viewed themselves. &#160;A quick visit to the Provincial Archives of New \r\nBrunswick&#8217;s website [<strong>http://archives.gnb.ca]</strong> will give the \r\nresearcher access to an enormous collection of vital records transcribed from \r\nNew Brunswick newspapers by the late Danny Johnson.</p>\r\n<p><strong>II. Tombstone Inscriptions: </strong></p>\r\n<p>Places of origin in Ireland &#8212; or for that matter, in Scotland, England, or in \r\nany of the &#8220;old countries&#8221; that peopled New Brunswick &#8212; are frequently noted on \r\ntombstones.&#160; Tombstones in many of the Province&#8217;s older cemeteries have been \r\ntranscribed for posterity by genealogical enthusiasts who have braved inclement \r\nweather, barbed wire, and mosquitoes to achieve their ends. &#160;Many of these \r\ntranscriptions have been deposited with the Provincial Archives in Fredericton \r\nand with the local library.&#160; A word of caution: if at all possible, it is best \r\nfor the researcher to inspect a tombstone of interest him or herself. &#160;Tombstone \r\ntranscription can be a daunting task; monuments are often partially or entirely \r\nillegible, and more than one transcriber has exercised a greater than \r\nappropriate amount of creativity in his work.&#160; In general, tombstones are \r\ncounted among the least accurate of genealogical sources.&#160; They are often \r\nerected many years after the death of the individual or individuals they \r\ncommemorate, and, therefore, after memories have faded.</p>\r\n<p><strong>III.</strong><strong> Land</strong><strong> Petitions:</strong></p>\r\n<p>If the subject of your research settled in rural New Brunswick before 1860, \r\nthere is a good chance that he applied for a land grant. &#160;Applications for land \r\nfiled before 1830, in particular, tended to provide an exhilarating amount of \r\ndetail about the applicant: age, marital status, number of children, length of \r\nresidence in the Province and, very frequently, county of birth in Ireland. &#160;New \r\nBrunswick Land Petitions can be searched at the Provincial Archives in \r\nFredericton or at the Saint John Regional Library (with a complete <em>index \r\n</em>of more than 67,000 petitions available on the PANB website: <strong><a href=\"http://http//archives.gnb.ca\" target=\"_blank\">http://archives.gnb.ca</a></strong>).</p>\r\n<p><strong>IV. Church Records:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>A.</strong> If the subject of your search was Catholic and resided in \r\nan area currently embraced by the Diocese of Saint John, your search for Irish \r\norigins should begin at the Diocesan Archives at 1 Bayard Drive in Saint John.&#160; \r\nSince the mid 1980&#8217;s, Diocesan Archivist Mary Kilfoil McDevitt has transcribed \r\nnearly all the Archives&#8217; pre-1900 baptismal, marriage and burial records onto \r\nhundreds of thousands of family group sheets. &#160;These records are meticulously \r\norganized, indexed, and cross-referenced by maiden surname of mother so that \r\nthey are easily accessible to even the novice researcher. &#160;(N.B. Even if your \r\nancestor&#8217;s group sheet is silent as to his birthplace, it is frequently possible \r\nto infer a great deal on this question by consulting the group sheets of those \r\nwho stood as sponsors for his or her children.) Mrs. McDevitt can be contacted \r\nat: The Diocesan Archives, 1 Bayard Drive, Saint John, NB E2L 3L5 (506) \r\n653-6807.</p>\r\n<p>Those interested in Irish Catholic families who settled in other parts of the \r\nprovince, specifically in predominantly Acadian regions, are often pleasantly \r\nsurprised to find that an amazing amount of detail was recorded at the time of \r\ntheir ancestor&#8217;s marriage, frequently including an exact place of birth in \r\nIreland.&#160; By the time the Irish began to arrive in New Brunswick in large \r\nnumbers, the Acadian population had intermarried to the point that almost every \r\nmarriage required some form of dispensation from church law.&#160; In this case, a \r\nunique system of record keeping was necessitated, a system which detailed the \r\nspecifics of parentage and birthplace and which far exceeded the registration \r\nrequirements of the universal church. &#160;Many a Saint John or Kings County \r\nresearcher &#8212; exasperated after years of futile searching for his ancestor&#8217;s \r\nplace of origin in Ireland &#8212; has been left asking, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t <em>my</em> Irish \r\nancestors settle in Westmorland [or Gloucester, etc.] County?&#8221; </p>\r\n<p><strong>B.</strong> For reasons which far transcend the scope of this \r\narticle, the records of the various Protestant denominations are far less useful \r\nthan those of the Catholic Church in determining the Irish birthplaces of \r\ncongregants. &#160;There are exceptions, however.&#160; For example: Anglican and \r\nMethodist burial registers sometimes note the old-country birthplace of an \r\nindividual brought for burial. &#160;And, if you are determined to identify a place \r\nof origin in Ireland, it is best to consult any and all sources which might \r\ncontain references to your subject.&#160; The record keeping requirements of many \r\ndenominations appear to have been determined at the congregational level. \r\n&#160;Occasionally, a researcher has been surprised to find an invaluable marginal \r\nnotation on the baptismal, marriage, or burial entry of an ancestor occasioned \r\nby little more than the musings of a distracted record keeper.</p>\r\n<p><strong>V. &#8220;Missing Friends&#8221;:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Sometimes we tend to forget that our immigrant ancestors &#8212; much like \r\nourselves &#8212; were, in their day, part of a complex web of kinship: they all had \r\nparents, most had siblings, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, and cousins&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;. . \r\n. and friends.&#160; Some of these remained in Ireland; others went abroad, to places \r\nas far-flung as Australia and New Zealand. &#160;With some, contact was maintained.&#160; \r\nWith others, contact was severed &#8212; either temporarily or permanently.&#160; Beginning \r\nin 1831 and for the next eighty-five years, the <em>Boston</em><em> Pilot &#8212; \r\n</em>a Catholic weekly with wide circulation &#8212; carried more than 45,000 &#8220;Missing \r\nFriends&#8221; advertisements placed by friends and relatives in search of loved ones. \r\n&#160;Many of these ads contain references to individuals who either passed through \r\nor settled in New Brunswick. &#160;No one knows exactly how many New Brunswick \r\nimmigrants were reunited with family or friends as a result of the notices, but, \r\nwhatever that figure, these nineteenth-century ads have helped and continue to \r\nhelp many of our contemporaries find their ancestors. &#160;Search for your missing \r\nfriend (or relative) at: </p>\r\n<p><strong>http://www.newenglandancestors.org/database_search/MissingFriends_VOL1-8.asp</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong><strong>VI. Online Sources: </strong></p>\r\n<p>In recent years, internet genealogy has become a wildly popular phenomenon.&#160; \r\nNew genealogical sources appear online on a daily basis.&#160; Keeping up with them \r\ncould constitute a full-time job! &#160;Nonetheless, anyone attempting with \r\ndifficulty to identify the specific place of origin of an Irish immigrant should \r\nvisit <a href=\"http://www.failteromhat.com/griffiths.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.failteromhat.com/griffiths.htm</a>,&#160;where, at the push \r\nof a button, it is possible to search one of the only extant &#8220;all Ireland&#8221; \r\nsources: The Primary Valuation of Ireland.&#160; Compiled between 1848 and 1864, this \r\nsurvey of Irish land ownership and occupancy became known as &#8220;Griffith&#8217;s \r\nValuation,&#8221; after Richard Griffith, the director of Ireland&#8217;s Valuation Office \r\nat the time. &#160;Even if your ancestor left Ireland in 1820, reference to \r\n&#8220;Griffith&#8217;s Valuation&#8221; may be helpful in determining the distribution of his/her \r\nsurname nationally or within a particular county or parish.&#160; Be forewarned: If \r\nyou are attempting to identify the specific place of origin of your Irish-born \r\nancestor, John Murphy, Griffith&#8217;s will be of little practical help.&#160; Perhaps, \r\nhowever, your ancestor had a somewhat unusual surname or Christian name/surname \r\ncombination (or was married, in Ireland, to someone with an unusual surname).&#160; \r\nReferring to &#8220;Griffith&#8217;s&#8221; might help you to locate a distant, or not-so-distant, \r\nkinsman with the same name, thereby narrowing your search for a specific place \r\nof origin. Overwhelmed by the online possibilities?&#160; Try accessing <a href=\"http://www.cyndislist.com/ireland.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cyndislist.com/ireland.htm</a>. for a growing \r\ncollection of Irish resources. And, when all else fails, try <em>googling</em> \r\nyour ancestor.&#160; Be sure to put his/her name in quotation marks and then to \r\ninclude any key words (i.e. Tipperary). Sometimes it <em>is</em> possible to \r\nfind that needle in the &#8220;haystack&#8221; of cyberspace.</p>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/identifying-the-old-country-origins-of-your-new-brunswick-irish-ancestor/", "published": "December 4, 2008", "id": 10}, {"author": "Michael J.

The National Archives of Canada and the National \r\nLibrary of Canada recently announced the creation of the Canadian Genealogy \r\nCentre. These two organizations, in partnership with the Canadian Culture Online \r\nprogram of the Department of Canadian Heritage, have created a new website for \r\nthose researching their ancestors. The website is available at <a href=\"http://www.genealogy.gc.ca/\" target=\"new\">http://www.genealogy.gc.ca/</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>According to the site, the purpose of the Canadian Genealogy Centre is to act \r\nas a single portal for electronic access to genealogical resources in Canada. \r\nThe mission and vision statement of the center is as follows: </p>\r\n<p>Facilitate the<strong> discovery</strong> of our roots and family histories as a basic \r\npart of our Canadian heritage.<br><br>Encourage the use of genealogy and the \r\nresources available in libraries and archives as tools for<strong> life-long \r\nlearning</strong>. </p>\r\n<p>The site is divided into ten different sections: The Centre; What&#8217;s New; \r\nSurveys; Discussion; Boutique; Genealogical Research; How to; Links: Partners; \r\nand Educational Resources. Throughout this easy-to-navigate site are \r\nillustrations culled from the collections of the National Archives as well as \r\nindividuals and other organizations. There is a site search as well as online \r\nhelp. As with all government websites in Canada it is available in both and \r\nEnglish and a French version. Not all of the information in the databases is \r\nfully bilingual however.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Centre</strong><strong> </strong>section shows visitors the \r\npurpose and mission statement of the Centre and a description of the overall \r\nactivities of the site. The Centre works with a network of organizations to \r\nprovide assistance to genealogical researchers. In addition to genealogy groups, \r\nparticipating organizations include libraries, universities, private firms, and \r\nvolunteers. The Centre holds partnering organizations to certain standards when \r\nproviding information for the site, ensuring that materials provided will be of \r\nthe highest quality. Among the partnering organizations are the Jewish \r\nGenealogical Society of Montreal and the Jewish Genealogical Society of Ottawa. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Those who are just starting to research their Canadian ancestors can benefit \r\nfrom the <strong>How To</strong> section. It is separated into six areas \r\nintended as a step-by-step introduction to research: Introduction, Gathering \r\nInformation, Let&#8217;s Go to Work!, Sources, Guides, and Courses. The introduction \r\nis a simplistic explanation of the concepts of tracing ancestors, tracing \r\ndescendants, and family history. Gathering Information gives suggestions for \r\nwhere to look for information, focusing primarily on home sources but also \r\nstressing the importance of other sources such as directories and local \r\nhistories. Mention is also made of the necessity to be proficient in geography \r\nto make research easier.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s Go to Work</strong> urges beginning genealogists to start their \r\nresearch at genealogical societies and libraries rather than the Internet. Links \r\nare given to the Canadian Library Gateway (http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/gatepasse/) and \r\nthe Canadian Council of Archives (http://www.cdncouncilarchives.ca/) to find \r\nadditional information on manuals, guides, newsletters, journals, etc. </p>\r\n<p>The <strong>Sources</strong> area contains brief descriptions of the major \r\ntypes of sources used by genealogists: census records, vital records, land \r\nrecords, estate records, military records, immigration, citizenship, justice, \r\nnotarial records, newspapers, and cemeteries. Sample images are provided for \r\neach type of source. An additional area contains links to information on each \r\nprovince or territory, which include brief histories and suggestions for \r\nresearching in other repositories, such as the various provincial archives.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Guides</strong> list two booklets available for the researcher: The \r\nNational Archives of Canada pamphlet <em>Tracing Your Ancestors in Canada</em> and \r\nthe National Library of Canada&#8217;s <em>Genealogy and Family History at the National \r\nLibrary of Canada</em>. There are links to online versions of these works. </p>\r\n<p>The <strong>Courses</strong> area notes that most genealogical societies \r\noffer some type of educational opportunities. It also names the National \r\nInstitute for Genealogical Studies as an excellent opportunity for learning. \r\nNIGS is affiliated with the University of Toronto.</p>\r\n<p>The largest section, and the one with the most obvious appeal to family \r\nhistorians, is the <strong>Genealogical Research</strong> section. There are \r\ncurrently five databases on the site &#8212; two of these contain searchable data on \r\nancestors, while the other three are catalogs. The two searchable databases are \r\n&#8220;1915&#8211;1932 Canadian naturalization&#8221; and &#8220;Immigrants at Grosse-&#238;le.&#8221; The first \r\nwas produced with the Jewish Genealogical Society of Montreal and the Jewish \r\nGenealogical Society of Ottawa. It contains naturalized immigrants whose names \r\nwere published in the <em>Canada Gazette</em> between 1915 and 1932. The second \r\ndatabase contains information about immigrants who stayed at the Grosse-&#206;le \r\nQuarantine Station between 1832 and 1937. This data is derived from nine \r\ndifferent sources: List of Major Denis Mahon&#8217;s sharecroppers; Births at sea; \r\nDeaths at sea; Hospital Registers; Baptisms at Grosse-&#238;le; Marriages at \r\nGrosse-&#238;le; Burials at Grosse-&#238;le; Memorial; and Inventory of the personal \r\nbelongings of deceased immigrants. </p>\r\n<p>Both databases are documented exceedingly well. There is much explanatory \r\ntext showing the nature of the database, sources of the original materials, \r\nwhere to find the original materials, how to search, how to interpret results, \r\netc. It is rare to find such well thought out documentation and assistance for \r\nonline databases. </p>\r\n<p>One improvement that could be made to this excellent documentation would be \r\nto provide information to users on how to cite the database in their research as \r\na source, such as one can find on the <em>NewEnglandAncestors.org</em> and \r\n<em>Ancestry.com</em> databases. It would also be beneficial if one could search \r\nboth databases at the same time, instead of having to search them individually. \r\nAs there are currently only two databases, this is not a major issue at the \r\npresent time, but as the site continues to grow it will prove cumbersome to \r\nusers if they must search each one on its own.</p>\r\n<p>The three catalog databases provide access to untold riches in repositories \r\nthroughout Canada. </p>\r\n<p>&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; AMICUS Web is the online catalog for the National Library of \r\nCanada<br>&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ArchiviaNet is the online catalog for the National Archives \r\nof Canada. <br>&#8226;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; CAIN is the online catalog for the Canadian Archival \r\nInformation Network, containing information from over 800 organizations \r\nthroughout the country. </p>\r\n<p>The Genealogical Research area is also home to the <strong>Directory of \r\nResources</strong>, an invaluable directory to hundreds of databases held by \r\norganizations throughout Canada. These databases were created by many \r\nindividuals and groups from genealogical and historical societies, colleges and \r\nuniversities, and other organizations of importance to genealogical research. \r\nThe directory can be searched or browsed. The listings contain the name of each \r\ndatabase and the organization affiliated with it. The directory also provides \r\ndetailed information about the database, links to each organization or \r\nindividual, and direct links to those databases searchable via the Internet are \r\nalso available. This is one of the largest collections of links to Canadian \r\ngenealogical databases available anywhere, and completely searchable by subject, \r\nlocality, etc.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>What&#8217;s New</strong> section is divided into two areas. The first \r\ncontains news about the Centre and its activities, as well as an archive of \r\npress releases from the organization. The second area lists conferences of \r\ninterest to the genealogical community in Canada. </p>\r\n<p>The <strong>Educational Resources</strong> section is geared to assisting \r\neducators in teaching genealogy. While still under development, it already \r\ncontains two very valuable areas. The first is a glossary of genealogical terms. \r\nThe glossary contains a large number of basic terms necessary for those new to \r\ngenealogy (such as genealogy, given name, maiden name, heraldic symbols, and \r\nhereditary), but it is missing basic terms such as pedigree, pedigree chart, \r\nfamily group sheet, and ahnentafel that everyone doing genealogical research \r\nshould know from the very beginning. </p>\r\n<p>The other area under Educational Resources contains a complete teaching \r\ncurriculum for the third and fourth grades. The team that developed the lesson \r\nplan took into account curricula requirements for all of the provinces in \r\ndeveloping the plan. The plan is focused around photographs and oral history \r\ninterviews. There is a fourteen-page handout for students with an adorable \r\ncartoon character named EuGENEus &#8211; the Galactic Genealogical Genius &#8211; to act as \r\na guide to learning basic steps in genealogy. There is an interactive online \r\nactivity to help students create their own timeline as well as an online quiz to \r\nhelp students measure their learning. A full evaluation matrix for grading is \r\nincluded as well. </p>\r\n<p><strong>The Boutique</strong> section includes links to two online stores \r\nwith materials useful to genealogists: that of The Friends of the National \r\nGenealogical Society and The Ontario Genealogical Society, Ottawa Branch. The \r\nCentre is actively soliciting suggestions for other materials that can be added \r\nto this section. </p>\r\n<p>The Surveys and Discussion sections are still under construction, but plans \r\nare underway to utilize these sections to solicit feedback from users and to \r\nfacilitate communication between genealogists researching their Canadian \r\nancestors.</p>\r\n<p>All in all, this is one of the most valuable websites available for Canadian \r\ngenealogical research. The partnership between the government and private \r\norganizations is a refreshing combination, and one that appears to be working \r\nquite successfully. It is certainly making great strides towards its goal of \r\nbeing a single-window portal for genealogists. Check back often to see the new \r\nadditions and upgrades to the site. This is definitely a website to \r\nbookmark!</p>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/introducing-the-canadian-genealogy-centre/", "published": "October 10, 2003", "id": 11}, {"author": "Michael J. Leclerc", "country": "Canada", "title": "Introduction to French-Canadian Research", "content": "<p>French-Canadians and their Franco-American descendants interested in \r\ngenealogy are very lucky indeed. The records of Qu&#233;bec are among the best in the \r\nworld. With the exception of minor rebellions, no major war has been fought on \r\nQu&#233;bec soil since the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in the mid-eighteenth \r\ncentury. Because of diligent reporting practices, most parish registers have \r\nsurvived. And major genealogical research has been conducted for over a \r\ncentury.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Vital Records</strong><br>Civil registration of vital records in the province \r\nof Qu&#233;bec did not begin until 1994. Prior to that time, the churches were \r\nrequired to keep duplicate copies of their registers and send them to the civil \r\nauthorities as the official record of births, marriages, and deaths in the \r\nprovince. The Catholic Church was the first denomination to record these events. \r\nAfter the English took control of Canada, other denominations were added \r\nincrementally starting with the Anglican Church. The great majority of \r\nFrench-Canadians, however, were Catholic.</p>\r\n<p>While these records were supposed to be indexed every year, not every parish \r\nfollowed this procedure. Some of the indexes were prepared in order by page \r\nnumber, rather than alphabetically. Thus it is necessary to go through the \r\nentire index name by name to find individuals you are looking for. Page numbers \r\nin Qu&#233;bec refer to the front and back of a page, rather than facing pages as \r\nthey might in the United States. When scrolling through microfilm images, you \r\nwill often need to look at two consecutive images to view the entire page. </p>\r\n<p>Qu&#233;becois naming patterns are important in utilizing these records. Men were \r\noften baptized as Joseph and women as Marie. In addition, French-Canadian women \r\nby tradition kept their maiden names throughout their lives. Even on their death \r\nrecords, women were recorded by the name they carried at birth.</p>\r\n<p>The copy of the parish registers that the churches sent to the provincial \r\ngovernment is known as the <em>Registre d'&#201;tat Civile</em>. Those registers prior \r\nto 1900 are available at the branches of the Archives Nationales de Qu&#233;bec or at \r\nthe Family History Library in Salt Lake City (and also, of course, through your \r\nlocal Family History Center or NEHGS). </p>\r\n<p>It is important when you are researching in microfilms of parish registers to \r\nnote whether you are looking at the original parish register or the <em>Registre \r\nd'&#201;tat Civile</em>. The original parish records were kept for tracking sacraments \r\nin the Catholic Church, and nearly all followed the same format. The names of \r\nthe individuals were written on the left side of the page with the details of \r\nthe sacrament on the right, which again included the name of the individual. In \r\nthe margin under the person's name are often notes written by the parish priest. \r\nThese marginal notes can contain extremely valuable information for your \r\nresearch. For example, a marginal note recorded prior to my grandmother's \r\nbaptismal record in the parish of St. Norbert d'Arthabaska stated that the \r\ninfant's grandmother, my great-great grandmother, was at Sanford, Maine. This \r\nwas the first indication in the history of my research that placed her at \r\nSanford, and it allowed me to find a marriage record that had eluded me for over \r\nseven years! These marginal notes, which are in the original parish registers, \r\nare only rarely transferred to the <em>Registre d'&#201;tat Civile</em>. </p>\r\n<p><strong>The Drouin Institute</strong><br>The <a href=\"http://drouininstitute.com/index_en.html\" target=\"_new\">Drouin Institute</a> \r\nin Montr&#233;al began conducting genealogical research in 1899 and continued \r\ncollecting, transcribing, and selling records and family genealogies for many \r\nyears. In the 1940s they microfilmed the registers of every parish in the \r\nprovince, whether Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish. The Drouin Institute folded \r\nin the late 1990s and their holdings were sold to the <a href=\"http://www.afgs.org/\" target=\"_new\">American-French Genealogical Society</a> \r\nin Woonsocket, Rhode Island. In 1999, AFGS agreed to sell copies of these \r\nmicrofilms to NEHGS, and they remain the only two repositories in the United \r\nStates where the entire collection is available.</p>\r\n<p>After microfilming of the parish registers was completed, the Drouin \r\nInstitute abstracted the marriage records from all of the Catholic churches. \r\nThese records include the names of the individuals who were to be married, as \r\nwell as the names of their parents. If one of the parties was married \r\npreviously, the name of the previous spouse appears instead of the names of the \r\nparents. Drouin created two master indexes of marriages; one by groom and one by \r\nbride. They are indexed by surname, then by first name, then by surname of \r\nspouse. The names of the parents and/or previous spouse, and the date and place \r\nof marriage are also included in the index. These indexes are in three series \r\nand cover the period 1608-1930. The first series covers 1608-1760 and is \r\navailable in book form. The second series covers 1760-1880, and the third \r\n1881-1930. These are now available on microfilm in the NEHGS microtext \r\ndepartment. </p>\r\n<p><strong>P&#233;re Cyprien Tanguay and the <em>Dictionnaire G&#233;n&#233;alogique des Familles \r\nCanadiennes depuis la Fondation de la Colonie Jusqu'&#224; nos \r\nJours</em></strong><br>Father Tanguay (1819-1902) was a Catholic priest who studied \r\nthe parish records of early families in Qu&#233;bec. He compiled genealogies of the \r\nearly families through the mid-eighteenth century. He published the first volume \r\nof <em>Dictionnaire G&#233;n&#233;alogique des Familles Canadiennes depuis la Fondation de \r\nla Colonie Jusqu'&#224; nos Jours</em> in 1871, and published six additional volumes \r\nover the next twenty years.<br><br>Father Tanguay's work separates individuals \r\nby generation into family groups. The information includes dates and places of \r\nmarriage as well as names of children, including their dates and places of birth \r\nand baptism. The families are in alphabetical order by surname of the \r\nhusband/father. Because there may be more than one individual with the same name \r\nin the same generation, it is often necessary to scrutinize the entries of \r\nseveral families before finding the correct ones.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to these several volumes, Arthur LeBeouf published a volume of \r\nadditions and corrections to Tanguay in his <em>Compl&#233;ment au Dictionnaire \r\nG&#233;n&#233;alogique Tanguay</em> (1957). In addition to re-examining the parish records \r\npublished by Tanguay, LeBeouf researched additional sources to supplement the \r\noriginal work.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ren&#233; Jett&#233; and the Programme de R&#233;cherche en Demographie \r\nHistorique</strong><br>Ren&#233; Jett&#233; is often considered the father of modern \r\nFrench-Canadian genealogy. With a grant from the Qu&#233;bec government, this \r\nprofessor at the University of Montr&#233;al started the Programme de R&#233;cherche in \r\nDemographie Historique (PRDH). The PRDH examined original parish registers, \r\nearly census records, hospital records, abjuration records, marriage contracts, \r\nand other records to create a picture of the early immigrants of New France.</p>\r\n<p>Over the course of time, the PRDH published abstracts of these records in a \r\nseries of volumes covering the years 1608-1765. These books are separated into \r\ndifferent time periods and the records of each place examined are kept together \r\nand indexed individually. There is also a master index for each time period. In \r\n1999, the PRDH published a CD-ROM covering the time period 1766-1799, and \r\nsubsequently released a second CD-ROM containing all of the earlier materials. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>In 1983, Jett&#233; published the most important book in French-Canadian \r\ngenealogical research since Tanguay's work a century earlier. The \r\n<em>Dictionnaire g&#233;n&#233;alogique des familles du Qu&#233;bec des origines &#224; 1730</em>, \r\npublished by the University of Montr&#233;al, contains biographies of all families in \r\nNew France through about 1730. In addition to the primary sources mentioned \r\nabove, Jett&#233; utilized over thirty previously published works to add to the \r\nbiographies. The work is published entirely in French, but most records are very \r\neasily translated. Jett&#233; also suggests over a hundred other secondary sources to \r\nuse for additional research.</p>\r\n<p>These are the basics you will need to begin researching your French-Canadian \r\nancestors. While many of the sources are in French, most can be translated with \r\nlittle difficulty. Once you have started and get used to the intricacies of the \r\nvarious resources, you should easily be able to work your way through them.</p>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/introduction-to-french-canadian-research/", "published": "February 1, 2002", "id": 12}, {"author": "Michael J.

During the battle for independence, many individuals \r\nremained loyal to the British crown. After the war was over and Britain \r\nceded to the thirteen colonies their independence, these individuals \r\nwere faced with a choice.</p>\r\n<p>Remaining in the colonies would prove difficult in many areas. They \r\nwould be open to persecution for their support of the losing side during\r\n the war. Many had already lost their land and possessions during the \r\nvarious battles and other events of the war. These unsettling conditions\r\n would be the same for both those who actually fought in battle and \r\nprivate citizens who merely supported the effort. Britain provided \r\nstrong incentive for these individuals to move to Canada by offering \r\nland and other enticements. These incentives proved very successful, and\r\n thousands of families moved north for a new start. </p>\r\n<p>In addition to those who moved north for their political views, there\r\n were many who settled there for other reasons. Many who at least paid \r\nnominal tribute to the Crown relocated because they felt there would be \r\nbetter opportunities for them there than in the fledgling United States.\r\n </p>\r\n<p>At the time, the area north of the thirteen American colonies was \r\ndivided into two parts: the colony of Qu&#233;bec and the colony of Nova \r\nScotia. Nova Scotia consisted of the Isle of St. John (now Prince Edward\r\n Island), Cape Breton, the Nova Scotia peninsula, and the part of the \r\nmainland that is now the province of New Brunswick. The colony of Qu&#233;bec\r\n contained the lands north and west of Nova Scotia and north of the \r\nnewly formed United States. The actual boundaries of these territories \r\nwould not be settled for decades, often making it difficult to conduct \r\nresearch in the areas in the immediate vicinity of the border. </p>\r\n<p>Prior to the Revolution there were three major townships in the north\r\n of the area that is today New Brunswick. Cumberland and Sackville were \r\nlocated on the Bay of Fundy, while Maugerville was on the St. John \r\nRiver. To the south were the smaller settlements of Hopewell, \r\nHillsborough, and Monckton, as well as the Memramcook district. The sum \r\ntotal of population for these areas prior to the arrival of the \r\nLoyalists was about 1,500. </p>\r\n<p>It is estimated that about 28,000 Loyalists (including men, women, \r\nand children) settled in the old province of Nova Scotia after the \r\nRevolution. Of these, about 14,500 came to the area around the Bay of \r\nFundy that is today New Brunswick. In her 1955 work <em>The Loyalists of \r\nNew Brunswick</em> (Fredericton, 1955), Esther Clark Wright provides a \r\ngreat deal of information on these individuals. It is one of the most \r\ndetailed studies of Loyalist settlers in Canada available. </p>\r\n<p>Wright studied the names of the individual families and was able to \r\ndetermine their origins as follows: </p>\r\n<table width=\"378\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><p>Percentage</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"252\" valign=\"top\"><p>Colony of Origin </p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><p>40%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"252\" valign=\"top\"><p>New York </p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><p>22%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"252\" valign=\"top\"><p>New Jersey </p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><p>12.9%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"252\" valign=\"top\"><p>Connecticut</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><p>7.7%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"252\" valign=\"top\"><p>Pennsylvania</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><p>6.1%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"252\" valign=\"top\"><p>Massachusetts</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><p>2.3%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"252\" valign=\"top\"><p>Maryland</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><p>1.9%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"252\" valign=\"top\"><p>Rhode Island </p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><p>1.6%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"252\" valign=\"top\"><p>North Carolina </p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><p>1.5%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"252\" valign=\"top\"><p>South Carolina </p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><p>1.2%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"252\" valign=\"top\"><p>New Hampshire </p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><p>1%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"252\" valign=\"top\"><p>Virginia</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><p>.3%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"252\" valign=\"top\"><p>Delaware</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"126\" valign=\"top\"><p>.3%</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"252\" valign=\"top\"><p>Georgia</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Most of these people came from families that had been established in \r\nthe American colonies for several generations. [i] </p>\r\n<p>Wright was also able to crush the long-standing myth that all \r\nLoyalists belonged to upper class and merchant families. By studying \r\nadmittance records and other lists, she was able to determine that the \r\nvast majority of these individuals practiced the trades of the working \r\nclass: yeomen (farmers), carpenters, cordwainers, tailors, blacksmiths, \r\nmariners, shipwrights, etc. While there were a few members of the higher\r\n classes in each settlement, the vast majority of individuals were \r\naverage colonists. [ii] </p>\r\n<p>Tensions began to develop between the settlers in the western part of\r\n the province and those on the peninsula. Many of the Loyalists were \r\ndesirous of forming their own government and creating a new province. On\r\n May 29, 1784, notice was given that the king had granted the partition \r\nof the colony. The peninsula, Cape Breton Island, and the Island of St. \r\nJohn would remain Nova Scotia while the western part would form the new \r\nprovince of New Brunswick. </p>\r\n<p>Wright&#8217;s book provides great detail on these refugees to a new \r\nterritory. She also includes one of the most comprehensive lists of \r\nnames of New Brunswick Loyalists available, which also gives information\r\n on their military and political connections. </p>\r\n<p>Marion Gilroy compiled a list of Loyalists residing in the new \r\nprovince of Nova Scotia in <em>Loyalists and Land Settlement in Nova \r\nScotia</em>&#160; (Public Archives of Nova Scotia Publication No. 4, Halifax, \r\n1937). Her information came from land grants, warrants, escheats, and \r\nother records in several branches of provincial government. Broken down \r\ncounty by county, she abstracted information from over 8,200 land \r\ntransactions dealing with the Loyalists. </p>\r\n<p>We now turn to the western province of Qu&#233;bec. This territory had \r\nonly been conveyed to Great Britain in 1763. Now, two decades later, it \r\nwould prove a haven for thousands of Loyalist families from New York and\r\n New England. The towns of Sorel, Chambly, and St. John&#8217;s on the \r\nsouthern side of the St. Lawrence River (between Montr&#233;al, New York, and\r\n Vermont) were initial magnets for settlers. Another area of vast \r\ninterest was the western side of Mississquoi Bay containing Foucault (or\r\n Caldwell&#8217;s Manor) and Noyan (or Christie&#8217;s Manor), slightly to the \r\nnorth of it. These areas were very fertile with lots of woodland. </p>\r\n<p>Although initially opposed to communities located too close to the \r\nborder with the United States, the provincial government eventually \r\nrelented and allowed such settlements. Over time they spread eastward \r\nfor more than fifty miles into the present-day counties of Missisquoi, \r\nBrome, Shefford, Stanstead, and Sherbrooke. This area is known as the \r\nEaster Townships. </p>\r\n<p>So many Loyalists had flooded into Qu&#233;bec that by 1791 the English \r\npopulation had grown to about 20,000. [iii] This sudden influx put even \r\nmore stress on an already strained political situation. In 1791 the \r\nConstitution Act was passed to separate Qu&#233;bec into two provinces: Upper\r\n Canada and Lower Canada. The territory to the west, Upper Canada, was \r\nprimarily filled with Loyalist settlements. To the east, Lower Canada \r\ncontained most of the original settlements of the province of Qu&#233;bec. It\r\n was allowed to retain law under the Paris custom in order to appease \r\nthe French -speaking residents and hopefully prevent another military \r\ncrisis in North America. </p>\r\n<p>Many individuals filed petitions with the provincial government to \r\nget land in compensation for their losses during the war. Petitions \r\nsubmitted to the Land Committee of the Executive Council in Qu&#233;bec and \r\nLower Canada between 1764 and 1841 have been organized and microfilmed \r\nand are available at NEHGS and the Archives Nationales de Qu&#233;bec. These \r\ndocuments include many reports, schedules, minutes, and testimony for \r\nLoyalists settling in the province. </p>\r\n<p>In 1904 the Bureau of Archives in Ontario published a two-volume set \r\nof materials in their collections pertaining to the Loyalists. They \r\ncontain information on thousands of individuals who settled throughout \r\nCanada in the post-war years. Vast amounts of genealogical data are \r\navailable in these records. Here is one example of testimony, from the \r\ncase of Mary Browster, late of Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. She swore the \r\nfollowing statements to be correct: </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Says she lived at Niagara in 1783. Her late Husband, Joseph Browster \r\nwas a native of Ireland, &amp; was settled in America many years before \r\nthe rebellion broke out. </p>\r\n<p>In 1775 he lived in Westmoreland, Pennsylvania, and was always a \r\nfriend of Gt. Britain. In Septr., 1780, he set out to get into Detroit \r\nbut was killed by the Indian who had undertaken to be his guide. She \r\ncame to Detroit in 1782 with their children. She lived ther until 1783, \r\nafter which she lived a year at Niagara &amp; from thence to Sorel where\r\n she now resides. She has 3 children with her, viz., Margt, 12 years \r\nold; 2<sup>nd</sup>, Simon, ten years; 3<sup>rd</sup>, Martha, 6 years \r\nold&#8230;. [iv] </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Descendants of the Loyalists are eligible for membership in the \r\nUnited Empire Loyalists&#8217; Association in Canada. This organization \r\nprovides education, programs, publications, and other activities \r\npertaining to the Loyalists.

The \r\nfirst decennial census for Canada was taken in 1871, four years after the \r\nConfederation. Prior to that year the provincial government was responsible for \r\nthe taking of censuses. The 1861 Nova Scotia census is the earliest complete \r\ncensus of the province to survive. The National Archives of Canada borrowed \r\ncopies of provincial censuses to add to the post&#8211;Confederation materials to put \r\ntogether the most complete collection of censuses for Canada. NEHGS has copies \r\nof the NAC microfilms for the entire country [HA741/C4]. \r\n<p>In 1987 the NAC published a finding aid for these materials, <em>Catalogue of \r\nCensus Returns on Microfilm</em> (Ottawa, ON: Public Archives of Canada, 1987) \r\n[Microtext HA742/P82/1987]. The guide covers the surviving censuses through 1891 \r\nand is divided into the separate provinces. Each province lists the districts \r\nand sub-districts in alphabetical order. The districts are roughly analogous to \r\ncounties, while the sub-districts are analogous to town boundaries (or ward \r\nboundaries in cities). Each district and sub-district lists the year for which a \r\ncensus survives for that area, and gives the National Archives reel number on \r\nwhich it may be found. </p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, this guide does not list all surviving census returns. There \r\nare a large number of census fragments, householder lists, and other \r\ncensus&#8211;related resources which are contained on the microfilms, but not included \r\nin the catalog. The National Archives of Canada has a special finding aid, \r\nFinding Aid 300, which should be consulted for additional information about \r\nthese census fragments. Copies of this finding aid can be ordered from them. \r\nVisit their <a href=\"http://www.archives.ca/08/08_e.html\">website</a> for more \r\ninformation.</p>\r\n<p>Canadian census materials are not available for loan through the NEHGS \r\nCirculating Library. There are, however, two ways to obtain microfilms in your \r\narea. Films can be rented through the Family History Library system and brought \r\nto your local Family History Center. See their <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\">website</a> for more details. In addition, \r\nthe National Archives of Canada circulates copies of these microfilms through \r\ninterlibrary loan. Contact your local public library for details on how to \r\nborrow these films. (Interlibrary loan works only between institutions. It is \r\nnot possible for individuals to borrow films directly from the National \r\nArchives.).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Church Records<br></strong>Because of the lack of early vital records in Nova \r\nScotia, church records of baptisms and burials are often the closest estimation \r\nof birth and death dates.

Two reels contain transcriptions of over a dozen of the \r\ncounty's cemeteries [CS88/N641/S531]. There is a reel filmed by the Provincial \r\nArchives of Nova Scotia (PANS) containing six volumes of early county records \r\n[CS88/N641/S35]. These records include lists created circa 1784 of town lots and \r\nwater lots; an alphabetical record of Shelburne settlers from the same time \r\nperiod; a grant book covering 1784 to 1787; a book of log marks from 1904 to \r\n1956; and a deed index for 1874 through 1876. Log marks are similar to cattle \r\nmarks and were used to prove ownership of logs as they were sent to sawmills. If \r\nyour ancestor was involved in the lumber trade in Shelburne County they will \r\nprove interesting to look at. </p>\r\n<p>At one time PANS borrowed and microfilmed a private collection containing a \r\ngreat deal of information on families in the area. NEHGS has a copy of this film \r\n[CS88/N64/S53], which includes 496 handwritten charts of families, along with \r\ntwo indexes. The first index lists the names of those in the main families \r\ntreated. They include the Acker, Bower, Bruce, Cox, Crowell, Davis, Dexter, \r\nDoane, Firth, Goulden, Hamilton, Harris, Hewett, Hogg, Holden, Irwin, Johns, \r\nMcGill, McAlpine, McKay, MacKenzie, Muir, Nickerson, Perry, Ryer, Smith, Snow, \r\nSwansburg, and Thorburn families. The second indexes the miscellaneous people \r\nwho appear in the charts. </p>\r\n<strong>Newspapers</strong><p>Unfortunately the Society does not maintain a large collection of newspaper \r\nmaterials on microfilm. Due to the generosity of member Patricia Haynes, \r\nhowever, we are fortunate to have a copy of <em>The Casket</em> [CS88/N645/C37], a \r\nCatholic newspaper published in Antigonish for many years. In addition to the \r\ndaily news, there are thousands of announcements of marriages and deaths within \r\nits pages. These announcements are not limited to individuals in Antigonish, but \r\nmention individuals throughout the province as well as other locations more \r\nremoved. It is not indexed and must be searched issue by issue. NEHGS has over \r\neighty years of issues, from December 1860 through December \r\n1943.</p>\r\n<strong>Miscellaneous Documents</strong><p>There are many miscellaneous documents in the NEHGS materials as well. Some \r\nof these are hidden on microfilm reels with other materials. In order to ensure \r\nthat you find all of the available material, please search the \r\n<em>NewEnglandAncestors.org</em> <a href=\"http://library.nehgs.org/\">library \r\ncatalog</a> for the localities and subjects you are interested in. This will \r\nreveal many hidden sources to you.</p>\r\n<p>For example, at the end of one of the vital records microfilms are a series \r\nof miscellaneous documents [CS88/N64/N64 Reel 35]. One item included is an 1861 \r\ncompilation entitled <em>A Catalogue of Manuscript Documents between 1748 and \r\n1841 Collected and Arranged under the Direction of Thomas B. Sherns (?), \r\nCommissioner of Publications at Halifax, N.S. 1861</em>. This document sources \r\nmany original manuscripts that should currently be held at PANS. While much of \r\nthe material consists of correspondence between various civil and military \r\nofficials, there is a great deal of genealogical information hidden within these \r\ndocuments as well. For example, document number 66 is a letter dated March 12, \r\n1760, from Sir Jeffrey Amherst in New York to Governor Lawrence in Nova Scotia. \r\nIncluded in the letter was a list of officers who had been granted a leave of \r\nabsence &#8211; a potential source of information on your ancestors. </p>\r\n<p>Among the other treasures on this reel are several early passenger lists. \r\nSometimes, as in the case of the ship <em>Sarah</em>, which arrived in 1801, the \r\nlists have transcriptions. On this list one can find the following individuals \r\nlisted as coming from Kiltarlity:<br><br>Dond. McKenzie, farmer<br>Donald \r\nMcDonald, farmer<br>John McDonald, laborer<br>Rod McDonnell, laborer<br>Ann \r\nMcDonald, spinster; Cath. McDonald, spinster; Janet McDonale, spinster; John \r\nMcDonald, (2); a child</p>\r\n<p>One microfilm that is available through the Circulating Library contains the \r\n<em>Compiled Genealogical Materials of the Maritime Provinces &#8211; New England \r\nGenealogy Research Interest Group of the Orange County, California Genealogical \r\nSociety 1650 to 1995</em> [CS88/M35/N49/1997]. Fully indexed, this contains \r\nmanuscript materials collected by the interest group including notes, \r\nphotocopies, letters, pedigree charts, and family group sheets. The materials \r\ncover a wide geographic area, but the index makes it easy to search and find \r\npeople you are looking for. There are a large number of records for individuals \r\nfrom Nova Scotia within these materials.</p>\r\n<p>Also available through the Circulating Library is Fred E. Crowell&#8217;s master \r\nwork <em>New Englanders in Nova Scotia</em> [F1036.8/C78]. This is a microfilm \r\npublished by NEHGS in 1979 from a manuscript donated by Mr. Crowell.

Murphy", "country": "Canada", "title": "New Brunswick Repositories: Archives of the Diocese of Saint John", "content": "<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p>The Diocese of Saint John is the seventh oldest Roman Catholic \r\ndiocese in Canada. Established in 1842, the Diocese originally embraced \r\nthe entire province of New Brunswick and the Madawaska region of the \r\nadjacent State of Maine. Currently, the Diocese of Saint John serves New\r\n Brunswick&#8217;s eight predominantly English-speaking counties: Saint John, \r\nKings, Queens, Sunbury, York, Charlotte, Carleton and Northumberland.</p>\r\n<p>Largely as a result of the explosion of interest in genealogy at the \r\nend of the 1970s, Bishop Arthur J. Gilbert established the Diocesan \r\nArchives as a publicly-accessible research facility. Peter D. Murphy \r\nserved as the first Diocesan Archivist. The Archives&#8212;currently housed in\r\n the Diocesan Services Building in Uptown Saint John&#8212;house most of the \r\nextant PRE-1900 sacramental records <em>for the parishes and regions \r\ncurrently served by the Diocese</em>. Except for records of interment, \r\nall POST-1900 records must be obtained directly from the parish or \r\nmission in which the sacrament was administered. The oldest extant \r\nsacramental records are those of Bartibogue, on the Miramichi, which \r\nbegin in 1801. Baptismal and marriage records for the Saint John area \r\nbegin in 1812, for the Fredericton and Charlotte County areas in 1827, \r\nthe Woodstock region in 1842, and the missions of Kings County in 1845.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Family Group Sheets<br></strong><br>Over the course of more \r\nthan twenty years, Diocesan Archivist, Mary Kilfoil McDevitt, has \r\npainstakingly transcribed virtually all pre 1900 sacramental records \r\nonto several <em>hundred thousand </em>Family Group Sheets.&#160; These \r\nsheets constitute the Archives&#8217; single most consulted source, making it \r\npossible&#8212;in a matter of minutes&#8212;to determine where and when any given \r\ncouple was married and if that couple had a child or children Baptized \r\nanywhere in the Diocese.&#160; Even a quick glace at any one of the dozens of\r\n meticulously organized binders which line the shelves of Archives&#8217; \r\nresearch area make it clear that a very large number of couples left the\r\n Diocese shortly after marrying (almost always for the adjacent &#8220;Boston \r\nStates&#8221;).&#160; As Ms. McDevitt observes, &#8220;What has also emerged from this \r\nongoing project could be termed &#8216;context&#8217;, a look at the big picture.&#160; \r\nIt affords not merely lists of names and dates, but glimpses of a \r\nculture, of a specific time and place in history. It humanizes the \r\n&#8216;mountain of names.&#8217; &#8221;&#160; While many of the records of the Diocese of \r\nSaint John are available to on-line researchers as part of the <em>Drouin\r\n Collection</em>, this invaluable collection of Group Sheets (and the \r\naccompanying maiden-name index) remain available only on site at the \r\nSaint John facility.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional Resources<br></strong><br>The Diocesan Archives \r\nalso houses a complete set of microfilmed editions of <em>The New \r\nFreeman</em>&#8212;the Diocesan newspaper published since 1900&#8212;together with a\r\n complete card index of &#8220;Freeman&#8221; obituaries and marriages. The Diocesan\r\n Archives also houses the correspondence of all deceased and/or retired \r\nBishops as well as extensive biographical and historical files on the \r\nclergy and parishes of the Diocese; numerous pew rent books, \r\nsubscription and membership lists and minute books (all of which contain\r\n valuable biographical tidpits).<br><br>The Archives of the Diocese of \r\nSaint John, are located on the ground floor of the Diocesan Centre at \r\nOne Bayard Street&#8212;a stone's throw from the Cathedral of the Immaculate \r\nConception in Uptown Saint John. Free parking is available at the front \r\nof the building and a large lot at the side of the building provides \r\nadditional free parking (even for RV's). The Diocesan Centre is within \r\nwalking distance of uptown hotels and restaurants. The exit into the \r\ncity off the Saint John throughway (Route 1) is Exit 123.<br><br>From \r\nSeptember to mid-June, the Archives are open 1:30 to 4:30, Monday \r\nthrough Thursday. During those months, the archives are run as a \r\none-person operation and occasional closures are, therefore, inevitable.\r\n Though drop-ins are welcome, Ms. McDevitt advises that, if possible, \r\nvisitors book an appointment for in-office research. While the archives \r\ndo not charge a set fee for the use of the facility, donations are \r\ngratefully accepted. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Contact Information</strong><br><br>Mary Kilfoil McDevitt, \r\nM.A.<br>Diocesan Archives,<br>One Bayard Drive<br>Saint John NB<br>E2L \r\n3l5<br>Canada<br><br>Tel: (506) 653-6807<br>E-Mail: <a href=\"mailto:archives@dioceseofsaintjohn.org\">archives@dioceseofsaintjohn.org</a></p>\r\n</div></div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/new-brunswick-repositories-archives-of-the-diocese-of-saint-john/", "published": "", "id": 15}, {"author": "David Allen Lambert", "country": "Canada", "title": "New Brunswick Resources at NEHGS", "content": "<div id=\"paging\"><div><p><strong><u>Getting Started</u></strong></p>\r\n<p>&#160;Cusack, Ruby M., <em>Searching your roots in Saint John, New  Brunswick: a beginner's guide</em>.

Qu&#233;bec Vital Records; 2. Ontario French-Catholic \r\nChurch Records; 3. Acadian French-Catholic Church Records; 4. Early US \r\nFrench-Catholic Church Records; 5. Qu&#233;bec Notarial Records and 6. Various other \r\nFrench Records.&#160; Clearly, what these databases have in common is that they \r\ncontain records generated by Canada&#8217;s early French settlers and their \r\ndescendants (whether in Canada or in adjacent American states). &#160;This should be \r\nno surprise since in founding the Drouin Institute, in 1899, Quebec lawyer \r\nJoseph Drouin, defined his mandate as the collection and preservation of French \r\nCanadian and Acadian records.&#160; Assuming control of the Institute in 1938, \r\nJoseph&#8217;s son, Gabriel Drouin, dedicated himself to the microfilming and indexing \r\nof records in French-speaking areas. &#160;It appears that Gabriel Drouin conceived \r\nof New Brunswick, formerly part of the French colony of Acadia, as a \r\n&#8220;French-speaking area&#8221;. During Drouin&#8217;s 1943 research visit to the province, he \r\nundertook the microfilming of church and civil records not only in predominantly \r\nFrench-speaking areas but also in nearly homogeneously English-speaking \r\ncommunities like Saint John, Fredericton and Chatham.&#160;<br><br>One might \r\nlogically expect Drouin&#8217;s &#8220;Acadian French-Catholic Church Records&#8221; database to \r\ninclude occasional references to Irish Catholics baptized, married or buried in \r\npredominantly Acadian New Brunswick parishes and they do.&#160; More importantly for \r\nthe genealogist of Irish descent, this database incorporates virtually <em>all \r\n</em>pre 1900Catholic Church records extant in New Brunswick in 1943, including \r\nseveral hundred thousand references to Irish immigrants and their children. &#160;The \r\noriginals of some of these records&#8212;the early interment records of St. Mary&#8217;s \r\nCemetery, in Saint John, to site one example&#8212;have long since disappeared.&#160; Also \r\nincluded in the &#8220;Acadian French-Catholic Church Records&#8221; database are 1888-1919 \r\ncivil records embracing every county, every religion and every ethnicity in New \r\nBrunswick. <br><br>It would be difficult to overstate the significance of the \r\nDrouin collection for New England genealogical research. &#160;It is estimated that \r\nfrom one-third to one-half of New England residents has a parent, grand-parent \r\nor great-grandparent born in the Maritime Provinces of Eastern Canada, a very \r\nhigh percentage of these in New Brunswick.&#160; This is to say nothing of the \r\ncountless New Englanders who descend from a more remote ancestor who arrived in \r\nNorth America at Saint John, St. Andrew&#8217;s or Miramichi (or at one of several \r\nother New Brunswick ports), many of whom remained in the province at least long \r\nenough to marry or have a child baptized before moving on to the &#8220;Boston \r\nStates&#8221;. <br><br>For much of the first half of the nineteenth century, New \r\nBrunswick was <em>the</em> recognized route from Ireland to New England.&#160; During \r\nthe Napoleonic Wars (1796-1815), the French blockade of the Baltic had forced \r\nthe British to turn to their distant North American colonies for masting and so \r\nwood quickly replaced furs as New Brunswick&#8217;s staple export.&#160; In Ireland, \r\nfarming grew to meet the demand of an English public robbed of its farmers by \r\nthe ambitions of Napoleon.&#160; Following the cessation of war, Irish landlords \r\nreverted from tillage to pasturage, replacing corn with cattle and eventually \r\nmaking the growing mass of rural labourers superfluous.&#160; Saint John ship \r\nowners&#8212;their trading ventures already protected by referential tariffs&#8212;were \r\nquick to recognize, in the burgeoning Irish passenger trade which resulted, both \r\nan opportunity for extra profit and a solution to their ballasting problems.&#160; \r\nBecause of the enormous capacity of timber ships returning to New Brunswick, \r\naccommodation could be provided at prices even the average Irish laborer could \r\nafford.&#160; Saint John&#8217;s proximity to the United States border made it a preferred \r\nroute to North America following passage in Britain of the Passenger Acts of \r\n1816 and 1817, which allowed vessels bound for Colonial ports ten passengers for \r\nevery three carried in American ships.&#160; By the 1820s, ongoing trade links \r\nbetween Saint John and the ports of Cork and Derry provided the tenantry in \r\nthose districts with regular transportation to &#8220;America&#8221; and often at half the \r\nprice of similar passages to Boston.&#160; By the 1840s Saint John had become the \r\nmost Irish town in British North America, notwithstanding the fact that up to \r\nseven-eighths of new arrivals eventually left the city. &#160;Many of those who \r\nremained are buried in St. Mary&#8217;s Cemetery.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Accessing the Hidden Treasures:</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Ancestry.com</em> offers a free two week trial subscription.&#160; In order to \r\nsearch the Acadian French-Catholic Church Records database:</p>\r\n<p>1.

The opportunities to document your research have been greatly enhanced with these records.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p><strong>Vital Records</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>New Brunswick</strong><br>The province of New Brunswick has recently expanded the number of vital records made available to the public. Birth records are available at NEHGS from 1888-1919. There are also late registrations of birth and documentation of those records for the period up to 1887 [<strong>CS88/N43/N433</strong>]. County marriage books start in 1806 and continue through 1919. Provincial marriage registrations start in 1888 and continue to 1919 [<strong>CS88/N43/N432</strong>]. Death registrations commenced in 1888 and are available up to 1951 [<strong>CS88/N43/N434</strong>]. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Nova Scotia</strong><br>Nova Scotia mandated vital records registration starting in 1864, but continued only through 1877. At that point mandatory registration was discontinued and not started again until 1906. NEHGS has the records from this brief period of registration [<strong>CS88/N64/N64</strong>]. There are separate indexes for births, marriages, and deaths. They are filmed in alphabetical order for the entire province, and the indexes are broken down within each letter by county. The records themselves are organized by county.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Prince Edward Island</strong><br>Pre-1887 birth records in Prince Edward Island are composed of copies of baptismal records from the churches [<strong>CS88/P74/P71</strong>]. Marriage records from justices of the peace cover the time period 1831-1888 [<strong>CS88/P74/P712</strong>]. Marriage bonds for the period 1824-1902 are available, with a few dating as early as 1787 [<strong>CS88/P74/P717</strong> ]. Deaths are available up to 1906 [<strong>CS88/P74/P713</strong>]. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Qu&#233;bec</strong><br>Until the twentieth century, the churches in Qu&#233;bec registered vital records. The Drouin Microfilm Collection [<strong>CS88/Q4/I572</strong>] contains records of Catholic and Protestant churches and Jewish synagogues located within the province. While many of these records are indexed, there are a large number that are not. The marriages in the Catholic churches have been abstracted and compiled into a separate provincial-wide index. This index, which covers the period 1760-1930, is available on microfiche [<strong>CS88/Q4/I572</strong>]. There is also a three-volume set of books located on the fifth floor that covers the period 1608-1760 [<strong>CS81/D53/1979</strong>]. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Land and Probate Records</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>New Brunswick</strong><br>In New Brunswick both probate and land records are registered at the county level. The records of Albert County are the only land records held by NEHGS as of December 2001. The index covers 1846-1940, but the records are available only through 1887 [<strong>CS88/N431/A41</strong>].

Island</strong><br>Materials in the Land Records Office in Prince Edward Island have been microfilmed for the period 1769-1872 [<strong>CS88/P74/L36</strong>]. Most of these records deal with land conveyances and mortgages between individuals. Probate records in Prince Edward Island were recorded for the entire island starting in 1771. Records for 1807-1901 are available on microfilm at NEHGS [<strong>CS88/P74/W55</strong>]. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Qu&#233;bec</strong><br>In Qu&#233;bec, notaries recorded the mortgages and deeds as well as probate records. NEHGS has the notarial records for all areas outside of the cities of Montr&#233;al and Qu&#233;bec City. These records are part of the collection held by the Archives Nationales de Qu&#233;bec [<strong>CS88/Q4/R44</strong>]. The time frame available varies from area to area. There is also a separate set of microfiche with copies of many of the individual notaries' indexes to the records [<strong>CS88/Q4/R44</strong>]. There is a finding aid available in the fourth floor microtext room to assist you with locating specific notarial records and indexes. For additional information on researching the notarial records, see <a title=\"this article\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/Content.aspx?id=15384\">this article</a> on Qu&#233;bec Recordkeeping.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous Records</strong><br>In addition to the aforementioned records, there are a number of other primary source materials available. For example, there are almost a hundred reels of church records for Prince Edward Island, as well as a few for Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Another invaluable Prince Edward Island resource is the Master Name Index [CS88/P74/P7]. Compiled from census records, cemetery transcriptions, newspapers, atlases, and many other sources, this index provides a look at all inhabitants on the island. </p>\r\n<p>Many early Nova Scotia records were kept in township books. These books included all of the villages within the township. They are available for the following townships: Annapolis, Aylesford, Barrington, Cornwallis, Douglas, Granville, Guysborough, Horton, Liverpool, Maccan, Manchester, Parrsboro, St. Mary's, Shelburne, Westchester, and Yarmouth [<strong>CS88/N642/A93</strong> through <strong>CS88/N642/Y31</strong>].</p>\r\n<p>The microfilm collections of the Archives Nationales de Qu&#233;bec contain a vast number of resources and are also available at NEHGS. In addition to church records and notarial records one can find surveyor records from the Eastern Townships, court records, family records, and seigneurial records, as well as indexes to adoptions and guardianships in the cities of Montr&#233;al and Qu&#233;bec City. A finding aid to the entire collection is available in the microtext department. </p>\r\n<p>For a more complete selection of materials in the NEHGS microtext collection, search the online catalog. If you are interested in donating to the New England and Canada Microtext Acquisitions Project, please contact the Development Office. </p>\r\n<p>The Internet and published print materials are wonderful resources for your research, but verifying all statements in original source documents is imperative if you are to have an accurate view of your family. And it is a wonderful thrill to see copies of the actual wills and deeds that your ancestors signed so many years ago. I strongly encourage all members to visit the NEHGS Research Library and take advantage of these wonderful resources. The library is open Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Wednesday and Thursday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. From December 1 through March 31 the library closes at 5 p.m. on Wednesdays.</p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/sources-for-canadian-research-on-microfilm-at-NEHGS/", "published": "March 8, 2002", "id": 19}, {"author": "Michael J. Leclerc", "country": "Canada", "title": "St. Albans Passenger Arrival Records", "content": "<p>The border between the United States and Canada is the largest unpatrolled \r\nborder in the world. The friendly relationship that has existed between the two \r\ncountries for most of the past two centuries has allowed these thousands of \r\nmiles to remain free of the fences, ditches, and other barriers erected between \r\nother countries, including the United States and Mexico. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>Since the time of earliest settlement, people have been able to move back and \r\nforth across this border freely. No records were kept of people crossing the \r\nborders in either direction until the late eighteenth century. By this time, \r\nmassive waves of immigrants were coming to the United States from Europe. Many \r\nof these individuals came through Canada before coming to the States, especially \r\nthose coming from the British Isles. There were two major reasons for immigrants \r\nto take this route.</p>\r\n<p>Canada was and continues to be part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. \r\nAt that time people living in Canada were subjects of the British monarch. Thus \r\nthose emigrating from Scotland, England, and Ireland were not really leaving the \r\ncountry when they came to Canada. The second reason for immigrating to Canada \r\nfirst was because of the immigrant quota system. Severe restrictions were placed \r\non the number of individuals who could enter the United States from Europe. \r\nThere were relatively few restrictions on those coming from Canada however. Thus \r\nthere was incentive for immigrants to go to Canada first, then move on to the \r\nUnited States. </p>\r\n<p>In 1891 the United States Congress overhauled the system of tracking \r\nimmigration to this country. Among other things they required the keeping of \r\ncertain information on passenger lists. They also created the Bureau of \r\nImmigration, which today is known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service. \r\nAs part of this overhaul, the Bureau of Immigration asked the government of \r\nCanada to allow U.S. Commissioners of Immigration to be stationed in Canadian \r\nports such as Halifax, Montr&#233;al, Qu&#233;bec, and Vancouver. </p>\r\n<p>Border crossing stations had been set up across the entire border by 1895 and \r\nCanadian shipping and rail companies had agreed to keep manifests of all \r\npassengers. U.S. agents were allowed to examine incoming passengers in Canadian \r\nports. The first U.S. immigration inspector was originally stationed in \r\nMontr&#233;al. By 1895 he had relocated to St. Albans, Vermont. Thus the entire \r\nrecord series is commonly known as the \"St. Albans Passenger Lists\" or the \"St. \r\nAlbans Border Crossings.\"</p>\r\n<p>The records of these border crossings from 1895 to 1954 are available from \r\nthe National Archives and Records Administration in several series:</p>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><table cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\" class=\"contentTableText\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Manifests</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\">&#160; </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\"><p>M1464</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\"><p>Manifests of Passengers Arriving in the St. Albans, Vermont District through \r\nCanadian Pacific and Atlantic Ports, 1895-1954 (608 reels)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\"><p>M1465</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\"><p>Manifests of Passengers Arriving in the St. Albans, Vermont, District through \r\nCanadian Pacific Ports, 1929-1949 (25 reels)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Indexes</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\">&#160; </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\"><p>M1461</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\"><p>Soundex Index to Canadian Border Entries through the St. Albans, Vermont, \r\nDistrict, 1895-1924 (400 reels)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\"><p>M1462</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\"><p>Alphabetical Index to Canadian Border Entries through Small Ports in Vermont, \r\n1895-1924 (6 reels)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\"><p>M1463</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\"><p>Soundex Index to Entries into the St. Albans, Vermont, District through \r\nCanadian Pacific and Atlantic Ports, 1924-1952 (98 reels)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\"><p>M1478</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td class=\"Normal\"><p>Card Manifests (Alphabetical) of Individuals Entering through the Port of \r\nDetroit, Michigan, 1906-1954 (117 reels)</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div><p>This series of films is an invaluable aid if your family was involved in the \r\nmassive migration from Europe through Canada into the U.S., or if your ancestors \r\nwere French-Canadians or other long-time inhabitants who moved to the United \r\nStates at the same time. These films are available at the National Archives in \r\nWashington, DC, many of the regional branches, LDS Family History Library, the \r\nNew England Historic Genealogical Society, and many other major repositories \r\nthroughout the country. Don't overlook this resource, even if it appears it is \r\nthe wrong time frame for your ancestors!</p>\r\n<p>These lists are valuable even for people whose ancestors crossed the border \r\nprior to 1895. How? If immigrants came to the U.S. in the 1870s or 1880s and \r\nleft family behind in Canada, they may have gone back to visit after 1895. In \r\nthat event, they would be captured in the border crossing lists when they were \r\nreturning to their homes in the U.S. </p>\r\n<p>The Soundex records through 1924 have a box in the upper right hand corner \r\ntitled \"Serial No.\" In this space there should be three numbers recorded. This \r\nis the volume number, the page number, and the line number for the entry of a \r\nparticular person. For example, the card for Josephine (Lavallee) LeClerc shows \r\nthat she entered the United States on October 30, 1919. The numbers recorded are \r\n517-47-13. Turning to page 47 in volume 517 finds her entry recorded on line \r\nnumber 13. The manifests are filmed by volume number. The page numbers are \r\nstamped in the lower left-hand corner of each sheet. Remember that it sometimes \r\ntook up to three frames to film an entire sheet. The number will only appear in \r\nthe corner of the actual sheet, not in the corner of each frame.</p>\r\n<p>Ship passenger lists usually included several different manifests for each \r\nship, with different information being recorded for several different groups of \r\npeople. For example, The S.S. <em>Montcalm</em> arrived in St. John, New \r\nBrunswick, February 7, 1926. The first manifest, list A, included all aliens who \r\nhad sailed from the port of Greenock January 30, 1926. The second manifest was a \r\nlist of United States citizens sailing from Liverpool on January 29.Next is a \r\nlist of aliens sailing from Liverpool. The next list included aliens sailing \r\nfrom the port of Belfast on January 30. The last manifest included more aliens \r\nsailing from Greenock. </p>\r\n<p>As can be seen from the above example, it is important to note from the card \r\nwhether or not the person crossing the border was a United States citizen.

A manifest \r\ncard system was used to track these crossings. The cards are filed with the \r\ncards indexing the passenger lists for ships, which continue to be recorded. I \r\nfound my grandfather Joseph Ruel crossing into the United States through the \r\nport of Newport, Vermont, with his wife Yvonne and their five children: Roger, \r\nSimonne, Renaud, Yvette, and Marie Reine on March 19, 1926. There was a \r\ncross-reference card for his wife and each of the children that referred me back \r\nto the card for Joseph. In addition to the information above, there was a \r\ncitation on the back of the card indicating his alien registration number, \r\nAR2911043. Using this number I can request a copy of his alien registration file \r\nfrom the Immigration and Naturalization Service under the Freedom of Information \r\nAct. Another citation indicates that his alien registration and date of \r\nimmigration were verified in 1941. </p>\r\n<p>The information maintained on manifest lists continued to change as the \r\ntwentieth century wore on. In addition, a new kind of manifest starts to appear \r\nin the last years of the lists. By the 1940s and 1950s air travel was becoming \r\ncommonplace. The airlines were also required to keep manifests. The manifest for \r\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines Flight KL656 in March of 1954 lists the names of the \r\ncrew members and their nationality. The plane departed Orly, France March 18 and \r\nShannon, Ireland, March 19. It also departed from Montreal the same day and \r\nlanded in Chicago, Illinois, the same day. The names of the ten passengers on \r\nthe plane are recorded, along with the number of pieces of luggage and the \r\nweight of that luggage. </p>\r\n<p>The St. Albans border crossing lists are invaluable sources of information \r\nfor those researching both U.S. and Canadian ancestors. If your ancestor \r\nimmigrated to this country, they may have returned home for a visit and be \r\nrecorded. If your ancestors are from Canada, they may appear on the lists when \r\nthey go to visit a family member who had immigrated to the U.S. They are well \r\nworth the effort it takes to use them, despite their drawbacks.</p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/st-albans-passenger-arrival-records/", "published": "May 4, 2000", "id": 20}, {"author": "Sherry L.

New \r\nHampshire was no stranger to this migration phenomenon. The mills in New \r\nHampshire towns and cities were eager for the labor this new population provided \r\nand they actively recruited French Canadians to resettle there<sup>3</sup>. And \r\nsettle they did, in large numbers. French Canadians are the third largest \r\nancestry group in New England, following English and Irish, <sup>4</sup> and \r\naccording to the last two New Hampshire censuses, this finding holds true in the \r\nGranite State. Three interesting New Hampshire Franco-American portraits can be \r\nfound on the American Life Histories: The Federal Writers' Project \r\nwebsite.<sup>5</sup> These are \"Franco-American Grandmother,\" \"Reminiscences of \r\nM.

The ACGS Library, located at 4 Elm Street in Manchester, \r\nNew Hampshire, is open Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Saturday \r\nfrom 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Professor Roger W. Lawrence (St. Anselm College) and \r\nLucille Caron-Lagasse founded the Society in 1973. The accomplishments of this \r\nsociety as it relates to research holdings in such a time are phenomenal. </p>\r\n<p>The Society maintains one of the largest resource facilities for French \r\nCanadian research in the United States. While the library keeps an extensive \r\ncollection of materials from outside the state, the purpose of this article is \r\nto identify resources that are specific to New Hampshire research. It is \r\nimportant to note that a study of the migratory patterns of early American \r\nCanadians shows frequent movement between the New England states and Canada. The \r\navailability of records in other areas of popular Franco migration is a great \r\nasset to the researcher in tracing their French Canadian lines back.</p>\r\n<p>The staff volunteers are very willing and capable in assisting the researcher \r\nwith their family search. Their collective knowledge and experience in the \r\nsubject matter and their familiarity with the library&#8217;s holdings have saved many \r\nthe family historian hours of needless run around. They are very adept at \r\n&#8220;translating&#8221; the slaughter of French surnames by English speaking clerks in \r\nearly New Hampshire times, which has led to many variations of spelling and \r\npronunciation of the French family names we find today. As with any operation \r\nrun by volunteers, the library hours of operation may not always be consistent. \r\nVisitors traveling any distance should call ahead to ensure that the library \r\nwill be open. It is not unusual to close early in bad weather, for example. The \r\nlibrary&#8217;s phone number is 603-622-1554. </p>\r\n<p>The ACGS Library&#8217;s most valuable resource is their collection of parish \r\nrepertories. The New Hampshire church record collection is housed in \r\ntwenty-seven feet of stack space in the facility. These records cover the period \r\nfrom the second half of the nineteenth century through modern times. Additional \r\nrepertories include those for the provinces of Qu&#233;bec, Ontario, and New \r\nBrunswick and the states of Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. They have \r\nlimited resources for Alberta, Manitoba, New York, Louisiana, and many other \r\nstates and provinces.</p>\r\n<p>Their microfilm and microfiche holdings include vital records of New \r\nHampshire to 1900. This gives the researcher with a day job an opportunity to \r\nsearch the New Hampshire vital record collection two evenings a week and \r\nSaturdays, whereas the State Office in Concord is only open during business \r\nhours. Among other holdings are the vital records of Vermont 1760-1908; index \r\nand registers of births and marriages in Massachusetts 1840-1895; the Loiselle \r\nfile of Qu&#233;becois marriages; the Moncton index; the St. Albans, Vermont Index of \r\nBorder Crossings, and registers of Vital Statistics of South Eastern New \r\nBrunswick. </p>\r\n<p>The Obituary Project started in 1979 and includes all obituaries from the \r\n<em>Manchester Union Leader</em>, the <em>Concord Monitor</em>, and the <em>Nashua \r\nTranscript</em> newspapers. The obituaries are photocopied and each year is bound \r\nin a three-ring binder and indexed. Collections for many pertinent out of state \r\npapers are also found at the library to assist the researcher with wandering \r\nfamily members. An important resource is Lowell Deaths from 1900, copied from \r\nthe city clerk&#8217;s report each year. With Lowell just over the border in \r\nMassachusetts, many families are tied to New Hampshire research. City \r\ndirectories for Manchester date back to 1866 and for Concord back to 1880. A \r\ngrowing collection of other city directories and town reports for many New \r\nHampshire towns may be found there, as well as many from out of state. </p>\r\n<p>Valuable reference anthologies include Arsenault&#8217;s <em>Histoire et Genealogie \r\ndes Acadiens</em>, Bergeron&#8217;s <em>Le grand r&#233;arrangement des Acadiens</em>, the \r\nDrouin Institute&#8217;s <em>Dictionnaire National des Canadiens Fran&#231;ais, \r\n1608-1760</em>, Jett&#233;&#8217;s <em>Dictionnaire g&#233;n&#233;alogique des familles du Qu&#233;bec des \r\norigines &#224; 1730</em>, Tanguay&#8217;s <em>Dictionnaire G&#233;n&#233;alogique des Familles \r\nCanadiennes depuis la Fondation de la Colonie Jusqu'&#224; nos Jours</em>, and White&#8217;s \r\n<em>Dictionnaire G&#233;n&#233;alogique des Familles Acadiennes</em>. The <em>Relations des \r\nJ&#233;suites</em> <em>1610-1791 </em>(Reuben Gold Thwaites: 1896) is an invaluable \r\nindexed collection of period Jesuit diaries. Most of these invaluable French \r\nCanadian resources are covered in more detail in Michael J. Leclerc&#8217;s article, \r\n&#8220;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/research/services/articles_intro_french_canadian_research.asp\">Introduction \r\nto French Canadian Resources</a>.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>The usual assortment of family histories/genealogies (600+), how-to books, \r\nand general history books can also be found on the library shelves.

The Society publishes a quarterly journal distributed \r\nto all members that includes articles of family research contributed by members, \r\nbook reviews, queries, and items for sale by the Society (including many of \r\ntheir repertories), to name but a few items.

During the course of his work, Joseph sold over fifteen \r\nhundred family genealogies and compiled over five hundred thousand reference \r\nsheets for French-Canadian genealogical research. </p>\r\n<p>Gabriel continued his father&#8217;s work, and upon completion of his law education \r\nat the University of Montr&#233;al, opened a headquarters for the <em>Insitut</em> at \r\n4184 rue St. Denis in Montr&#233;al. Pictures of the headquarters can be seen below. \r\nGabriel soon set his sights on undertaking one of the largest French-Canadian \r\ngenealogical projects ever.<em></em></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Canadian_Family_History/drouin2.jpg\" alt=\"Drouin Institute\" title=\"Drouin Institute\"></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><em>The Drouin Institute \r\n</em></p>\r\n<p>In 1938, <em>L&#8217;Institut G&#233;n&#233;alogique Drouin</em> set about microfilming church \r\nand civil records to document the history of French-Canadians.

Leclerc", "country": "Canada", "title": "The Name Game \u2013 Tips for Finding the Real Names of French-Canadian Ancestors", "content": "<p>One of the most difficult areas many researchers face when tracing their \r\nFrench-Canadian roots is discovering the actual names of their ancestors in \r\nQu&#233;bec. How many would guess that a man named John King would actually be a \r\nFrench-Canadian formerly called Jean Roi? And once back in Canada, what naming \r\npractices there affect research?</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p><strong>French-Canadian Surnames in the United States</strong></p>\r\n<p>First let us discuss the subject of French-Canadian names in the United \r\nStates. French-Canadians were among the first explorers of the American West. \r\nThe Lewis and Clark expedition employed French-Canadians to help lead their \r\nparty. American entrepreneurs built fortunes in the fur trade with the \r\nassistance of French-Canadian trappers. When the United States made the \r\nLouisiana Purchase many of their descendants became Americans. </p>\r\n<p>In addition to these early individuals, thousands of immigrants came into the \r\nUnited States from the late nineteenth through the early twentieth centuries. \r\nAmong the biggest fallacies about immigrant name changes in the United States \r\nare that &#8220;the name was changed at Ellis Island&#8221; or &#8220;the name was changed when \r\nthey crossed the border.&#8221; The reality is that United States immigration agents \r\nstationed at border crossings spoke the native languages of immigrants. It was \r\nonly after the immigrants had settled here that their names were changed.</p>\r\n<p>When their names were changed, some were simply translated literally. Jean \r\nRoi became John King. Etienne Lariviere became Steven Rivers. Michel Roch became \r\nMichael Stone. These individuals can be very difficult to locate, as their \r\nanglicized names often give no indication of their previous French origins. It \r\ntakes detailed analysis of sources, such as church, census, and vital records, \r\nfor clues to a French origin. If you do come across an individual with an \r\nEnglish-sounding name, but there is reason to suspect that they might be French, \r\nlook to see if there is a translation of the surname that would be a common \r\nFrench-Canadian surname.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to literal translations, names were often anglicized. \r\nEnglish-speaking individuals often changed names by recording them as how they \r\nwere heard, as opposed to how they were actually spelled. For example, the name \r\nRoch can become Rush, Ouellet can change to Willet, and LaJoie (pronounced \r\nla-zhwa in French) often becomes Lashua. When researching a Franco-American \r\nindividual, sound out their name and spell it phonetically. Try substituting \r\ndifferent letters and you may discover your actual French surname.</p>\r\n<p>As a side note, not all immigrants to New France were French. Settlers came \r\nfrom Germany, England, Scotland, Portugal, Spain, and even Romania, as well as \r\nother European countries. The infamous Battle of the Plains of Abraham, at which \r\nthe English conquered the French, took place on the lands originally owned by \r\nAbraham Martin, a seventeenth-century immigrant from Scotland. As these \r\nindividuals came to Qu&#233;bec, their names would often be gallicized, just as \r\nFrench-Canadians had their names anglicized in the United States. Thus Simon \r\nGreenleaf of England became Simon Vertefeuille and Joao Rodriguez of Portugal \r\nbecame Jean Rodrigue. </p>\r\n<p><strong>First Names in French-Canada</strong></p>\r\n<p>The second area that can be difficult when tracing your Franco-American \r\nancestors back into Qu&#233;bec is that of first names. Most French-Canadians carried \r\ntwo or more names in addition to their surname. French-Canadians were almost \r\nuniversally Catholic. Although many of the early settlers were French \r\nProtestants, most of the lands of New France were granted to Catholic orders, \r\nsuch as the Jesuits. Once these Catholic orders arrived, they forced the \r\nProtestants back to Catholicism. </p>\r\n<p>In order to honor the church, many males carried the baptismal name of \r\nJoseph. Many females were baptized as Marie. These names were carried to honor \r\nJoseph and Mary, the parents of Jesus. In addition to these names, people would \r\ncarry one or two additional names, i.e., Joseph Pierre, Joseph Louis, Marie \r\nLaura, Marie Alma, and so forth.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>As a rule, individuals would use the name closest to their last name for \r\neveryday use. The first and middle names could also be switched over time, \r\nespecially after immigrants left for the United States. As an example, my \r\ngrandmother was Yvette C&#233;a Ruel. This is the name on her marriage certificate, \r\ndeath certificate, and the one engraved on her gravestone. Obtaining a copy of \r\nher baptismal certificate showed that the name given her at birth was Marie C&#233;a \r\nYvette Ruel. When I mentioned this to my mother, she stated that her mother had \r\nalways hated the name C&#233;a, and rarely mentioned it at all. This would explain \r\nwhy she used Yvette her entire adult life.</p>\r\n<p>This is, however, a general rule for research, and not a mandatory practice. \r\nFor example, my paternal grandfather was named Joseph Alfred Leclerc. Throughout \r\nhis life he was known as Fred. To my knowledge, he was never called Joseph. His \r\nfather was Joseph Pierre Leclerc. He was called Joseph or Joe his entire life, \r\nnever using the name Pierre. </p>\r\n<p>Sometimes the names would run together. For example, Marie Anne could \r\nsometimes become Marianne. The two names could also be used together and not \r\nseparated. For example, Marie Louise would always be known as Marie Louise, not \r\nLouise or Marie. Names that in English are traditionally masculine or feminine \r\ncan also be used in different ways in French. Jean-Marie is a common name for \r\nmen. And in early Qu&#233;bec, many women were known as Marie Josephe instead of \r\nMarie Josephte. </p>\r\n<p>Remember these naming practices as you trace your family back to Qu&#233;bec. When \r\nlooking for baptismal records, or even for marriage records, look for the first \r\nnames of Joseph and Marie in addition to others. This may be the clue that \r\nunlocks the hidden records. </p>\r\n<p><strong>&#8220;Dit&#8221; Names</strong></p>\r\n<p>In contrast to the English colonies to her south, New France had a very small \r\nnumber of immigrants. With a limited number of immigrant surnames, and with so \r\nmany individuals being baptized as Marie or Joseph, it would quickly have become \r\ndifficult to differentiate between ancestors with identical names. It is not \r\nuncommon at all to have, say, a Joseph Lebrun, who was son of Joseph Lebrun, \r\nwith a nephew, cousin, and grandson all named Joseph Lebrun as well. </p>\r\n<p>The practice of using &#8220;dit&#8221; names is one that was carried over from France to \r\ntheir colony in the New World. Dit literally means &#8220;called in French.&#8221; These \r\nnames are used to differentiate between individuals who have the same surname \r\nand often the same first name. These names were appended onto the surname. Over \r\ntime, some descendants can end up dropping the original surname and the dit name \r\nbecomes the surname.</p>\r\n<p>For example, my surname is Leclerc. My patrilineal immigrant ancestor was a \r\nman named Louis Houde. One of his descendants was a man named Gabriel Houde who \r\nmarried Jeanne Petitclair. Their descendants were called Houde dit Clair. Their \r\ngreat-grandson was Abraham Houde dit Clair. He married as Abraham Clair. During \r\nthe course of his life Clair became Leclair, and eventually Leclerc. Some \r\ndescendants still use the Leclair spelling variation.</p>\r\n<p>Dit names came from many different sources, among them:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Military service </li>\r\n<li>Land name or location </li>\r\n<li>Place of origin </li>\r\n<li>Descriptives (such as hair color, personality, weight, etc.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The good news is that most of the dit names are known. Several compilation of \r\ndit names have been published, among them one co-authored by the great \r\nFrench-Canadian genealogist Ren&#233; Jett&#233;, <em>Repertoire des noms de famille du \r\nQuebec des origines a 1825</em> [<strong>CS88/Q4/J47/1988</strong>]. This book is available \r\nin the NEHGS Research Library.</p>\r\n<p>Tracing your ancestors back to Canada can be difficult. French-Canadian and \r\nFranco-American naming patterns can contain major clues to finding your \r\nancestors in their home of Qu&#233;bec. When tracking these individuals, make no \r\nassumptions about their names and variations that might exist between their \r\noriginal form and their final form in the United States. You may indeed find \r\nyourself in the middle of a &#8220;name game,&#8221; but one that you are likely to win if \r\nyou know the rules of play.</p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/tips-for-finding-the-real-names-of-french-canadian-ancestors/", "published": "August 16, 2002", "id": 23}, {"author": "Michael J. Leclerc", "country": "Canada", "title": "The Programme de Recherche en D\u00e9mographie Historique (PDRH)", "content": "<p>Over three decades ago the University of Montr&#233;al embarked upon an ambitious project that has had a tremendous effect on many areas of research, including history, demography, and genealogy. The Programme de Recherche en D&#233;mographie Historique was founded in 1966. It is commonly known as the PRDH and is one of the most important resources for French-Canadian research in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>French-Canadians have been the subjects of many different studies through the years because of the small, tightly woven population of the area. In comparison to the English colonies to their south, which experienced almost 400,000 immigrants in the seventeenth century, New France had only 15,000 immigrants. Many of these either returned to France or died shortly after arrival. All people of French-Canadian descent today are descended from the 10,000 remaining men and women who settled this stark territory in the seventeenth century. </p>\r\n<p>The PRDH was founded to conduct an exhaustive study of these individuals, as well as their descendants and additional immigrants through the seventeenth century. The program utilized a cadre of college students to abstract hundreds of thousands of records. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Parish Records<br></strong>One hundred fifty-three parishes in the province were examined for records of baptisms, marriages, and burials. For the period through 1765 all names mentioned in the records were transcribed. For the period 1766 through 1799, only the names of those related to the subject or subjects of the record were transcribed. Other names were omitted. Both the ecclesiastical copies in the churches and the civil copies sent to the provincial government were examined to ensure completeness. Cyprien Tanguay, in his <em>Dictionnaire g&#233;n&#233;alogique des familles canadiennes depuis la fondation de la colonie jusqu&#8217;&#224; nos jours </em>(Montreal: E. S&#233;n&#233;cal, 1871&#8211;90) listed 815 records not found in the original registers, mostly in the parishes of Sorel, Saint-Augustin, and Petite-Rivi&#232;re-Saint-Fran&#231;ois. These records were added to the project database. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Abjuration Records</strong><br>Parish registers often contain other information besides baptisms, marriages, and burials. Especially in the early years of settlement, many individuals who were not Catholic immigrated to the colony. Upon settling in the colony they were required to abjure their heresy and convert to Catholicism. Hundreds of abjuration records are included here. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Confirmation Records<br></strong>Upon growing to young adulthood, Catholics are required to confirm their beliefs in church teachings. Confirmation records usually contain just the name of the individual being confirmed, and over 500 confirmations are included in the PRDH. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Annulments</strong><br>In the wilderness, a priest was not always readily available to perform marriages. Individuals wishing to be married often did not want to wait for the months (or years) it would take for a priest to arrive and bless the marriage. In cases such as this, the couple would compose a marriage contract and proceed to live together as husband and wife, often having several children. When the priest finally arrived, he would &#8220;rehabilitate&#8221; the marriage, giving it the blessing of the church and making the children legitimate in the eyes of the church. The church rarely offered to annul marriages, but there are four annulments included in the PRDH. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Censuses</strong><br>In addition to parish records, several other record groups were examined. There were three censuses of New France in the seventeenth century: one in 1666, one in 1667, and one in 1681. Smaller censuses of local areas, such as Mont Louis and Qu&#233;bec City were undertaken in the eighteenth century through the time of the conquest. Many of these censuses listed all members of the family, not just the heads of household. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Marriage Contracts</strong><br>It was the custom to visit a notary to take out a contract for a marriage prior to the religious ceremony. Thousands of marriage contracts were examined by the PDRH for additional information on individuals whose marriage records were missing or incomplete. For most of these records, only the information concerning the bride and groom and their parents was abstracted. The names of other individuals, including other possible family members, were omitted. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Immigration Records</strong><br>Lists of immigrants to New France were compiled from various sources, which led to the identification of over 1,200 settlers. Many of these individuals were named in lists published by various archives through the years. In addition, a few individuals chose to become naturalized citizens of France. Many individuals did not come to New France intending to settle permanently. For example, many men came to serve as soldiers. A number of these individuals settled in the colony permanently, married, and raised families. Because these individuals were so far from home, it would sometimes be difficult for them to prove their marital status. Often they would have friends or acquaintances that had known them in France testify as to their ability to be married legally, with no prior family existing back home. These testimonies are rich in details about places of origin. </p>\r\n<strong>Publishing the Records</strong><p>In 1980 the PRDH began publishing volumes of the information they had collected. For the next ten years they published forty-seven volumes of data covering the period through 1765. These volumes are published in several segments by year. Records of each parish are published together, but separated into baptisms, marriages, and burials. Each parish has its own index, and cumulative indexes were published for each time period. These indexes do not standardize surname spellings and there is no master list of variations. One must determine all possible variant spellings of a surname to ensure thoroughness. </p>\r\n<p>Records are presented in a standardized format. The top right side of each entry lists the dates mentioned in the record. While marriages have only one date, baptisms often mention the dates of birth and baptism, while burial records usually include the date of death. Dates are indicated in the standard European format: year-month-day. The left side includes the source for the record. The source is only indicated for those records that did not come from the original parish registers, so in most records this space is blank. </p>\r\n<p>Underneath are listed all of the individuals listed in the record. Each person is given an identification number, starting with number 1 for the individual who is the subject of the record. In marriage records, grooms are always given number 1 and brides are given number 2. The parents are listed after the subject or subjects, followed by other individuals. The relationship between the individuals is given. Then their marital status is given with abbreviations: C=single, M=married, V=widowed, S= separated. The next to last column indicates whether the person was present at the occasion. For example, many women did not attend the baptism of their child as they were home recuperating from the birth. The last column indicates thegender ofthe individual. </p>\r\n<p>The years 1766 through 1799 were published in 1999 on CD-ROM. For the first time the surnames were standardized, making searching a great deal easier. The search variations were greater as well, with the ability to search on any number of criteria. A full version of the PRDH was released in 2000, covering the years 1621 through 1799. </p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">&#160;</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img title=\"Programme 01\" alt=\"Programme 01\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Canadian_Family_History/programme1.jpg\"><br><br><em>Baptism entry as shown&#160;in the PDRH volumes</em></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><em><br></em></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img title=\"Programme 02\" alt=\"Programme 02\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Canadian_Family_History/programme2.jpg\"><br><em>Marriage entry<br></em>&#160;&#160; </p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><img title=\"Programme 03\" alt=\"Programme 03\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Canadian_Family_History/programme3.jpg\"><br><em>Burial entry</em></p>\r\n<p><br>Also in 2000 a website was created containing the information from the PRDH database. The database is organized into three sections. The first contains a list of all vital records through 1799. Then there is a genealogical dictionary of families from 1621 to 1765. This section links individuals through their vital records. </p>\r\n<p>The final section contains is called the Repertory of Couples and Filial Relations, 1621-1799. This section links couples to their children. It allows quick linking from generation to generation and lets the user trace ancestors or descendants for two hundred years very quickly. All marriages to 1800 are included. </p>\r\n<p>While it is very expensive to purchase the CD-ROMs ($580 US), subscriptions to the web database are based on the number of pages viewed.

The site is available in both French and English. </p>\r\n<p>The PRDH is one of the major resources available for early French-Canadian ancestors. No researcher can be without the useful information they have created. However, like all secondary sources, it should be used as a resource to access the original records, not as a source itself. Errors and omissions did occur, but using the PRDH as an index makes locating original records infinitely easier. </p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/the-programme-de-recherche/", "published": "", "id": 24}, {"author": "Michael J.

His discourse on Montreal, for example, \r\nincludes the following description of late-eighteenth-century funeral practices: \r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>The funerals, as in other Roman Catholic countries, are conducted with great \r\nceremony; the corpse is always attended to the church by a number of priests \r\nchanting prayers, and by little boys in white robes and black caps carrying wax \r\nlights. A morning scarcely ever passed over that one of more of these \r\nprocessions did not pass under our windows while we were at breakfast; for on \r\nthe opposite side of the square to that on which the cathedral stood, was a sort \r\nof chapel, to which the bodies of all those persons, whose friends could not \r\nafford to pay for an expensive funeral, were brought, I suppose, in the night, \r\nfor we couldn't ever see any carried in there, and from thence conveyed in the \r\nmorning to the cathedral. If the priests are paid for it they go to the house of \r\nthe deceased, though it be ever so far distant, and escort the corpse to the \r\nchurch. Until within a few years past, it was customary to bury all the bodies \r\nin the vaults underneath the cathedral; but now it is prohibited, lest some \r\nputrid disorder should break out in the town, in consequence of such numbers \r\nbeing deposited there. The burying grounds are all without walls at \r\npresent<sup>1</sup>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Weld's description helps us picture the funeral of our \r\ngreat-great-great-great-grandparents, with the altar boys carrying candles for \r\nthe priests as they process to the church. Funerals obviously occurred during \r\nthe morning hours--the processions would pass by while the author was eating \r\nbreakfast--a practice that persists today. The cemetery as a rolling field with \r\nno barrier to separate it, which the author felt unusual enough to mention, is a \r\nvivid picture of their final resting-place.</p>\r\n<p>Weld also relates some fascinating and colorful descriptions of the towns \r\nthat he visited, such as this one of the town of Trois Rivi&#232;res, Qu&#233;bec: </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>The streets in Trois Rivieres are narrow, and the houses in general small and \r\nindifferent; many of them are built of wood. There are two churches in the town \r\nthe one an English episcopalian, the other a large Roman Catholic parish church, \r\nformerly served by the Recollets, or Franciscan friars, but the order is now \r\nextinct in Trois Rivieres. The old monastery of the order, a large stone \r\nbuilding, at present lies quite deserted; and many of the houses in the \r\nneighbourhood being also uninhabited, that part of the town wherein it is \r\nsituated has a very dull gloomy aspect. The college or monastery of the Jesuits, \r\nalso a large old building of stone in the same neighbourhood, has been converted \r\ninto a gaol <sup>2</sup>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Canada is often thought of as our cold neighbor to the north, but how many of \r\nus have actually seriously looked at the meteorological challenges that faced \r\nour hardy ancestors? Weld tells us about the weather in this passage: </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>The extremes of heat and cold in Canada are amazing; in the months of July \r\nand August the thermometer, according to Fahrenheit, is often known to rise to \r\n96&#176;, yet a winter scarcely passes over but even the mercury itself freezes. \r\nThose very sudden transitions, however, from heat to cold, so common in the \r\nUnited States, and so very injurious to the constitution, are unknown in Canada; \r\nthe seasons also are much more regular<sup>3</sup>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Because of the severe cold one might imagine that Canadian winters were spent \r\nhuddled in the house in front of the fire once the animals were tended to. \r\nNothing could be further from the truth. Winter in Canada was a time of great \r\ncelebration, a time when farmers and their families could let down their hair, \r\nso to speak, and enjoy themselves. Weld's travelogue may make us rethink our \r\nimage of life during the Canadian winter, \"the season of general amusement\": \r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>The clear frosty weather no sooner commences than all thoughts about business \r\nare laid aside, and every one devotes himself to pleasure. The inhabitants meet \r\nin convivial parties at each other's houses, and pass the day with music, \r\ndancing, card-playing, and every social entertainment that can beguile the time. \r\nAt Montreal, in particular, such a constant and friendly intercourse is kept up \r\namongst the inhabitants, that, as I have often heard it mentioned, it appears \r\nthen as if the town were inhabited but by one large \r\nfamily<sup>4</sup>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Transportation in Canada was actually much easier in winter than at other \r\ntimes. Horses and oxen could be attached to sleighs, carioles, fledges, and the \r\nlike, to bring them long distances over the frozen waterways and icy ground. How \r\nmuch faster and more comfortable it was glide to one's destination than to \r\nattempt the rutted, muddy roads in the spring!</p>\r\n<p>Weld describes different modes of transportation during his journey. At one \r\npoint he discusses the \"calash,\" a type of carriage used by the settlers in \r\nLower Canada. He writes: </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>The calash is a carriage very generally used in Lower Canada; there is \r\nscarcely a farmer indeed in the country who does not possess one: it is a sort \r\nof one horse chaise, capable of holding two people besides the driver, who sits \r\non a kind of box placed over the foot-board, expressly for his accommodation. \r\nThe body of the calash is hung upon broad straps of leather, round iron rollers \r\nthat are placed behind, by means of which they are shortened or lengthened. On \r\neach side of the carriage is a little door about two feet high, whereby you \r\nenter it, and which is useful, when shut, in preventing any thing from slipping \r\nout. The harness for the horse is always made in the old French taste, extremely \r\nheavy; it is studded with brass nails, and to particular parts of it are \r\nattached small bells, of no use that I could ever discover but to annoy the \r\npassenger<sup>5</sup>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The picture below accompanies this description. Imagine riding through the \r\ncountry with the accompaniment of the ringing bells!</p>\r\n<p>Weld describes other kinds of transportation as he experienced them. \r\nTraveling customs that have long fallen into disuse can be fascinating. For \r\nexample, Weld describes how travel in Qu&#233;bec involved the \"Bons Dieux\": </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>The Bons Dieux are large wooden crucifixes, sometimes upwards of twenty feet \r\nin height, placed on the highway; some of them are highly ornamented and \r\nappointed; as the people pass they pull off their hats, or in some other way \r\nmake obeisance to them<sup>6</sup>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>During the spring, summer, and fall much of the transportation was done by \r\nway of Canada's vast number of rivers, lakes and streams. The map reproduced \r\nfrom Weld's book (below) gives but a small inkling of this vast network.</p>\r\n<p>In his published memoirs, entitled <em>Travels in North American in the Years \r\n1827 and 1828,</em> Captain Basil Hall gives extensive notes on his voyages in \r\nUpper and Lower Canada (now the provinces of Ontario and Qu&#233;bec). He gives us a \r\ndramatic picture of the French-Canadian voyageur, who often transported people \r\nand their cargo: </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>I had often before seen small canoes paddled by a couple of Indians, but it \r\nwas a very different thing to feel oneself flying along in the grand barge, as \r\nit might be called, nearly forty feet long, by upwards of five in width. She was \r\nurged forward at the rate of nearly six miles an hour, by fourteen first-rate \r\nand well-practised Canadian Voyageurs...<br><br>Each Voyageur wields a short, \r\nlight paddle, with which he strikes the water about once in a second, keeping \r\nstrict time with a song from one of the crew, in which all the others join in \r\nchorus. At every stroke of the fourteen paddles, which in fact resemble one \r\nblow, such is the correctness of their ear, the canoe is thrown or jerked \r\nforward so sharply, that it is by no means easy to sit upright on the cloaks and \r\ncushions spread nearly in its centre<sup>7</sup>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>One can almost see the burly, bearded Frenchmen traversing the waterways of \r\nCanada with their loads of furs, supplies, and, of course, settlers!</p>\r\n<p>One of difficulties facing settlers in Qu&#233;bec was their own lack of modern \r\nfarming tools and techniques. This, combined with smaller and smaller farms as \r\nparcels were divided among children from generation to generation, was one of \r\nthe major reasons for the massive migration of French-Canadians into the United \r\nStates in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In 1833 Captain J. E. \r\nAlexander published his <em>Transatlantic Sketches, Comprising Visits to the Most \r\nInteresting Scenes in North and South America, and The West Indies.</em> In \r\naddition to very strong opinions, Captain Alexander provides some insights into \r\nthe habits of the people he writes about: </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>I was much gratified in witnessing the comfort of the French habitans of \r\nLower Canada; their neat houses, clean persons--their abundant fare, and \r\ncontented faces! True, their agriculture is not on the most approved principles; \r\ntheir breed of cattle, sheep, and hogs, is not the best; yet withal, they are \r\nhappy, attend to their fields in summer, and visit each other, and enjoy \r\nthemselves in social communing in winter; they really seem to taste far greater \r\nhappiness, and to know how to extract from their lot a far greater share of \r\nfelicity, than those who at all times and seasons wildly strive to accumulate \r\nriches, without knowing or thinking how to spend them \r\nrationally<sup>8</sup>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>While he does present something of a caricature of the \"poor French peasant \r\nhappy with his lot in life,\" his observations of their agricultural pursuits are \r\naccurate. </p>\r\n<p>It is well known that the French-Canadian and Irish immigrants to New England \r\nin the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were major antagonists and these \r\nproblems existed in Qu&#233;bec as well. Passage to Canada was much cheaper than \r\npassage to the United States, and many Irish emigrants came there before \r\npermanently settling in the United States. Alexander discusses some of the \r\nproblems between them: </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>But Irish emigrants ought to be kept at a distance from the French Canadians. \r\nThe Scotch and English commonly proceed at once to Upper Canada, or to the \r\neastern townships, but the Irish sit on the skirts of the habitans. Thus, in \r\nriding out in the country I frequently witnessed a Canadian peasant returning \r\nfrom market, with the poultry, cheese, or vegetables he had taken into town to \r\ndispose of, and with a scowl on his countenance retracing his steps homewards. \r\nThe cause of his discontent was simply this: --The Irish now crowd the markets \r\nin Lower Canada: at first they ask the same prices as the habitans, but being, \r\nas usual, \"from hand to mouth,\" they speedily reduce their price, and take \r\nwhatever the can get for their pork, butter, eggs, &amp;c.; and they can afford \r\nto take a low price for their commodities, for in Canada, as in Ireland, they \r\nhuddle together filthily in single rooms, each corner being occupied by a \r\nfamily; they therefore save fuel and house-rent, whilst the habitans live at \r\nmuch more expense, but respectably<sup>9</sup>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Hall includes some letters from settlers in the newly opened areas that \r\ndiscuss their experiences there. The following was written by a man concerning \r\nhis arrival with his family to their new home in the wilds of Ontario: </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>Having arranged our bedding and the younger children on the sleigh, we \r\nproceeded; the snow nearly knee-deep, and for the last two miles in darkness; so \r\nthat we were right glad to see the cheerful light of a good fire shining through \r\nour log-hut windows. Here my sister and most of her family met us to welcome us \r\nto the woods. Our house appeared large and wild, as, from the difficulty of \r\nprocuring boards at the-saw mill, there was not a single partition in ours put \r\nup; even on the floors, the boards were scarcely sufficient to prevent the \r\nchildren's feet from going through. When we set about to prepare our beds, we \r\nfound the floor covered above an inch thick with ice, of which we removed as \r\nmuch as we could with axes and spades, and then put a layer of chips and \r\nshavings, upon which we spread our mattresses and blankets; then having hung up \r\nsome blankets at the doors, and also for partitions, we lay down to rest, being \r\npretty well fatigued; and upon looking upwards from our beds, we saw the sky \r\nthrough the roof; and have often, during the time we lay in that manner, amused \r\nourselves watching the stars passing, and others \r\nappearing<sup>10</sup>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>How clearly this passage brings an image to mind of this newly arrived family \r\non the frontier. In another passage he describes this scene in Lower Canada \r\n(Qu&#233;bec): </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>But if the natural beauties disappointed us, the smiling works of man, and \r\nthe still more smiling looks of the black-eyed French-looking women, and the \r\nnice clean, lively children, with great broad straw hats, delighted us all the \r\nway from Quebec to St Anne's--a distance of twenty-five or thirty miles through \r\na country very densely peopled, where the houses lie close to the road--each \r\nwith its narrow strip of cultivation behind it, fenced off in parallel lines. \r\nNothing we had yet seen in America could pretend to rival these white-washed \r\ncottages, capped with sharp-pointed tin-covered roofs, all very fantastic and \r\nold-fashioned. The lintels of the doors and the sills and sides of the windows, \r\nalso, were painted black, with steps or tiers of flower-pots ranged along them, \r\nbehind the railings matted with creepers in full blossom, so as to make us feel \r\nas if we were in Italy or in the south of France<sup>11</sup>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>One immediate drawback to using travelogues is that most of them are \r\nunindexed. Many of them do not even have a table of contents, although it is \r\nquite common to see a listing of a chapter's contents at its beginning. Many of \r\nthem were undertaken for specific reasons, such as to extol the virtues of a \r\nparticular area to encourage emigration to that area. Furthermore, the \r\ntravelogues are filled with caricatures and stereotypes. Despite their \r\nshortcomings, though, they are a wonderful resource. While they do take a bit \r\nmore time to use than computerized databases, compiled indexes, and the like, \r\nthe rewards are great. The ability to really see the lives of our ancestors as \r\nthey lived it is powerful. I hope you will take the time to use them. I believe \r\nthat Hall sums this up quite nicely near the end of his book when he says: </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>For my part, I have found by experience, that as it is not possible to see \r\nevery thing that is worth seeing in a foreign country, any more than it is \r\npossible to read every book which is worth studying in a library, there is \r\ngenerally more eventual profit in viewing a few things well, than in running \r\nover a great number slightly<sup>12</sup>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>Isaac Weld Jr., <em>Travels through the States of North America and the \r\nProvinces of Upper and Lower Canada, during the Years 1795, 1796, and 1797,</em> \r\n4th ed.

Leclerc", "country": "Canada", "title": "Using Manuscript Collections in Your Research", "content": "<p>There are many jewels to be found in rare book and manuscript collections. \r\nOne vastly important difference between rare books and manuscript collections is \r\nthat rare books are generally published materials while manuscript collections \r\nusually are unpublished. It is not uncommon, however, to find in a manuscript \r\ncollection an author's research materials that he or she then used to publish a \r\nbook. NEHGS has many such collections. The wonderful thing about manuscript \r\ncollections is that you never know what you will find in them. I have seen \r\neverything from notes on families carefully written in <em>Register </em>format \r\nto scraps of information written on the backs of envelopes. While many \r\ncollections may have indexes, it is more common to find them not indexed. At \r\nmost, a finding aid or inventory will be prepared to locate different parts of \r\nlarge collections. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>Manuscripts need not be dusty old papers either. Some manuscript collections \r\ninclude carefully prepared charts and family histories printed on computer in \r\nthe last decade. Cemetery transcriptions, church records, vital records, and \r\nphotographs can all be found. Captains' logs, broadsides, heraldic drawings, and \r\nother materials are also there. The NEHGS collection contains over 3,500 linear \r\nfeet of manuscripts. Among the more interesting pieces of our collection are an \r\noriginal census book from Norfolk County, Massachusetts in 1840 and the history \r\nof a small Central Massachusetts town written in the 1860s that contains graphic \r\nopinions of the inhabitants' character from the author's perspective. The \r\nfollowing examples from the NEHGS collection will give you some idea of what \r\nawaits you in these boxes and envelopes.</p>\r\n<p>In the previous column it was mentioned that many early diaries have been \r\npublished. Many additional diaries and journals that have not been published \r\nhave been donated to institutions and kept in manuscript collections. The diary \r\nof Jesse Tilson of Stoughton, Massachusetts, is a fascinating glimpse into the \r\ntaking of Fort Louisbourg from the French:</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>Thursday June ye 28th [1759] in the morning the wind was at East and it Raind \r\nat about nine o clock the wid shiftedand Blew at N: W: and upon flood tide the \r\nfrigget Drouie of from G [?] Island and we landed our cattle upon the island and \r\nI saw a great many acers of wheet, and a great many acers of peas and all the \r\nfrench were gon of the island and carried of all the housestuf and cattle and \r\nLeft their houses standing their was seven Mass houses upon the island and in \r\nsum places ye houses stood verry thick upon ye island &amp; at night they sent \r\ndown six fire ships.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The papers also include provenance showing how the diary passed from owner to \r\nowner and finally ended up at NEHGS. </p>\r\n<p>You will also find books that contain a mixture of handwritten pages, \r\ntypewritten pages, newspaper articles (both loose and pasted in), and other \r\nmaterials. The papers of William P. Brechin, M.D., of Boston contain one such \r\nbook, which is entitled <em>The History of Kings County, Nova Scotia \r\n</em>(1910). Among the many notations in the book is the following story:</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>I John Lowden of Cornwallis in Kings County do hereby confess That whereas \r\nsometime past I have rashly and inadvertently uttered and published a scandalous \r\nreport of the Rev. James Murdock importing he was disguised with liquor at the \r\ndwelling house of Mr. Samuel Starr in Cornwallis which report although I at that \r\ntime imagined from appearances might be true yet from sufficient evidence I am \r\nnow fully convinced that my suspicions of Mr. Murdock's being at that time \r\nanyways affected or disguised with liquor were false and groundless and that my \r\npublishing such a report has greatly injured Mr. Murdock's character and \r\nreputation I do therefore hereby further humbly fully and freely acknowledge and \r\nconfess my fault in publishing such <br>report and heartily beg pardon of the \r\nsaid Mr. James Murdock for the injury I have done him and of all good people who \r\nhave been offended thereby<br>John Lowden</p>\r\n<p>Signed in presence of<br>William Dickson<br>D. Sherman Denison<br>Horton \r\nMarch 24,1768<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>This is followed by a similar confession signed by Samuel Starr dated the \r\nsame day. While insightful into the characters of the individuals named, there \r\nis a problem with this. The first confession starts on the first line of the \r\npage. In the top margin was written: \"From Nova Scotia Gazetter of March 24, \r\n1768 Halifax March 31st 1768.\" Unfortunately these words are then crossed out. \r\nWas this a transcription from a newspaper account or did Mr. Brechin see the \r\noriginal letters? It is impossible to tell from the information contained in the \r\nbook, which itself appears to be a large number of disparate pages that were \r\nonce bound together. The surrounding pages are narratives of different stories \r\nand shed no light on this entry. Materials such as this are quite common in \r\nmanuscript collections. While the book's clue may give a researcher reason to \r\nfind the newspaper mentioned to see if there are more clues contained within, \r\nthe information itself must be further researched to determine its validity.</p>\r\n<p>Another benefit of manuscript collections is that they may contain references \r\nto materials that are no longer extant or whose current whereabouts is unknown. \r\nBenjamin G. Gray wrote a seven-page history of the Gray family entitled, \r\n\"Account of the Early Members of the family of Revd. B. G. Gray late of St. John \r\nN.B. deceased especially those in and from Massachusetts.\" It is dated 9 January \r\n1861, and contains information on individuals from the seventeenth and \r\neighteenth centuries. It is quite likely that the author actually knew many of \r\nthe individuals born and living in the late 1700s and thus the information \r\ncontained about them could be first-hand knowledge. In addition, the account \r\nstarts out: </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>Benjamin Gray of Boston Mass: died in 1741 or 1742: he was the eldest son, \r\nand his father the eldest son of his father. About 1738 or 9 this Benjamin Gray \r\nreceived letters from England from a favorite uncle named John Gray of \r\nWestminster informing him that he was the next heir to the title and Estate in \r\nEngland. Being however a very great famous bigotted New Light, he wrote back \r\nthat he would not quit his New Light System to be King of England: and shortly \r\nafter died, as above mentioned, without male issue. \r\n<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The above extracted from a letter of Joseph Gray, (a grand nephew of said \r\nBenjn Gray) who was born in Massachusetts, but subsequently settled in Halifax, \r\nNova Scotia, as a merchant in the firm of Proctor &amp; Gray </p>\r\n<p>A side notation shows that the letter was written 8 February 1799. It is \r\nquite conceivable that the original letter is now lost to time. If it does \r\nexist, it could be difficult or impossible to locate. It may still be in private \r\nhands. Sixty-two years after it was written, however, Benjamin Gray allows us to \r\nknow the contents of that letter and the interesting information contained \r\ntherein. If he hadn't recorded this correspondence, we may have never known \r\nabout his namesake. <br><br>Transcriptions of original records are often found \r\nin manuscript collections. Before the age of microfilm in the second half of the \r\ntwentieth century, the only way to examine original records was to travel to the \r\nrepository where they were held. Transcribing original records was a very \r\npopular pastime in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These \r\ntranscriptions allowed more people to view the information contained in the \r\noriginal records without having to travel to examine it. In the United States, \r\nmany typescripts were created by members of the National Society of the \r\nDaughters of the American Revolution. Many were also made by the Works Progress \r\nAdministration (WPA) and deposited at local libraries. Individuals, however, \r\ncreated a huge number of transcriptions that eventually made their way to the \r\nauthor's local libraries. Among the transcriptions in the NEHGS collection is a \r\ntypescript of the Township Book for Aylesford, Nova Scotia and land records of \r\nthe King's Grant in Clements, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia in 1784. One might \r\nalso find photocopies of original records such as those of the Township of \r\nLunenburg, Nova Scotia, which were given to NEHGS.</p>\r\n<p>You may wonder why anyone would want to look at transcriptions or photocopies \r\nwhen microfilm copies of original records are now so easily available. There are \r\nseveral reasons why. First, unless you live in Salt Lake City, there is a great \r\nlikelihood that the films you want to view will have to be rented. It would be \r\nnice to view a transcription of the records first to see if the information you \r\nare looking for is even in those records. If they contain nothing useful, you \r\ncould end up saving yourself a considerable amount of money. Even if microfilmed \r\ncopies of the originals are available, they may be difficult to read. Having a \r\ntranscription available that was made by viewing the actual documents may make \r\nit easier for you to read what you see on the film. Also, parts of the original \r\nrecords may have been lost or destroyed after they were transcribed but before \r\nthey were microfilmed.</p>\r\n<p>Genealogical notes on families make up the bulk of the information in the \r\nNEHGS manuscript collection. They vary in size from small folders to several \r\narchive boxes. There are handwritten sheets of paper, index cards, bound notes \r\nand odd scraps of paper, as well as some materials generated by computer. A \r\ntypical example of family records is a manuscript donated by Dorothea (Whelan) \r\nSaavedra on her Newfoundland ancestry. It is a mixture of charts, photocopies of \r\nphotographs, and narrative. In the opening paragraph, she writes, \"This is \r\nobviously the first 'rough draft' of a projected four part study of my father's \r\nfamily in Newfoundland. There are many mistakes and empty spaces which will be \r\nrectified and filled in time.\" <sup>4</sup> As is the case with many \r\nmanuscripts, there is no citation of sources, meaning that all information \r\ncontained therein would need to be confirmed through primary sources. It is, \r\nhowever, a good place to start. Especially for a place like Newfoundland where \r\nfew microfilmed records are available outside of the Province.</p>\r\n<p>How can manuscripts be located? One major resource is the <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/coll/nucmc/nucmc.html\" target=\"_new\">National Union \r\nCatalog of Manuscript Collections [NUCMC]</a>. Sponsored by the Library of \r\nCongress, NUCMC catalogs manuscript collections at many smaller repositories \r\nthat may not have the resources to publish their holdings. Larger repositories \r\noften have their catalogs on the Internet. Many institutions have also published \r\ncatalogs of their manuscript collections at different times, such as <em>The \r\nCatalog of Manuscripts of the Massachusetts Historical Society</em> (Boston, MA: \r\nG.K. Hall, 1969). </p>\r\n<p>When checking catalogs also make sure to check for limitations on access. \r\nSome collections may have restrictions stipulated by the donor. Repositories may \r\nrestrict the use of their collections in general. For example, viewing \r\nmanuscripts at NEHGS is a benefit of membership. Our manuscript collection is \r\nnot available to non-members. An institution may also enforce special handling \r\nrules, such as requiring the use of white gloves, book cradles, or pencils, \r\nAdditionally, theremay be limitations placed on the number of photocopies you \r\ncan make from any individual collection.</p>\r\n<p>Some of you may be interested in donating your own papers to a local \r\nrepository. Here are some general guidelines to follow:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ask the repository for a copy of their guidelines for donating materials. \r\nOnce you read them, follow them to the letter. Feel free to ask questions and \r\ndiscuss them with the repository staff, but remember that they have developed \r\nthese guidelines for a reason.<br></li>\r\n<li>Go through your collection and have it neatly organized. Placing it in \r\nacid-free folders is a plus, but not absolutely necessary.<br></li>\r\n<li>While an index is a wonderful thing, it is not essential. However, a finding \r\naid that shows how the collection is organized is a must.

Leclerc", "country": "Canada", "title": "Vital Records in Qu\u00e9bec", "content": "<p>Prior to the twentieth century, the churches of Qu&#233;bec recorded and held the \r\nvital records of the province. The churches were required to provide the \r\nprovincial government copies of all birth, marriage, and death records, which \r\nserve as the official vital record. These provincial copies are known as the \r\n<em>Registres d&#8217;&#233;tat civile</em>. When using microfilm copies of Qu&#233;bec church \r\nrecords, it is important to note whether you are using the <em>Registres d&#8217;&#233;tat \r\ncivile</em>, the original parish registers, or a copy of the registers. The \r\ncopies and transcriptions often do not contain all of the information from the \r\noriginal parish record. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>If you are using microfilms from the Family History Library, you are most \r\nlikely using the civil registers, not the original parish registers. The Family \r\nHistory Library Catalog classifies both the originals and the civil copies as \r\nchurch records.&#160; It is important to read the notes on the title page of any \r\ncatalog entry to discover which records you are using. </p>\r\n<p>While looking for the registers for St. Norbert d&#8217;Arthabaska, Qu&#233;bec, the \r\ntown where my grandmother was born, I found three entries: <em>Registres \r\nparioussiaux 1888-1900 Eglise Catholique Saint Norbert d&#8217;Arthabaska</em>; \r\n<em>Registres parioussiaux 1845-1884 Eglise Catholique Saint Norbert \r\nd&#8217;Arthabaska</em>; and <em>Registres parioussiaux 1845-1877 Eglise Catholique \r\nSaint Norbert d&#8217;Arthabaska</em>. The first two entries contain the words&#160; \r\n&#8220;Microfilm des originaux dans les Archives nationales du Qu&#233;bec &#224; \r\nTrois-Rivi&#232;res, Qu&#233;bec&#8221; in the notes field on the title page. This indicates \r\nthat these entries are from the civil copy of the parish registers that now \r\nresides in the Archives Nationales de Qu&#233;bec at the Trois Rivi&#232;res branch. The \r\nlast entry reads &#8220;Microfilm des originaux dans le Presbyt&#232;re de St.-Norbert,&#8221; \r\nwhich refers to the original church records still kept in the church at St. \r\nNorbert.</p>\r\n<p>There are several additional reasons why it is important to know which copy \r\nof the registers you are viewing. First, when trying to retrace your steps, it \r\nis helpful to know exactly which microfilm you are using. And when you are \r\ndealing with multiple copies of a record it is critical to ensure that you are \r\nlooking at the same document time after time. Page numbers may differ from copy \r\nto copy. Whenever an item is copied there is the possibility for error. Names \r\ncan be erroneously transcribed or omitted completely. Words that are illegible \r\nin one copy may be legible in another. One of the copies may have become damaged \r\nby water, mold, or simply by the aging process. Knowing which copy has already \r\nbeen checked will keep you from having to retrace your steps.</p>\r\n<p>One major difficulty is in determining which is the &#8220;original&#8221; copy. The \r\npriests and ministers were told only that they had to turn over a list of all \r\nbirths, marriages, and deaths in the parish during the course of the year. Some \r\npriests kept one set of books and copied them at the end of the year when all \r\nthe entries were complete. Others kept two sets of books concurrently, sending \r\none off to the government at the beginning of the next year. In this instance, \r\nwhich copy could be considered the &#8220;original&#8221;?<br><br>Corrections may have been \r\nmade to the registers where incorrect or omitted words were added when copying. \r\nIf you find a record is incomplete, make sure you check the other copy to see if \r\nthe missing information is there.</p>\r\n<p>The priests were supposed to prepare an index for the records each year. \r\nUnfortunately, some registers were either not indexed or the indexes were lost \r\nover time. The arrangement of the indexes varies from parish to parish. Some \r\npriests listed all baptisms first, then the marriages, then the burials, putting \r\neach section in alphabetical order. Here is an example of one of these indexes \r\nfrom the parish of l&#8217;Avenir. [l&#8217;Avenir 1].</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><br><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Vital Records Quebec 01\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Canadian_Family_History/quebec_vital1lg.jpg\"><img height=\"170\" border=\"0\" width=\"200\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 170px;\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Canadian_Family_History/quebec_vital1lg.jpg\" alt=\"Vital Records Quebec 01\" title=\"Vital Records Quebec 01\"></a><br><em>Click on image for large view</em></p>\r\n<p>Other times, the names were gathered together onomastically only. This means \r\nthat all names were gathered together by the first letter of the surname, but \r\nthey do not appear in strict alphabetical order.</p>\r\n<p>Another common &#8220;index&#8221; was compiled when the priest listed in chronological \r\norder the names of the subjects of the records as they appeared in the register. \r\nThey would then list the page number that the name appeared on. Sometimes the \r\npriest made columns and indicated next to the name whether the act was a \r\nmarriage, baptism for a boy, baptism for a girl, death of a male, or death of a \r\nfemale. This made it easier to compile statistical information for the parish. \r\nHere is an example of this kind of index from the parish of St. Antoine de la \r\nBaie du Febvre in Yamaska County. [St. Antoine 1835 Index].</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><br><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Vital Records Quebec 02\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Canadian_Family_History/quebec_vital2lg.jpg\"><img height=\"232\" border=\"0\" width=\"150\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 232px;\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Canadian_Family_History/quebec_vital2lg.jpg\" alt=\"Vital Records Quebec 02\" title=\"Vital Records Quebec 02\"></a><br><em>Click on image for large view</em></p>\r\n<p>Because of the strict structure of the Catholic Church, the language for \r\nbaptisms, marriages, and burials varies little from parish to parish. Sometimes \r\nthe priests used flowery language, but the major points will be immediately \r\nrecognizable after you have researched the registers for only a little while. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Here is an example of a birth/baptism entry of my grandfather, Joseph Alfred \r\nLeclerc, from the parish of St. Zepherin de Courval in Nicolet County. </p>\r\n<br><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Canadian_Family_History/quebec_vital3.jpg\" alt=\"Vital Records Quebec 03\" title=\"Vital Records Quebec 03\"></p>\r\n<p>Le quinze aout mil neuf cent douze, nous pr&#234;tre soussign&#233; avons <s>??????? \r\ndant&#233;</s> baptis&#233; Joseph Alfred , n&#233; la veille, fils legitime de Joseph Le-clerc \r\njournalier et de Regina Boisvert Central Falls Etats Unis Parrain Narcisse \r\nBoisvert, marraine Julie Dionne son &#233;pouse de Sainte Brigitte lesquelles ont \r\ndeclar&#233; ne savoir signer.

The other is \r\nthat Narcisse Boisvert and Julie Dionne were living in Ste. Brigitte. This \r\nrecord confirms my grandfather&#8217;s story that his parents were visiting his \r\nmother&#8217;s relatives at St. Zepherine when he was born, and that his grandparents \r\nserved as his godparents (a very common occurrence).&#160; His grandmother died soon \r\nafter his baptism, and the notation of Ste.

They also have a large number of materials published in the \r\nUnited Kingdom and Australia for those researching their British roots. </p>\r\n<p>In 1997, Global Genealogy started publishing a free online \r\nmagazine, titled the <em>Global Gazette</em>. All past articles are archived on \r\nthe Global Genealogy website. Articles cover all of the Canadian provinces and \r\nterritories (including the new province of Nunavut), England, France, Ireland, \r\nGermany, Scotland, Scandinavia, Wales, the United States, and continental \r\nEurope. There are also book and software reviews, as well as articles on \r\nimmigration, technology, and general tutorials. Following are just a few samples \r\nof articles and topics available: </p>\r\n<p>Tracing your &#8220;Uterine&#8221; Lines<br>Unknown Language in \r\nGenealogy<br>Recording Same Sex Relationships in Family Tree Maker <br>Extant \r\nAcadian Church Records<br>From the Outer Hebrides to Prince Edward Island<br>Who \r\nWere the Loyalists?<br>Genealogy and the Hessian Soldiers<br>Back to the Very \r\nRoot of French Ancestry<br>The Marriage Records of England and Wales<br>GEDCOM \r\nExplained </p>\r\n<p>Global Genealogy has also been very active in promoting the \r\nmovement to release the post-1901 censuses in Canada. The website includes \r\nextensive information on the history of the controversy, the most up-to-date \r\nnews on the issues, and contact information and petitions to send to officials \r\nin the Canadian government. They have also assisted APOLROD (the Association for \r\nthe Preservation for Ontario Land Registry Office Documents), an organization \r\nthat played a pivotal role in preserving the pre-1955 Land Registry Office \r\nrecords, which now reside in local repositories and the Archives of Ontario. \r\nRick and Sandra are to be commended for their major commitment to the \r\ngenealogical community. </p>\r\n<p>The sites listed in these two articles are just a small \r\nsampling of the information that is available on the Internet. <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.cyndislist.com/\">CyndisList.com</a> contains links to \r\nhundreds of additional sites that you will find quite useful in your research. \r\n</p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/web-resources-for-canadian-research-part-2/", "published": "", "id": 28}, {"author": "Michael J.

In \r\nthe past few years it has become a ubiquitous source for researchers, providing \r\naccess to a vast number of records, documents, images, and collections that have \r\nremained hidden in the past. This column is the first of a two-part series that \r\nwill examine some of the more valuable websites available to those researching \r\ntheir Canadian roots. We will begin by examining websites maintained by \r\ngovernmental agencies.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p><strong>Federal Government</strong> </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.archives.ca/\" target=\"new\">National Archives of Canada \r\n</a></p>\r\n<p>The National Archives of Canada contains materials of historical significance \r\nto the dominion of Canada. It is important to remember that Canadian \r\nconfederation occurred in 1867, almost a century later than the United States \r\nRevolution. Many documents and items relating to the period before confederation \r\nare still in the archives of the individual provinces, and you should consult \r\nwith those archives as well. </p>\r\n<p>The National Archives website is extremely informative. There is a specific \r\nsection for genealogy where you will find a frequently asked questions list for \r\nCanadian genealogical research. You will also discover a plethora of information \r\non individual source records and how to locate them. For example, there is a \r\nbasic description of vital records for each province, as well as links to the \r\nindividual provincial agencies that handle those records. </p>\r\n<p>The National Archives also has a very active microfilm loan program. You can \r\nborrow microfilms by interlibrary loan through your local public library, and \r\nhave materials from the collection sent to you. The ArchivaNet catalog contains \r\ndetailed information on the microfilm holdings of the archives, and there are \r\ncomprehensive instructions on the site for borrowing the films. </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/\" target=\"new\">The National Library of Canada \r\n</a></p>\r\n<p>The National Library of Canada in Ottawa has an enormous number of resources \r\navailable to assist you in your research. You can access these resources in a \r\nnumber of different ways. The Amicus Catalog will search a database of over \r\ntwenty-four million bibliographic citations to more than forty million items in \r\nlibraries across Canada. There is no fee or registration required to use the \r\ncatalog, which will give you access to untold hidden treasures.&#160; Most of these \r\nmaterials are available through interlibrary loan or by requesting photocopies \r\nfrom the library holding the materials. There are several other catalogs, such \r\nas the Directory of Special Collections of Research Value in Canadian Libraries, \r\nthat will also give you details on difficult to find and heretofore unknown \r\nsources. </p>\r\n<p>There is, of course, a special section devoted just to genealogists. Here you \r\nwill find information on newspapers, directories, family and community \r\nhistories, church records, cemetery transcriptions, periodicals, and government \r\npublications that will assist you in your research. The genealogy section is one \r\nof many services provided by the library. </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pch.gc.ca/\" target=\"new\">Canadian Heritage \r\n</a><br><br>Canada has always been a progressive nation. Their national \r\ngovernment includes a department solely for preserving and promoting Canadian \r\nheritage. The department is responsible for national policies and programs \r\nrelating to broadcasting, cultural industries, arts, heritage, official \r\nlanguages, Canadian identity, Canadian symbols, exchanges, multiculturalism, and \r\nsport. On this site you can learn much about the land where your ancestors came \r\nfrom as well as what is happening there today. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Provincial Governments</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/\" target=\"new\">Archives of Ontario \r\n</a></p>\r\n<p>The Archives of Ontario contains over 240,000 cubic feet of textual records, \r\n35,000 maps, 150,000 architectural drawings, 60,000 reels of microfilm, 21,000 \r\nhours of audio/video materials, and over three million photographs. It is \r\nestimated that ninety-seven to ninety-eight percent of all records in the \r\narchives exist in their original format only, with less than two and a half \r\npercent of all holdings on microfilm. In addition, the archives maintain a \r\nlibrary of over 70,000 volumes of interest to historians and genealogists. </p>\r\n<p>There is an excellent section for genealogical research that will help \r\neveryone from beginners to longtime professional researchers. It contains \r\nfinding aids helpful for locating vital records, wills, and estate files among \r\nother documents. A detailed online catalog allows you to search descriptions of \r\narchival record collections, individual files, and the organizations that \r\ncreated these records. One can also search the catalog of volumes in the \r\nlibrary. A third option searches images from the collection that are viewable \r\nthrough the website. There are separate finding aids that detail the microfilms \r\nthat are available through interlibrary loan. A list of professional researchers \r\nis available for those who would like to hire someone to conduct research for \r\nthem. </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gov.ns.ca/nsarm\" target=\"new\">Public Archives of Nova \r\nScotia </a></p>\r\n<p>The provincial archives for Nova Scotia traces its history back to 1857 when \r\nthe legislature first provided for the preservation of provincial documents. \r\nSince 1996 the Public Archives of Nova Scotia has been combined with Nova Scotia \r\nRecords Management to form Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management. Access \r\nis available to their electronic catalog on their website. PANS is working to \r\ncomplete this catalog, but in order to find all items in its holdings it is \r\nnecessary to visit the archives in person. The address, contact information, and \r\nhours of operation are listed on the website.&#160; In addition to this catalog, the \r\nsite offers access to finding aids for collections in archives all over the \r\nprovince through its Archway to the Council of Nova Scotia Archives.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>PANS has worked to make some of its own materials available on its website. \r\nCurrently there are six databases containing information on marriages, divorces, \r\npoll tax, land records, and court records. There are also virtual exhibits of \r\nitems from the collections where users can see examples of newspapers, \r\nphotographs, and documents. </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.banq.qc.ca/accueil/\" target=\"new\">Archives Nationales de Qu&#233;bec \r\n</a></p>\r\n<p>Because Qu&#233;bec was one of the first settled areas, the records in the \r\nArchives Nationals de Qu&#233;bec are some of the oldest available in the country.&#160; \r\nThe archives were created in 1920 and Pierre-Georges Roy, one of the most \r\nimportant figures in French-Canadian genealogy, was appointed the first \r\narchivist. Roy was responsible for publishing thousands of records from the \r\nholdings of the archives. The archives holds over 40 miles of documents, 12,000 \r\nreels of microfilm, 45,000 microfiches, 53,000 hours of audio/video materials, \r\n800,000 maps and plans, and seven million photographs and images. </p>\r\n<p>This website allows you to search the catalog for details on some of the \r\nholdings. It will also tell you which of the nine regional branches of the \r\narchives the materials are held at. Contact information, addresses, and \r\noperating hours are included for each of the branches. </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://archives.gnb.ca/Archives\" target=\"new\">Provincial Archives of \r\nNew Brunswick </a></p>\r\n<p>One of the most valuable of all governmental websites for Canada is that of \r\nthe Provincial Archives of New Brunswick. PANB was founded in 1967 and holds \r\nrecords dating back to the founding of the province in 1784. Some records date \r\nback as early as the Acadian settlements of the seventeenth century. </p>\r\n<p>Over the past few years, PANB has been busy converting many of its indexes to \r\nelectronic format and making them available for research on their website. Vital \r\nrecords registration began fairly late in New Brunswick, but many indexes have \r\nbeen digitized including: </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Index to Late Registrations of Births, 1810-1906 \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Index to Late Registrations: County Series, 1869-1901 \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Index to County Birth Registers, 1801-1899 \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Index to New Brunswick Marriages, 1887-1926 \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Index to Death Certificates, 1920-1951 </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>They are working on adding indexes to earlier death records, and the indexes \r\nfor Kent and Northumberland counties are already available from 1888-1920. </p>\r\n<p>Other topics for which indexes are available include land records, military \r\nrecords, letters patent, and justice of the peace appointments. Also available \r\nare numerous finding aids to make better use of the collections, including vital \r\nrecords and the records of the Surveyor General of the Province. This is just \r\nthe tip of the iceberg of items available on the website. It stands as a model \r\nto other archives throughout the world for what can be done to assist \r\nresearchers in using the collections. </p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/web-resources-for-canadian-research-governmental-agencies/", "published": "", "id": 29}, {"author": "Scott Andrew Bartley", "country": "Connecticut", "title": "An Annotated Table of Contents for Bailey's Early Connecticut Marriages", "content": "<p>For people conducting research in Connecticut before 1800, Frederic W. \r\nBailey's <em>Early Connecticut Marriages as found on Ancient Church Records prior \r\nto 1800 </em>(New Haven, Conn., 1896-1906) is an excellent source to check. It \r\ncan be a vexing experience, however. The original work was a series of seven \r\nsmall volumes. The various reprints have only combined the seven individual \r\nvolumes into one volume. The arrangement was arbitrary. If you wanted to search \r\na particular town, you had to look in all seven volumes. This table of contents \r\nwas created to help the researcher quickly locate all the church records covered \r\nby Bailey. It also includes the churches for which he found no surviving records \r\nand the towns he did not cover (then the date the town was established is \r\ngiven). An added feature is to cross-reference the \"old\" town where the church \r\nwas located before its present town was created.<br><br>The first six volumes of \r\nBailey's work are the Congregational Church records for the state. Some are also \r\nin volume seven with the Episcopal churches. The years listed are for the \r\nsurviving records published in Bailey's work and not the dates of the church. \r\nThe formation of the church usually is many years before the earliest record. \r\nEvery attempt has been made to identify the geographic locations of each church \r\nas towns are divided into other towns. Villages are listed in a few cases and \r\nsome records technically within Massachusetts at the time. The listing of lost \r\nchurch records is also included here as a note in italic in parentheses. Each \r\nchurch's records are in chronological order in Bailey's work unless mentioned \r\notherwise.<br><br>This has been reprinted as seven volumes in one by the \r\nGenealogical Publishing Company of Baltimore in 1968, 1976, 1982, and 1997. \r\nThese reprints (except for the 1982) do not contain the errata that were mixed \r\nin with the advertisement at the end of each original volume. The reprint may be \r\nthe source for the new (2002) CD that indexes Bailey's work that is a \r\nsingle-user version of the web-based database, both by Ancestry.com. These \r\nelectronic sources have transcription errors relating to the name of the church. \r\nSee the <em>New England Historical and Genealogical Register</em>, 156 [2002]: \r\n394, for a review of the electronic sources.<br><br><em>Scott Andrew Bartley, \r\nBoston, Mass., 2002</em></p>\r\n<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p><strong>A - M</strong></p>\r\n<p>Abington Dist.

The index will \r\nrefer the reader to the terse town abbreviation, in this case ROX or \r\nRoxbury.<br><br>Thus, Oronoque is cited to INDIAN and STRA, and Oronoke to WTBY. \r\nActually, in looking under the Indian Names section, we find not just Oronoque \r\nbut Oronoke and several various spellings of the same Quinnipiac version of the \r\nAlgonquin name for \"curved place in the river.\" The towns listed in the Indian \r\nNames section with regions called Oronoque and its equivalents include RID, \r\nSTRA, WTBY and WDBY, that is, Ridgefield, Stratford, Waterbury, and \r\nWoodbury.<br><br>This book is quite useful to those confronted by the more \r\nobscure locations given in old letters, deeds, and wills.

This column introduces our \r\ndiscussion of town-wide genealogies. The discussion will cover some important \r\nissues to keep in mind when using this genre to fill in your pedigree. The \r\ncolumn looks more carefully at the books by Donald Lines Jacobus. Finally it \r\nlists the genealogies developed for the towns founded in the seventeenth century \r\nin Connecticut.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p><strong>Town-Wide Genealogies, an \r\nIntroduction</strong><br>Once you have \r\nyour research back to the Revolutionary War era, there is a high probability \r\nthat you can rapidly fill out a large slice of your pedigree using Connecticut's \r\ntown-wide genealogies. Of course, secondary sources like these are of differing \r\nlevels of reliability. You might fill in your pedigree using these books, but be \r\nsure to use pencil rather than pen.</p>\r\n<p>Among the most famous authors of this genre \r\nwas Donald Lines Jacobus, who wrote books on New Haven and on early Fairfield \r\nCounty. As town-wide genealogies go, these set the standard. Not only has he \r\ncovered nearly all the earliest settlers, but he includes citations to primary \r\ndocuments.</p>\r\n<p>Samuel Orcutt and Henry Stiles are two other \r\nprolific publishers of town-wide genealogies. These men worked in an earlier era \r\nthan Jacobus, an era when citations to primary records weren't the first focus \r\nof the genealogical writer.</p>\r\n<p>Orcutt covered towns in which my ancestors \r\nlived along and near the Connecticut shoreline. These include Stratford, \r\nBridgeport, and Derby. Orcutt is very reluctant to link people of the same name \r\ntogether in a family, that is, to equate a head-of-household to a son of the \r\nsame name in an earlier family. Thus, you have to make these links on your own \r\nwhen using Orcutt to pencil in your pedigree.</p>\r\n<p>Henry R. Stiles wrote about the important \r\nConnecticut River valley towns of Wethersfield and Windsor. His books are rich \r\nresources of family information. He often takes family down to the time in which \r\nhe is working. This implies that he was often working from submissions from \r\nliving descendants.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Town-wide Genealogies, Two \r\nExamples</strong> <br>When I first began doing \r\ngenealogy, I frequently used town-wide genealogies to fill out my pedigree. In \r\nso doing, I learned from my own mistakes a few of the ins-and-outs of using the \r\ngenre. My ancestors lived in the areas treated by Donald Lines Jacobus in his \r\ntwo major works, <em>Families of Ancient New Haven</em> and <em>History and \r\nGenealogy of the Families of Old Fairfield</em>. The New Haven book is nearly all \r\nbased on the research of Jacobus, and rates as the best town-wide genealogy I've \r\never used.</p>\r\n<p>The Fairfield book is compiled and edited by \r\nJacobus. In the first paragraph of his introduction, he provides the start and \r\nfinish dates of the project for Volume I. These dates are May 22, 1929 and \r\nNovember 27, 1929 - six months and five days in total. Jacobus discusses the \r\nschedule in the first paragraph of the introduction which surely must be a \r\nwarning to the reader and researcher. Jacobus often names the submitter of \r\nfamily information in those cases where such information might include dates \r\nfrom sources that he himself could not check, such as baptisms in \r\nEngland.</p>\r\n<p>One nice thing about the Fairfield book is \r\nthat Jacobus evidently made extensive use of land and probate records in \r\nchecking out the earliest generations. He mentions dates and events, although he \r\ndoes not provide volume and page citations for town land deeds or probate \r\ndistrict records.</p>\r\n<p>The focus of the Fairfield work changes from \r\nthe first volume to the second pair of volumes. The first volume looks at the \r\nearliest families in the county of Fairfield. The second and third volume add on \r\nto the families living within the original town of Fairfield only.</p>\r\n<p>Here are a few things to look for as \r\npossible sources of incomplete information or error: </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li><em>The family lived part of the time in a \r\ntown outside the scope of the book</em> . \r\nThis was true in the case of the family of Joseph(2) Darwin, which lived in \r\nBranford and Litchfield as well as Wallingford, a town included in the New Haven \r\nbook. Jacobus had only covered the events which are recorded in Wallingford \r\nvital records. This means that he missed the children born in Branford and the \r\nwife's death in Litchfield, as well as the marriage found only in probate \r\nrecords in Wallingford<sup>1</sup>. </li>\r\n<li><em>Jacobus places a child in a family \r\nwithout a citation to his source record</em>. This is often a signal that the name came from a \r\nprinted genealogy. Jacobus did not include citations to family histories even \r\nwhen he used them. The absence of citations is thus your signal that the \r\ninformation came from a secondary source. </li>\r\n<li><em>In the New Haven book, Jacobus does not \r\ncite probate records or land deeds</em>. \r\nIt's quite likely that he was aware of much of this information, but the lack of \r\na citation could also point to one of these record sources. </li>\r\n<li><em>In the Fairfield book, Jacobus did not \r\ncite his use of vital records</em>. Then, \r\nagain, not so many of these records still exist for Fairfield County \r\ntowns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Town-wide Genealogies, A List of Books on Seventeenth Century \r\nTowns </strong></p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li><strong>Branford</strong>: See New Haven and Guilford. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Derby</strong>: Rev.

Both men were \r\nimportant ministers in the Puritan movement. Church records from those \r\nearly times until recently -- particularly Congregational Church records\r\n -- are a rich source of genealogical information. Connecticut was \r\ncreated by Congregationalists especially to incorporate their worldview.\r\n </span></p>\r\n<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"> <p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">The Puritan viewpoint \r\nalso drove many of the concerns of the legislature. The legislature, for\r\n example, was able to control church growth. A church couldn't be \r\ngathered unless it had permission from the legislature and the \r\nsurrounding churches. Each church raised taxes for its minister from all\r\n residents in the town, church members or not. The intertwined nature of\r\n church and state was informal. The Fundamental Orders, which served as \r\nthe first constitution of the colony, actually mandated that the church \r\nand the state government would go about their business independently.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Connecticut's history until 1818 \r\nwas closely entwined with that of the Congregational Church. It was only\r\n at that late date, long after the United States Bill of Rights \r\nseparated church and state, that Connecticut's Congregational Church was\r\n disestablished by a new state constitution. Until then, the Act of \r\nToleration of 1708 prevailed. This act permitted those people who were \r\nnot Congregationalists to so declare themselves. They could then attend \r\nservices of their own churches, but they still had to pay taxes to \r\nsupport the Congregational minister. Beginning in 1727, Episcopalians \r\ncould opt out of taxes and Baptists and Quakers could do so starting in \r\n1729. In spite of this toleration of other religious views, until 1818 \r\nConnecticut residents still had to pay taxes to support Congregational \r\nministers unless they could prove they were supporting other ministers.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Other Protestant churches did make\r\n in-roads in Connecticut. The first Anglican (today Episcopalian) church\r\n was established at Stratford in 1707. The first Methodist Episcopal \r\n(today Methodist) missionary appeared in Connecticut in 1767. The first \r\nBaptist church was established in Groton in 1704. Although Scottish \r\nministers were found in early Congregational churches, the first church \r\nestablished as a Presbyterian church was founded in 1839 in \r\nThompsonville. Unitarianism was also espoused by some ministers within \r\nthe Congregational churches, but it wasn't until Brooklyn's church voted\r\n to become Unitarian and evict the Congregationalists that the group had\r\n a foothold in Connecticut. A Universalist society was organized in 1792\r\n in Southington. The early Quakers in Connecticut were a part of Annual \r\nMeetings in New York and Rhode Island. The Catholic Church appointed its\r\n first pastor to Connecticut in 1829 and later saw great growth with the\r\n immigrations of the 1880s.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Today Connecticut is a fully pluralistic society. There are many\r\n religious faiths and many institutions to support them. In fact, a full\r\n discussion of church and synagogue records in Connecticut is beyond the\r\n scope of this column, which will serve as a brief guide to the records \r\nleft by the established Congregational Church.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Where to Find Church Records</span></strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><br>Because the Congregational Church was \r\nessentially a state church until 1818, its earliest records are, for the\r\n most part, deposited at the <a href=\"http://www.cslib.org/\" target=\"new\">Connecticut State Library</a> (CSL). Where the state \r\nlibrary lacks the original record, it often has a photocopy of records \r\nstored elsewhere. Microfilm copies of these records are available at CSL\r\n or through <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\" target=\"new\">Family \r\nHistory Centers</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Not\r\n every church had a record book to microfilm. And not every church \r\nfollowed the decree to submit their record books to the Hartford \r\nfacility. For example, the Thompson Congregational Church kept its book.\r\n The church later brought the book to the Utah Genealogical Society's \r\nmicrofilm team [then in New Hampshire] to be filmed. No microfilm copy \r\nof the Thompson book is available at CSL, only a later transcription of \r\nsome events. However, a team is now working on indexing those events in \r\nthe church book that are not included in the Thompson vital records. \r\nThis will be published in a future issue of the <em>Register</em>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span id='1&amp;sku=bdti\"'>Early Connecticut Marriages as Found on \r\nAncient Church Records Prior to 1800. The records of each church are \r\narranged chronologically. The marriages covered in this book also appear\r\n in the International Genealogical Index (IGI).</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">The Church Records Slip Index</span></strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><br>Records of some Connecticut churches \r\nhave been indexed and combined into one large statewide index. CSL \r\nestimates that about one-quarter of its church records are included in \r\nthe statewide church records index, which includes other materials as \r\nwell. There are \"private records\" held by the Connecticut State Library.\r\n These records include Bible records and journals kept by residents and \r\ncovering events on a town-wide basis. The church records slip index is \r\nalso available at NEHGS and at Family History Centers on microfilm. The \r\noriginal slips are at CSL. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">The slip index covers only the following churches.

"Connecticut Microfilms at NEHGS, Part 2", "content": "<p>This is the second installment of my discussion on the microtext \r\nrecords for Connecticut research available at the NEHGS Research \r\nLibrary. Part one covered vital records and gravestone inscriptions. \r\nThis column will cover the general index to probate records and the \r\nprobate packages as well as the Connecticut Military Census, and those \r\nbits of Connecticut treated in the Corbin and Cooke collections. All of \r\nthe microtext covered in this article can be found on the fourth floor \r\nmicrotext room in the NEHGS Library in Boston.</p>\r\n <p><strong>The General \r\nIndex to Probate Records - (F93/C69)</strong></p>\r\n <p>This is a card index \r\nthat resides in the hallway of the History and Genealogy Unit at the \r\nConnecticut State Library. It covers probate packages deposited at the \r\nstate archives by local probate judges. These packages have been \r\nmicrofilmed and are also available at NEHGS.</p>\r\n <p>Each index card \r\ncontains the name of the deceased, his or her town of residence, the \r\nyear the probate file was opened, the name of the probate district in \r\nwhich the case is filed, the docket number, and information on just what\r\n types of documents are in the file Each probate package folder includes\r\n a cover sheet listing the number and types of documents included. An \r\nexample might be a probate package that includes 1 Will, 1 Inventory, 2 \r\nAccounts, 1 Bond, etc. </p>\r\n <p><strong>Probate Packages to 1880 - (F93/C69)</strong></p>\r\n<p>The probate packages are the loose papers associated with an estate \r\nfiling. The loose papers often include the original will, bonds, \r\naccounts, distributions, and receipts. They are arranged in order by \r\nprobate district, then by docket number within each probate district. </p>\r\n<p>The docket numbers roughly correspond to an alphabetic sequence with\r\n the exception of guardianships. Guardianships for a family of children \r\nare often filed under one child's name. The docket number could either \r\nfollow the deceased parent's number or it could turn up under the \r\nchild's name. Fortunately, this should not be confusing because docket \r\ncards were filed under each child's name referencing the docket number \r\nunder which the paperwork is actually filed.</p>\r\n <p>Not every probate \r\ndistrict in Connecticut was included in the microfilming of these files.\r\n Districts that did not contribute their older files to the state \r\narchives were excluded. Missing from the sequence are a few very old \r\ndistricts, such as Greenwich and Stamford.</p>\r\n <p><strong>Probate Packages \r\n1881-1915</strong></p>\r\n <p>This second round of microfilming is not yet \r\ncomplete. The NEHGS Library currently has films only through to the New \r\nHaven Probate District.</p>\r\n <p><strong>Connecticut Military Census, 1917-1918\r\n - (F96/C66)</strong></p>\r\n <p>This little gem was a special census made in \r\norder to ready America for entry into World War I by compiling personal \r\ninformation to be used by draft boards. Every man in Connecticut between\r\n the ages of 16 and 38 had to fill in one of these forms. Thus, if you \r\nhave a male ancestor or relative born between 1879 and 1901, you should \r\nbe able to find information on him here.</p>\r\n <p>The single-page form \r\ncontains identifying information on top followed by a checklist \r\nquestionnaire detailing job skills that might be pertinent. For example,\r\n from his check-offs, I learn that my grandfather was not able to drive \r\neither a team of horses or an automobile. After all, he was a city boy \r\nliving in Bridgeport. However, he had attended a business school. Later,\r\n this particular set of skills made him a bookkeeper in Pershing's \r\nheadquarters. He was 5'10\" tall, 148 lbs., and had brown eyes and blond \r\nhair. </p>\r\n <p>There are two sets of microfilm reels that comprise the \r\nConnecticut Military Census. The first is on 16-mm reels and is an \r\nindex. The second is on 32-mm reels and contains the actual census \r\nreturns.</p>\r\n <p>The index is arranged by town and alphabetical by name \r\nwithin each town. So, to get started with the Connecticut Military \r\nCensus, you need to know the town in which your ancestor lived in \r\n1917-1918. Each index entry is a card that includes the number of the \r\ncensus form that person filled out. With this information in hand, you \r\ncan consult the forms themselves. The 32-mm forms films are in order by \r\nform number.</p>\r\n <p>The little-known Nurses Census is filed separately \r\nunder LOC number F93/C67.</p>\r\n <p><strong>Connecticut Towns in the Rollin H. \r\nCooke Collection - (F72/B5/C66s)</strong></p>\r\n <p>The Rollin H. Cooke \r\nCollection consists of 66 volumes of typescript produced by the Works \r\nProgress Administration (WPA) from the manuscripts of Mr. Cooke, a \r\nbanker and genealogist from Pittsfield, Massachusetts. While the works \r\nfocus mainly on Berkshire County, Massachusetts, Cooke did include some \r\nConnecticut records in his original ledgers.</p>\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>Barkhamsted, \r\nCongregational Church Records, 1794-1850, reel 49 </li>\r\n<li>Canton, \r\nGenealogical Records, 1740-1850, reel 51 </li>\r\n<li>East and West \r\nHartland, Congregational Church Records, 1762-1880, reel 55 </li>\r\n<li>East\r\n Windsor, Cemetery Records, 1730-1805, reel 59 </li>\r\n<li>Hartford, \r\nStanley Collection of Death Records, 1790-1840, reel 54 </li>\r\n<li>Middle\r\n Haddam, Congregational Church Records, 1740-1800, reel 53 </li>\r\n<li>North\r\n Granby, Church Records, 1794-1843, reel 52 </li>\r\n<li>Salisbury, \r\nCongregational Church Records, 1740-1891, reel 56 </li>\r\n<li>Turkey \r\nHills, Church Records, 1776-1860, reel 58 </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n <p><strong>Connecticut \r\nTowns in the Walter E.

Perhaps your ancestor worked in a textile \r\nmill in Manchester or Willimantic or fished in Long Island Sound. \r\nInterviews with others who worked in those occupations will tell you \r\nwhat that work was like. Was grandma a union activist? Learn about the \r\nexperiences of other Connecticut women activists from their interviews. </p>\r\n<p>Historians in Connecticut, particularly at the \r\nUniversity of Connecticut, have pioneered and led the way in the \r\ndevelopment and completion of a variety of oral history projects. They \r\nhave received recognition on local, state, and national levels and have \r\nbeen prominent in oral history associations in New England and beyond. \r\nWhile a resident of Connecticut I participated in several oral history \r\nprojects administered by the University of Connecticut Oral History \r\nProject and funded by the Connecticut Humanities Council. In the early \r\n1980s, another historian and I spent over a year tracking down and \r\ninterviewing twenty-one elderly Connecticut women who had been \r\npolitically active from the early 1900s to the mid-1930s. We asked them \r\nabout their occupations and political activities, information of \r\npotential interest to anyone with a female family member who was \r\ninvolved in political life in Connecticut early in the century. Another \r\nproject I worked on during the 1980s involved interviewing elderly men \r\nwho had spent their lives fishing on Long Island Sound from very \r\ntraditional wooden sailboats. They described an occupation and way of \r\nlife that have since disappeared. These interviews are available at the \r\nUniversity of Connecticut Thomas J Dodd Research Center in Storrs and at\r\n the Connecticut Humanities Council in Middletown. </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ucc.uconn.edu/%7Ecohadm01/catalog.html\" target=\"new\"><strong>University\r\n of Connecticut Center for Oral History </strong></a></p>\r\n<p>The Oral History Project of the History Department at \r\nthe University of Connecticut, organized in 1968, was the pioneer in the\r\n field. It became the University of Connecticut Center for Oral History \r\nin 1981. Through TAPESCRIBE, their professional transcribing service, \r\nthe center has assisted many oral historians to transcribe the spoken \r\nword into the more easily used and distributed written form. </p>\r\n<p>The UConn project includes more than 900 oral history \r\ninterviews. On their website you will find a <a href=\"http://www.ucc.uconn.edu/%7Ecohadm01/catalog.html\" target=\"new\">list\r\n of their projects </a>, followed by a list of interviewees for each \r\nproject and the number of pages in each interview. Many interviews are \r\nof potential interest to genealogists. The majority of early interviews \r\nwere with elderly individuals who could recall life at the end of the \r\nnineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. Among them are \r\ninterviews with mill workers, tobacco workers, sailors, Connecticut \r\nSocialists and Communists, and survivors of the Holocaust who later \r\nlived in the state. The Peoples of Connecticut project includes \r\ninterviews of African-Americans, French-Canadians, Irish, Italian, \r\nJewish, Polish, Puerto Ricans, and individuals of various European \r\nethnic origins. </p>\r\n<p>Unless the interviewee \r\nrestricted use of an interview, researchers have access to both \r\naudiotapes and transcripts of interviews at the Thomas J. Dodd Research \r\nCenter, University of Connecticut at Storrs. </p>\r\n<p>Also\r\n available at the Dodd Research Center is the Italians in New London \r\nOral History Project of 1997-98 wherein forty-four longtime \r\nItalian-American residents of New London described their life in that \r\ncity on videotape. </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mysticseaport.org/\" target=\"new\"><strong>Stonington \r\nFishing Oral History Project at Mystic Seaport </strong></a></p>\r\n<p>The focus of this project was on the lives of \r\nfisherman, their families, and other workers in the commercial fishing \r\nindustry of the Mystic-Stonington area during the twentieth century. \r\nInterviews with photographic illustrations are available at the Mystic \r\nSeaport Library in Mystic. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Manchester and \r\nCheney Silk Mills Oral History Project</strong></p>\r\n<p>For \r\ninformation call: Manchester Historical Society (860) 647-9983 </p>\r\n<p>During the 1970s and 1980s history professor John \r\nSutherland of Manchester Community College and his students interviewed \r\nabout ninety elderly Manchester residents, many of whom had worked at \r\nthe Cheney Brothers Silk Mills. In some cases they were the second \r\ngeneration of their family to have done so. The focus of the project was\r\n to trace about one hundred years of Manchester history (1880s-1980s) \r\nthrough interviews that revolved around working class life, immigrant \r\nlife, and the Cheney Silk Mills. Anyone who had ancestors living in \r\nManchester during that time would find valuable information about \r\nresidents&#8217; lives and working conditions at the mills. Tapes of these \r\ninterviews are currently being transcribed and these transcriptions, as \r\nwell as the tapes, will be available at the Manchester Historical \r\nSociety in the near future. </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.greenwich.lib.ct.us/\" target=\"new\"><strong>Greenwich \r\nLibrary Oral History Project </strong></a></p>\r\n<p>For a\r\n list of interviews, click on the link above, then choose &#8220; Library \r\nCatalog,&#8221; then &#8220;Library Catalog on the Web, &#8221;then &#8220;Library Catalog: \r\nSubject: [type in] Greenwich, CT.&#8212;Biography&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>Friends\r\n of the Greenwich Library sponsor the second largest oral history \r\nproject in Connecticut.

The taped and transcribed interviews are \r\nof individuals who, since the 1890s, have contributed to or witnessed \r\nthe making of Greenwich history. <br><br>Of the more than 600 \r\ninterviews, about 125 thought to be of widest interest have been \r\npublished in book form with indexes and illustrations. Tapes and \r\ntranscriptions of all interviews are available at the Greenwich Library \r\nand those published in book form may be obtained through interlibrary \r\nloan. </p>\r\n<p>The focus of some interviews is on life \r\nin various Greenwich neighborhoods or villages beginning in the 1890s: \r\nOld Greenwich, Belle Haven, Mead Point, Mianus, Byram, Riverside, Sound \r\nBeach, Cos Cob, Old Greenwich, and Banksville. Greenwich occupations \r\nsuch as oystering, fire fighting, newspaper publishing, and public \r\nhealth nursing are included. The experiences of African American and \r\nJewish residents are recounted in other interviews. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Public Libraries and Local Historical Societies</strong></p>\r\n<p>Many town libraries and historical societies have \r\nsmall oral history projects that focus on interviews with longtime town \r\nresidents. Due to lack of funding, transcriptions may not be available.&#160;\r\n So be prepared to listen or watch taped interviews. You can learn about\r\n the majority of these interviews by contacting both the library and \r\nhistorical society in the town of interest and asking for a list of \r\ntheir oral history interviews. </p>\r\n<p>If it is not \r\ntoo late to interview your Connecticut ancestors, dust off your tape \r\nrecorder and make a date!

There are several indexes \r\nand approaches you can use to locate the records you need.<br><br>Note \r\nthat this location may not always be the town in which the person was \r\nresiding. For example, the town of Roxbury, Connecticut, is quite small \r\nand has no hospital. Roxbury residents thus have a tendency to \r\nexperience birth and death at the nearest hospital, which is in New \r\nMilford, Connecticut.<br><br>Birth records are copied to the towns of \r\nresidence of the parents. This is not the case with deaths and \r\nmarriages. Fortunately, there are other avenues to discover the location\r\n of a death.

Many genealogical lineage \r\nsocieties accept printouts or photocopies of the Barbour slip index or \r\ntown index books as readily as certified birth records. The Barbour \r\nindex is now the subject of an ongoing publication effort by Lorraine \r\nCook White through the Genealogical Publishing Company. So far 18 \r\nmulti-town volumes have been published in alphabetic order (through \r\nHebron).<br><br><em>A Note on the Barbour Index: It was compiled largely \r\nfrom transcriptions of local vital records and never compared against \r\nthe original town record books. In some towns, such as Newtown, this has\r\n resulted in poor or missing records. Other towns, such as Guilford, did\r\n not have all records available at the time of transcription. Guilford&#8217;s\r\n first book of vital records is not included in the Barbour index. For \r\nearly Guilford events, please check volumes 15, 16, and 17 of </em>TAG.<br><br>When\r\n using the Connecticut Death Index at Ancestry. com, please be aware \r\nthat record sorting is not perfect by either date or name. For example, \r\nmy grandmother Adelaide Mathews died 10 January 1978, and my grandfather\r\n William Mathews died 28 January 1981, both in New Milford Hospital. As \r\ntheir granddaughter, I have copies from the state vital records office \r\nof both death records. A search on Ancestry. com for Adelaide&#8217;s death \r\ndid not yield a record in the state index. The answers based on \r\n&#8220;Mathews&#8221; were rudely sorted by year, but 1980 and 1981 were filed at \r\nthe end of 1987, so only at the end of the list did I find William&#8217;s \r\ndeath. Only a completely thorough search will yield results here.<br><br>To\r\n search further for Adelaide Mathews, I used the Social Security Death \r\nIndexes at Family Tree and at Ancestry. com. Both supplied her date of \r\ndeath, and showed her place of residence as Roxbury. Only one, that at \r\nFamily Tree, supplied the last place a payment was sent, which was New \r\nMilford. This element of information would have led me to the death \r\nrecord&#8217;s location in that town.<br><br><strong>How to Order Vital Records</strong><br><br>Vital\r\n records cost $5 whether birth, marriage, or death. [The one exception \r\nto this rule is that birth records cost $15 when ordered from the state \r\nvital records office. These records, however, are not accessible at this\r\n time.] Once you know the location of the event, you need both an \r\napplication form and an address. To obtain an application form, try one \r\nof these sources:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>The application form can be downloaded or printed from the \r\nConnecticut Department of Public Health, Vital Records Section&#8217;s web \r\npage for Requests for Certificates and Town Clerk Telephone Numbers. </li>\r\n<li>Forms can be copied from the <em>International Vital Records \r\nHandbook</em> by Thomas Jay Kemp.

Vital records have been kept since earliest times and many \r\nare still extant. A search for a birth, marriage, or death record in \r\nConnecticut will often be successful.<br><br>Connecticut&#8217;s vital records\r\n access law permits genealogical researchers to see and copy all types \r\nof records down to the present day. Membership in a genealogical society\r\n that operates under Connecticut laws is a requirement in particular for\r\n access to births less than 100 years old.<br><br>The closure of the \r\nstate&#8217;s central office for vital statistics has made the search more \r\ndifficult. Without the central repository, the researcher must know the \r\ntown in which the record was generated. Fortunately for births, the \r\nrecords are copied to the town of residence of the parents. In the case \r\nof deaths, there is an index online for the years 1949-1996 (membership \r\nin Ancestry is required to access it). The Hale index to cemetery \r\ninscriptions and newspaper marriage and death notices to 1936 and the \r\nSocial Security Death Index (covering ca. 1956 to the present) serve as \r\nalternate sources of information.<br><br>Connecticut remains by far my \r\nfavorite state for research. Massive efforts by Lucius Barbour and \r\nCharles Hale produced indexes to vital records to 1850 and headstone \r\ninscriptions to 1936. The scholarship of other genealogists has produced\r\n town-wide genealogies of the highest caliber.

Discovering a maiden surname sometimes seems like a major \r\nachievement. Connecticut&#8217;s extensive collection of early public records \r\ncontains little information about individual women, and few personal \r\npapers of Connecticut women survive from the pre-Revolutionary War era. \r\nWomen of this period were for the most part poorly educated and seldom \r\nlegally permitted to own real property if married. Those women that were\r\n married often signed away their dower rights to land with a mark on the\r\n deed. Courts sometimes denied widows guardianship rights for their \r\nchildren. Few women were employed outside their homes, and those who \r\nwere could not claim and control their own earnings, which were instead \r\npaid to their fathers or husbands. Women had no formal role in and \r\nlittle influence over town government, and speaking out in public was \r\nconsidered unsuitable behavior. Take heart!

His one \r\nthousand-page medical journal begins on March 10, 1656/7 and ends on \r\nJuly 26, 1669, with a gap of two years from 1661 to 1663 when he was in \r\nEngland.</p>\r\n <p>Winthrop&#8217;s original journal, at the Massachusetts \r\nHistorical Society, is the subject of a feature article, written by \r\nRobert Charles Anderson in the <em>Great Migration Newsletter</em> (vol. \r\n9, no. 1 [Jan.-March 2000]). At the time the article was written, \r\nAnderson was transcribing the journal for future publication. Until this\r\n work is available, researchers can refer to a series of articles \r\nprepared by Col. Charles E. Banks and published in <em>The American \r\nGenealogist </em>(vol. 9, pp. 54-61, 64; vol. 23, pp. 62-64, 124-128, \r\n231-34; and vol. 24, pp. 41-47, 108-15). They feature an alphabetical \r\nlisting of abstracts of journal entries containing genealogical \r\ninformation. </p>\r\n <p>Since Winthrop lived in New Haven when he began \r\nkeeping his journal, many entries refer to patients living near the \r\nConnecticut coast and even in Southampton, Long Island. He moved to \r\nHartford in 1657 and began tending to the residents of that town, as \r\nwell as the towns of Windsor, Farmington, Wethersfield, Middletown, and \r\neven Springfield.</p>\r\n <p>In his article, Robert Charles Anderson \r\nemphasizes the valuable genealogical information that relates to \r\nWinthrop&#8217;s male patients. My focus is on information about Winthrop&#8217;s \r\nfemale patients. In fact, the majority of journal entries mention female\r\n family members by name. Genealogical information includes family \r\nrelationships, ages, number and names of children, marital status, and \r\nif married, sometimes both maiden surname and husband&#8217;s name. </p>\r\n <p>I \r\nrecall my delight in finding an entry that refers to my husband&#8217;s \r\nancestor Deborah (Wathen) Joy. Her entry from Banks&#8217; abstracts indicates\r\n the abbreviated format he devised: </p>\r\n <p>JOY. p 32. Walter, his wife.\r\n Milford, 1657 (TAG 23:233). (Page numbers refer to the page in the \r\noriginal journal.) </p>\r\n <p>This short entry tells me that Walter Joy was\r\n still alive in 1657 and that his wife (and possibly Walter) was then in\r\n Milford and not Massachusetts where they previously lived. Another \r\nentry may provide genealogical information not found elsewhere: </p>\r\n <p>BROWNE.\r\n p. 726. 1667. Mary, 12 yrs., dau. of Francis of Stamford, lives with \r\nNathl Reskue of Hartford as his adopted dau. (TAG 9:59). </p>\r\n <p>In \r\nfact, Stamford vital records include only the marriage of Francis Brown \r\nand Martha Chapman on 17, 10, 1657. This raises questions about a \r\nprevious marriage for Francis Brown as well as what happened to Francis \r\nand Martha (Chapman) Brown.&#160; One may also wonder why his daughter was in\r\n Hartford with Nathaniel Reskue, a name that does not appear in Stamford\r\n records. </p>\r\n <p>Winthrop identified some of his patients as servants. \r\nFor non-English patients Winthrop usually stated ethnic background \r\n(Scottish, French, Dutch, Irish) or race (Native American or African \r\nAmerican), indicating the varied nature of Connecticut&#8217;s early \r\npopulation. Anderson estimates that several hundred patients were Native\r\n American, mainly Podunk Indians living near Hartford, and that several \r\ndozen patients were African American. </p>\r\n <p>In his <em>Great Migration \r\nNewsletter</em> article, Robert Charles Anderson cautions that in \r\naddition to abstracting only a portion of journal entries and omitting \r\nmedical diagnoses and prescriptions, Banks erroneously transcribed some \r\nwords. Until a complete transcription is available, Banks&#8217; abstracts can\r\n help researchers decide whether to consult the original journal.</p>\r\n<strong>Deviant\r\n Behavior<br></strong>Behavior considered socially deviant attracted \r\nattention in the seventeenth century as it does today. One of my \r\nfavorite publications about seventeenth-century New England women is \r\nLyle Koehler&#8217;s <em>A Search for Power, The &#8220;Weaker Sex&#8221; in \r\nSeventeenth-Century New England</em>&#160; (Urbana: University of Illinois \r\nPress, 1980). Koehler describes and then analyzes the limitations and \r\noppression women faced in their daily lives and their varied responses. A\r\n series of appendices at the end of the text provide quick reference to \r\nthe names of women whose behavior may have deviated from \r\nseventeenth-century norms. You might find your Connecticut ancestor&#8217;s \r\nname listed there!  <p>A list of petitions for divorce in New England \r\nfrom 1620 to 1699, arranged by colony, is found in Appendix 1 of \r\nKoehler&#8217;s book. Forty-seven petitions were from Connecticut residents. \r\nKoehler indicates the dates of petitions (1655-1699), names of \r\npetitioners and spouses (seventy percent of the Connecticut petitioners \r\nwere wives), causes (primarily desertion, adultery, bigamy, or \r\nimpotence), disposition of cases (nearly eighty percent of petitions \r\nwere granted), and sources of information.&#160; Residences of petitioners \r\nare not included. Two listings from 1680 are for the same Connecticut \r\ncouple. First, James Wakely petitioned for divorce from his wife Alice \r\nfor &#8220;refusal to accompany her husband to Newport.&#8221; His petition was \r\ndenied. Then Alice petitioned for divorce from James for &#8220;desertion.&#8221; \r\nThe disposition of her case is unknown.</p>\r\n <p>Only one Connecticut \r\nname, a Mrs. Guilbert of Hartford, is included in Appendix 2, &#8220;Female \r\nInnkeepers and Liquor-Sellers in New England, 1620-1699.&#8221; Appendix 4, \r\n&#8220;Suspected Killings of Children (Mostly Infants) by Their Mothers in New\r\n England, 1620-1699,&#8221; includes four Connecticut women: Ruth Briggs of \r\nNew Haven (1667), an unidentified woman from Hartford (1668), Mercy \r\nBrown of Connecticut (1690), and Amy Mun of Farmington (1699).</p>\r\n <p><strong>Witchcraft</strong><br>Names\r\n of Connecticut women accused of witchcraft from 1620 to 1699 are \r\nincluded in Appendix 5. Of the three hundred fifteen New England \r\nindividuals Koehler lists as accused, only thirty-nine were from \r\nConnecticut &#8211; twenty-six women and thirteen men. In seven Connecticut \r\ncases both husbands and wives were accused. While the majority of \r\naccusations in Massachusetts were made in early 1692, in Connecticut \r\nmost occurred in the Hartford area before 1670 or in the \r\nFairfield-Stamford area after the 1692 frenzy in Salem died down.</p>\r\n <p>A\r\n booklet by Ronald Marcus, &#8220;Elizabeth Clawson&#8230;Thou Deseruest to Dye&#8221; \r\n(Stamford: Stamford Historical Society, 1976) is an account of the June \r\n1692 Stamford trial of a woman who was accused and acquitted of being a \r\nwitch. Marcus describes in detail the accusations of a young Stamford \r\nservant, Katherine Branch, against five area women. Of special interest \r\nto genealogists with late seventeenth-century Stamford ancestors is the \r\nphotocopy and transcription of an affidavit attesting to the innocence \r\nof Elizabeth Clawson, one of the accused. Among the names of the \r\nseventy-six individuals who signed the document are the signatures or \r\nmarks of twenty-nine Stamford women, who by their courageous stand in \r\ndefense of their friend and neighbor have also proved to us that they \r\nwere living in Stamford on June 4, 1692.</p>\r\n <p>Additional sources of \r\ninformation about witchcraft cases in Connecticut include: </p>\r\n <ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Karlsen, Carol F. <em>The Devil in the Shape of a Woman,\r\n Witchcraft in Colonial New England. </em>New York: W.W.

Record Group 3 includes Superior Court records \r\nwith unusually complete files on divorce for the following counties: <br><br><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\" class=\"contentTableText\">\r\n <tbody>\r\n <tr>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p><strong>County</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p><strong>Dates</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>Fairfield</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>1711&#8211;1798</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>Hartford</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>1740&#8211;1849</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>Litchfield</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>1752&#8211;1922</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>Middlesex</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>1786&#8211;1797</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>New Haven</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>1712&#8211;1900</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>New London</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>1719&#8211;1875</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>Tolland</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>1787&#8211;1910</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>Windham</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"295\" valign=\"top\"> <p>1726&#8211;1907</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><strong><br>Town Records<br></strong>Connecticut town records contain \r\noccasional references to women. Early records of only a few towns have \r\nbeen transcribed and published. Usually it is necessary to read original\r\n records, photocopies or originals, or microfilms of the originals. \r\nAmong published town records are:</p>\r\n <ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Burr, Jean \r\nChandler. ed. and comp., <em>Lyme Records 1667</em>&#8211;<em>1730</em> \r\n(Stonington, Conn: The Pequot Press, Inc., 1968). </li>\r\n<li>Gannett, \r\nMichael R. transcriber, <em>Cornwall Documents: Town Meeting Minutes 1740</em>&#8211;<em>1875</em>\r\n (Cornwall, Conn.: Cornwall Historical Society, 1984)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n <p>The \r\nevery-name index to <em>Lyme Records 1667</em>&#8211;<em>1730</em> includes the \r\nnames of several women. For the most part, their entries concern land \r\ntransactions, property of widows that abutted proposed new town roads, \r\nand town support of poor women. A more unusual entry, dated August 16, \r\n1705, states:</p>\r\n <blockquote> <p>&#160;&#8220;At the same metting wharas Thomas \r\nLord Seiner [senior] complained of for the enteraning of a widdow Hanah \r\nBoothe lat of Long Island and after warning given by the Select men of \r\nthe Towne Still the same widow is entertained by said Lord . and to \r\nprevent any damadge I the said Thomas Lord doe by these presents bind \r\nmyself my hairs . . . exempt . . . the sume of one hundred pounds in \r\ncurrent paye&#8230;to be paid to the Towne upon any dammidge the said Towne \r\nshall sustaine by sd widdow wither for her maintinac in sickness or in \r\nhealth &#8230;Thomas Lord.&#8221;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n <p>Names of more than twenty \r\nwomen appear in the index to <em>Cornwall Documents</em>. Although while \r\nmost entries refer to issues of property or poverty, two brave Cornwall \r\nwomen, Mary Allen and Mary Horsford, signed a petition in 1757 \r\nprotesting against a town vote to increase taxes.</p>\r\n<strong>Revolutionary \r\nWar Era Records<br></strong>Two very different books, both written by \r\nhistorians, pertain to Connecticut women during the Revolutionary War \r\nera. One provides general information about the lives of Connecticut \r\nwomen of that era, while the other contains detailed information about \r\none woman&#8217;s life, family, and surroundings.  <ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Fennelly,\r\n Catherine. <em>Connecticut Women in the Revolutionary Era</em>, A \r\nPublication of the American Revolution Bientennial Commission of \r\nConnecticut (Chester, Conn.: Pequot Press, 1975). </li>\r\n<li>Buel, Joy \r\nDay and Richard Buel Jr., <em>The Way of Duty: A Woman and Her Family in \r\nRevolutionary America</em> (New York, N.Y.: W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1984).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Catherine Fennelly&#8217;s study describes various aspects of the lives of\r\n Connecticut women during the mid- and late-eighteenth century: their \r\neducation, work, health, dress, lack of legal rights, and social \r\nactivities. The last chapter covers, in detail, contributions of \r\nConnecticut women to the Revolutionary War effort, both as Patriots and \r\nas Loyalists. Although Fennelly mentions several Revolutionary War era \r\nwomen by name, she explains, &#8220;Tales of individual contributions by \r\nConnecticut women are few indeed.&#8221; Nevertheless, general information \r\nfound in this study can help build historical context for your \r\nancestor&#8217;s life story. Unfortunately, the volume lacks an index.</p>\r\n <p><em>The\r\n Way of Duty</em> is the biography of Mary Fish (1736&#8211;1818), who was born\r\n in Stonington and lived in both the New Haven area and in Fairfield \r\nCounty during her three marriages. Her biography is based on documents \r\nfrom the Silliman Papers at Yale University Library and the Noyes Papers\r\n at New Canaan Historical Society. Surviving documents include Mary \r\n(Fish) Noyes Silliman Dickinson&#8217;s correspondence, ledgers, and journals.\r\n While her life was in many ways similar to the lives of her \r\ncontemporaries, her education, character, family, and associates set her\r\n apart and enabled her to achieve an independence that eluded most \r\nConnecticut women of her era.</p>\r\n <p>Information about some (primarily \r\nwidowed) late eighteenth-century Connecticut women can be found in \r\nRevolutionary War damage claim lists, grand [tax] lists for Connecticut \r\ntowns, and the 1790 Connecticut United States Census. Analyzed together,\r\n these sources can provide considerable information about households \r\nheaded by women.</p>\r\n <p>Residents of several Connecticut towns, \r\nespecially along the coast opposite Long Island, lost personal property \r\nduring Tory raids.&#160; Soon after the Revolutionary War ended, such \r\nindividuals filed damage claims for the purpose of state tax abatement. \r\nAfter languishing in the basement of Stamford Town Hall for more than \r\none hundred fifty years, the Stamford damage claims were rediscovered \r\nand given to the Stamford Historical Society. In 1968, the Society \r\npublished the lists as <em>Stamford Revolutionary War Damage Claims</em>, \r\nedited by Ronald Marcus. Names of twenty-five Stamford women, mostly \r\nwidows, are included. Rebecca Brown, a widow and mother of a large \r\nfamily whose husband died in 1772, filed claims on&#160; December 5, 1781 for\r\n losses incurred on&#160; June 3, 1779 and during 1780 (pages 10-13). Her \r\nlong list of plundered household goods and clothing suggests the nature \r\nand extent of domestic possessions at that time, while her losses of \r\npoultry, animals, grain, farm equipment, and tools, as well as a boat \r\nand sails suggest the varied economic activities of her household. For \r\ndamage claims from other towns, check historical society manuscript \r\ncollections and the Revolutionary War Series at the Connecticut State \r\nLibrary in Hartford.</p>\r\n <p>After the Revolutionary War, Connecticut \r\nrequired towns to compile annual grand lists of residents&#8217; real and \r\npersonal property for tax purposes. Surviving town grand lists can be \r\nfound in Record Group 62 at the Connecticut State Library, at the \r\nConnecticut Historical Society, or at local historical societies. The \r\nStamford Historical Society has grand lists for most years between 1781 \r\nand 1819. Towns levied poll taxes on males of voting age. Property taxes\r\n were levied on </p>\r\n <ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>The number of oxen, cows, \r\nhorses, and swine </li>\r\n<li>The number of chimneys in the dwelling </li>\r\n<li>Various categories of land </li>\r\n<li>Personal property such as \r\nclocks, gold and silver watches, silver plate and carriages </li>\r\n<li>Occupations\r\n including attorney, tradesman, doctor, and tavern keeper </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n <p>Grand\r\n lists are especially valuable to genealogists since they include the \r\nnames of many widows who were heads of households. The name of Widow \r\nRebecca Brown can be found in the Stamford Grand List of 1781. She was \r\ntaxed on thirteen animals, two chimneys in her dwelling, and sixty-eight\r\n acres of land.</p>\r\n <p>Information about heads of households (both men \r\nand women) found in Revolutionary War damage claims lists,&#160; grand lists,\r\n and listings in the 1790 Connecticut census can be correlated with \r\ninformation from vital records to provide considerable personal data for\r\n analysis. Continuing with the example of Widow Rebecca Brown, her 1790 \r\ncensus listing in Stamford indicates that her household included four \r\nmales of sixteen years and older and three females<em> </em>(<em>Heads of \r\nFamilies at the First Census of the United States, 1790 Connecticut</em> \r\n[Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc., 1980], page 26). This \r\ninformation is consistent with information about the size of her family \r\nfound in Stamford vital records. Perhaps Tory raiders considered her \r\nproperty a prime target.&#160; A widow without a male head of household, she \r\nprobably lived near the shore (a boat and sails were taken) and may have\r\n been known to possess many valuable household items: pewterware, \r\nglassware, feather beds with sheets, pillows, coverlets, quilts and \r\nblankets, cooking utensils, axes and other tools, imported \r\nhandkerchiefs, bonnets, shifts, gowns, fans, silver buckles, jackets, \r\ncoats, hats, shirts, trousers, more than sixty yards of cloth, as well \r\nas many geese, hens, calves, horses, and sheep, and even currency, \r\nspectacles, razors, and an ink stand &#8211; all taken by Tories! The complete\r\n list of plundered items resembles an inventory and provides an intimate\r\n glimpse into the domestic circumstances of her family life. After the \r\nraids, as attested by the 1781 grand list, she had several animals, her \r\nhouse, and land, but no taxable luxury goods.</p>\r\n <p>Creative \r\ncorrelation of information from several sources can significantly \r\nincrease your knowledge and understanding of a female ancestor&#8217;s \r\nexperiences and circumstances.</p>\r\n <p>Part II in this series will focus \r\non nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Connecticut women.</p>\r\n</div></div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/connecticut-women-seventeenth-and-eighteenth-century/", "published": "", "id": 38}, {"author": "Joyce S.

Advanced and improved education became a \r\nreality and better jobs were available. Women could now own property, be\r\n guardians for their children, and receive and control their earnings. \r\nOrganization began on the community level with social, philanthropic, \r\neducational, and reform goals providing motivation. Few immigrant and \r\nminority women, however, shared in these expanded opportunities. Many \r\nwomen who moved out of their domestic routines into public roles left \r\nbehind records of their activities that can be of interest to family \r\nhistorians.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Educational opportunities for women</strong> improved after the \r\nRevolutionary War as leaders of the new republic placed greater emphasis\r\n on an educated populace. This trend expanded steadily during the \r\ncentury. Many girls, especially in rural areas, continued to attend \r\nelementary schools during the summer session only. New schools for girls\r\n were often private and urban.&#160; Educated women, usually young and single\r\n or widowed, opened small elementary schools in their homes where they \r\ntaught basic skills to local girls. Some schools featured the \r\n&#8220;ornamental branches&#8221; of fancy sewing, music, and dancing. Female \r\nacademies and seminaries offered more advanced instruction similar to \r\nthe education college-bound boys then received. Some schools boarded \r\nstudents who came from as far away as the Carolinas and Ohio. During \r\ntheir heyday, private schools in Connecticut educated thousands of girls\r\n each year. By the last decades of the century, co-educational public \r\nhigh schools were replacing private academies and seminaries. Girls who \r\nwent to work at age fourteen began to attend evening classes at public \r\nschools to further their education. </p>\r\n<p>Records from some private Connecticut schools for girls survive, \r\npossibly even from a school your ancestor(s) attended. You may find \r\nschool catalogs and yearbooks with lists of trustees, teachers, and \r\nstudents, the school curriculum, lists of alumni with addresses, school \r\nprograms naming student participants, school publications with student \r\nliterary compositions, report cards, journals, correspondence, \r\nscrapbooks, and photographs.</p>\r\n<p>In Connecticut, school records are kept at the <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.cslib.org/\">Connecticut State Library</a>,\r\n the <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.chs.org/\">Connecticut Historical \r\nSociety</a>, and other local historical society archives.

They are also sometimes published separately, as \r\nwere Stratfield (later Bridgeport) records. See <em>The Bicentennial \r\nCelebration of the First Congregational Church and Society of \r\nBridgeport, Connecticut</em> (New Haven, 1895) available at the NEHGS \r\nLibrary, the Connecticut State Library, and the Bridgeport Public \r\nLibrary for more information on these records.

Their \r\ninitial purpose was to prepare, collect, and ship supplies needed by \r\nsick or wounded soldiers. Later efforts, directed toward collecting \r\nmoney for the war effort, culminated in major fund-raising events known \r\nas Sanitary Fairs. Members also went to local train stations to nurse \r\nand feed wounded soldiers who were en route to their homes or hospitals.\r\n For Stamford, I once estimated that twenty percent of town women \r\nbelonged to the local society, an indication of the popularity of this \r\nform of wartime service.</p>\r\n<p>Local newspapers routinely featured articles about Ladies&#8217; Soldiers&#8217; \r\nAid Societies in their areas, listing names of members and group \r\nactivities, especially during 1863 and 1864, their busiest years.

To help you use it most effectively, this article tells a \r\nlittle of its history, describes where and in what format the collection\r\n can be examined, and outlines the history of vital records legislation \r\nin the state. It also lists sources for several significant omissions \r\nfrom and corrections to the collection.</p>\r\n<strong>A Brief History of the \r\nCollection</strong><p>Lucius B. Barbour was appointed Connecticut&#8217;s examiner of public \r\nrecords in June 1911. With a desire to compile the state&#8217;s vital \r\nrecords, he began transcriptions himself, and he worked with different \r\nsponsors to publish the records of several towns. The pace of this \r\napproach was impossibly slow, and he hired James N. Arnold, the compiler\r\n of Rhode Island vital records, using Barbour family funds. Arnold was \r\nto copy the vital records in the possession of each town clerk of \r\nConnecticut. By 1932 this compilation was complete, each record was \r\ntyped onto an index slip, and an alphabetical listing was prepared for \r\neach town. Sadly, Lucius B. Barbour died in 1934, just two years after \r\nthe completion of this work.</p>\r\n<strong>What&#8217;s In It and Where to Find It</strong><p>There are over one million slip entries for vital records in some 439\r\n trays at the <a href=\"http://www.cslib.org/\">Connecticut State Library</a>.\r\n Besides the core Barbour Collection itself, these slips include entries\r\n from eight towns previously published <sup>1</sup> and from six private\r\n compilations of vital records <sup>2</sup>. A copyist typed the slips \r\nfrom the handwritten transcriptions by Arnold and others. As with any \r\ntranscription, a few errors were introduced, but each entry cites the \r\nspecific source and this facilitates reference to the primary record.</p>\r\n<p>The Barbour Collection is listed alphabetically in a separate book \r\nfor each of the 137 towns, including records for Norwich and Woodstock \r\nsupplementing those published earlier. The State Library holds a copy of\r\n each book, and a copy was sent to each town clerk. The town books are \r\nlabeled &#8220;The Arnold Copy&#8221; and are known to many town clerks only by that\r\n name.</p>\r\n<p>The slip entries, covering the entire state alphabetically on \r\nseventy-nine reels, and the books for each town on seventeen reels are \r\navailable on microfilm through the Family History Library (<a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\">http://www.familysearch.org/</a>) \r\nand in many repositories. The <a href=\"http://www.genealogical.com/default.cfm?AFID=1132\">Genealogical \r\nPublishing Company</a> of Baltimore recently published the town books in\r\n paperback format. The complete fifty-three volume series is available \r\nin many libraries, and individual volumes may be ordered from the \r\npublisher.<br></p>\r\n<p><strong>Chronology of Vital Records Statutes in Connecticut</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>The records in the Barbour Collection reflect the extent to which \r\neach town clerk complied with these statutes. </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>1640</strong> &#8211; The first relevant statute: \"The Magestrate who \r\nsolemnizeth Mariedge betwixt any, shall cause a record to be entered in \r\nCourte of the day &amp; yere thereof.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>1644</strong> &#8211; Town clerks to record marriages and births with name of\r\n &#8220;the parent&#8221; (often just the father) for a fee of 4d. for each marriage\r\n and 2d. for each birth. The penalty for default was 5sh.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1650 </strong>&#8211; Town clerks to keep records of all births, deaths, and \r\nmarriages, receiving 3d. for births and deaths and 6d. for marriages. \r\nThe penalty for default was 5sh. Clerks to submit an annual transcript \r\nto the Secretary of the General Court. Only Windsor complies fully, and \r\nfor just a few years. Hartford and Fairfield kept only a few records. \r\nThese transcripts were included in Barbour for each of the three towns.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Ahnentafel\"><strong>1694</strong> &#8211;\"Ordayned ministers of the severall \r\nplantations\" granted liberty to \"joyne in mariage such persons as are \r\nqualifyed for the same.\" This was the first such permission granted for \r\nclergymen. Marriages earlier were considered a civil matter and were \r\nconducted only by magistrates.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1702</strong> &#8211; Requirement for submitting transcripts to the General \r\nCourt, long neglected, is formally dropped from the code of statutes.</p>\r\n<p><em>From the beginning, some clerks kept regular records of vital \r\nevents, roughly in chronological order. Many others complied only very \r\nloosely, recording marriages and births only in family groups. In this \r\nformat, few deaths are found except for minor children and for wives \r\npredeceasing their husbands. Then, beginning with the 1820 marriage \r\nstatute, virtually every town complied, though some failed to make \r\nentries in a new, separate book as mandated.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>1820</strong> &#8211;\"An Act for the Due and Orderly Celebrating of Marriage\"\r\n provides for publication of intentions, persons authorized to conduct \r\nmarriage, and consent of parents to underage marriage. Certificates were\r\n to be lodged with the town clerk who shall \"record said certificate at \r\nfull length in a book procured by him for this purpose,\" for which he is\r\n to receive 12 1/2 &#162; per record.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1848 </strong>&#8211; The registrar of each school district is to report each\r\n August all births, deaths, and marriages in the past year with names, \r\ncolor, occupations, place of birth, age, residence, cause of death, etc.\r\n Town clerk to enter the record in a book kept for that purpose. \r\nAbstract to be transmitted to the Secretary of the State. Entries begin \r\nAugust 1, 1847 for the year ended July 31, 1848.</p>\r\n<p><em>With its objective of compiling events to about 1850, the Barbour \r\nCollection includes these school district registers for some towns, but \r\nfor others it entirely omits records from this book. In a very few towns\r\n Barbour entries include some records beyond 1852.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>1852</strong> &#8211; Registration by school district discontinued. \r\nPhysicians and ministers were to submit certificates of births, deaths, \r\nand marriages. Town clerk or registrar to keep records of births, \r\ndeaths, and marriages, with specified details in ledger columns. Sextons\r\n were to submit monthly burial reports. Certificates required for \r\nremoval of bodies from towns.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1893</strong> &#8211; The registrars of the several towns \"shall complete the\r\n records of their respective towns by adding thereto a record of all the\r\n births, marriages, and deaths that have occurred in said towns since \r\nthe date of their incorporation, of which no certificate has been \r\nreturned to their office: provided, the facts &#8230; are obtained from the \r\nrecord of a public official, or of a church society &#8230;\" Compliance is \r\nspotty, but we can thank this statute for the inclusion in Barbour of \r\nchurch records for several early towns.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1897</strong> &#8211; First records at state level. Registrars to keep \r\nrecords in books furnished by the Bureau of Vital Statistics, to amend \r\nrecords when mistakes discovered, and to keep records in a fireproof \r\nsafe or in vaults. An attested copy was to be transmitted to the \r\nSuperintendent of Vital Statistics for all births, marriages, and deaths\r\n beginning July 1, 1897.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2001</strong> &#8211; First provision for electronic creation and \r\ntransmission of vital records certificates.

Not \r\nwanting to waste 130 good pages, the clerk used the old book to record \r\ntax liens. Kept among the tax records, this first volume of family \r\nrecords was not discovered by the compilers of the Barbour Collection.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Guilford</strong>: Jacobus, Donald Lines. &#8220;Guilford (Conn.) Vital \r\nRecords,&#8221; <em>The American Genealogist</em>, vol. 15 (1938) to vol. 19 \r\n(1942).</p>\r\n<p>These are from the first volume of town records. Apparently \r\noverlooked for Barbour because it was kept, not with deeds, but with \r\ntown meeting records. Jacobus does not comment on this omission.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newtown</strong>: Jessup, Harlan R. &#8220;Newtown, CT - Bills of Mortality, \r\n1797&#8211;1821: A Supplement to the Barbour Index,&#8221; <em>The Connecticut \r\nNutmegger</em> 29 (December 1996): 395-407.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Ahnentafel\">Separate death records or &#8220;Bills of Mortality&#8221; \r\nwere recorded in Newtown from 1797 to 1821 in three volumes of land \r\nrecords. Beginning in 1844, new clerk Isaac Beers transcribed these \r\n(with a number of errors) into a new book. Barbour includes this \r\ntranscription plus the originals from just two of the three deed books. \r\nThis article corrects transcription errors by both Isaac Beers and James\r\n Arnold and adds supplementary information from a private mortality \r\nrecord by Henry Beers, a cousin of the town clerk.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newtown</strong>: Jessup, Harlan R. &#8220;Newtown Marriages, 1794&#8211;1810, a \r\nRecent Discovery,&#8221; <em>Connecticut Ancestry</em> 40 (May 1998): 172-173.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Ahnentafel\">Strictly speaking, these thirty-six marriages are \r\nnot omissions from Barbour at all, since they never were recorded in the\r\n town books. Rather, they are original marriage records by Justice of \r\nthe Peace David Baldwin, pasted into a nineteenth-century scrapbook, and\r\n discovered in the collection of the local library.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pomfret</strong>:&#160; Labbe, Marilyn. &#8220;Six Marriages Performed by Lemuel \r\nIngalls, Justice of the Peace, Pomfret,&#8221; <em>The Connecticut Nutmegger</em>,\r\n 32 (June 1999): 8.</p>\r\n<p>Like the records of David Baldwin of Newtown, these were never \r\nentered in the town books.

Only marriages \r\nbeginning in 1820 were included in the town records and in the Barbour \r\nCollection.

Van Dusen, former \r\nConnecticut State Historian and professor of history at the University \r\nof Connecticut, wrote my favorite state history: <em>Connecticut</em>. \r\nComprehensive and beautifully illustrated, <em>Connecticut</em> will \r\nprovide answers to most of your questions within its carefully crafted \r\noverview of important events in Connecticut&#8217;s history. The chapter \r\n&#8220;Migrating Yankees,&#8221; for example, explains why, beginning in the 1750s \r\nand continuing for more than 100 years, Nutmeggers left Connecticut for \r\ndestinations north, south, and west. Among the reasons Van Dusen cites \r\nwere a rapidly growing population, poor land, inadequate transportation,\r\n the end of the French and Indian Wars, and the lure of speculation in \r\ncheap land available elsewhere. On the other hand, if your ancestor \r\nmigrated into Connecticut to work in a munitions factory during World \r\nWar I or II, you can learn about the importance of that industry to the \r\nstate&#8217;s economy &#8211; and to the nation. </p>\r\n<p>A more \r\nscholarly study of Connecticut history can be found in Harold J. \r\nBingham&#8217;s four-volume <em>History of Connecticut</em>. The first two \r\nvolumes deal with state history; the third covers histories of \r\nConnecticut business and industrial firms up to 1950; and the fourth \r\nfocuses on family and personal records of several hundred prominent \r\nNutmeggers who were alive in 1962. Although I would choose Van Dusen&#8217;s \r\nvolume to provide background information about specific historical \r\ntopics, Bingham&#8217;s volume could be very helpful if your Connecticut \r\nancestor was in business or industry or was a leading light. </p>\r\n<p>David Morris Roth, former professor of history at \r\nEastern Connecticut University and director of The Institute for \r\nConnecticut Studies there, wrote <em>Connecticut: A Bicentennial History</em>\r\n as part of The State and Nation series. Easy to read and shorter than \r\nthe other histories (and therefore lacking in detail), Roth&#8217;s volume \r\nprovides an accurate overview of Connecticut history. Possibly easier to\r\n locate than the previous publications, this volume might answer your \r\nquestions. </p>\r\n<p>Bruce Fraser, longtime director of \r\nthe Connecticut Humanities Council, wrote <em>The Land of Steady Habits: A\r\n Brief History of Connecticut</em> as a contribution to the 200<sup>th</sup>\r\n anniversary of Connecticut&#8217;s statehood. His goal was to provide the \r\ngeneral reader with a brief, analytical overview of the state&#8217;s diverse \r\nhistory.&#160; Emphasis is on such characteristics of the state as \r\nconservatism, local control, and ethnic and social diversity. Fraser \r\nalso brings up contrasts in Connecticut. One of the wealthiest states in\r\n the nation, Connecticut has three of the nation&#8217;s poorest cities, its \r\npolitical influence has always far exceeded it small geographic size, \r\nand Connecticut&#8217;s diverse ethnic and social mix contrasts with its \r\nYankee reputation. </p>\r\n<p><em>The Miracle of \r\nConnecticut</em> by Ellsworth S. Grant, Hartford businessman, historian, \r\nand descendant of an old Connecticut family, is a study of important \r\nachievements in Connecticut history as seen through the eyes of those \r\nwho made that history happen &#8211; the state&#8217;s movers and shakers. Chapter \r\nheadings include Connecticut Yankees, Government, Enterprises, Preachers\r\n and Teachers, Manufacturing and Invention, and Arts and Culture. A list\r\n of 100 representative Connecticut personalities begins with early- to \r\nmid-1600s Reverends Thomas Hooker and John Davenport and ends with \r\nmid-twentieth-century inventors Edwin Land and Igor Sikorsky. While \r\nGrant&#8217;s study is definitely not a social history that focuses on the \r\nlives of ordinary people, it provides insights into the diverse \r\ncontributions of the state&#8217;s prominent residents. </p>\r\n<p>David Roth edited the five-volume Series in \r\nConnecticut History, which, while written for high school history \r\nstudents, covers Connecticut&#8217;s history in considerable detail with the \r\nuse of specific examples and case studies. Each of the professional \r\nhistorians who contributed to the series wrote about the period in \r\nConnecticut history that he or she knew best. The five volumes are <em>Puritans\r\n against the Wilderness, Connecticut History to 1763; From Revolution to\r\n Constitution, 1763-1818; Preachers, Rebels, and Traders, 1818 to 1865; \r\nFrom Yankee to American, 1865-1914; </em>and <em>A Diverse People, 1914 to\r\n Present.</em></p>\r\n<p>Each volume begins with a list of\r\n dates important in one period of Connecticut history. Within these \r\nwell-indexed books, researchers will find information on most important \r\ntopics in Connecticut history. Extensive information on Connecticut&#8217;s \r\nborder disputes with Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New York is \r\nincluded. Or if you seek information on the immigration of Irish into \r\nConnecticut during the potato famine, you will not be disappointed. A \r\nchapter on the Civil War features descriptions of life on both the \r\nhomefront and battlefront. </p>\r\n<p>Between 1973 and \r\n1979 the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission of Connecticut \r\npublished thirty-five monographs in its Connecticut Bicentennial Series.\r\n Edited by former&#160;Trinity College Professor of History Glenn Weaver and \r\nwritten by scholars and historians, each booklet deals with one aspect \r\nor person of importance during the Revolutionary era (1763-1787). \r\nSeveral volumes contain biographies of Revolutionary leaders. Others \r\nconsider such topics as Connecticut Loyalists, black soldiers in the \r\nRevolution, and the role of Connecticut women during the Revolution. \r\nAnyone with ancestors in Connecticut during the eighteenth century, and \r\nparticularly during the Revolutionary years, will find these volumes of \r\ninterest. Possibly difficult to locate elsewhere, these slim volumes can\r\n be purchased from the Institute for Connecticut Studies, Eastern \r\nConnecticut State University, Willimantic, CT 06226, telephone \r\n877-587-8693. </p>\r\n<p><em>The Literature of Connecticut\r\n History</em>, compiled by Connecticut State Historian and professor of \r\nhistory at the University of Bridgeport, Christopher Collier and Bonnie \r\nB. Collier, is not a comprehensive history but rather an extensively \r\nannotated bibliography that covers published scholarship in the field of\r\n Connecticut history through 1981. Brief, informative historical essays \r\nintroduce most sections. </p>\r\n<p>Omitted from the \r\nbibliography are town histories, histories of churches and graveyards, \r\ngenealogies, city directories, and historic house surveys. </p>\r\n<p>Following a short introduction, the section on \r\n&#8220;Witchcraft in Connecticut,&#8221; for example, contains a list of eleven \r\nbooks or articles on that subject. If Connecticut&#8217;s Loyalists are of \r\ninterest, you will find three pages of references to that subject. Or if\r\n you wonder how your ancestors got around, every mode of transportation \r\nis covered in a separate chapter.&#160; Do you need information on \r\nConnecticut occupations such as raising tobacco, oystering, or clock \r\nmaking? You will find references to these jobs and many more. And if, \r\nheaven forbid, an ancestor served time in a Connecticut prison, \r\nreferences to that subject are also included. </p>\r\n<p>Within\r\n one of these very readable, yet scholarly volumes you should be able to\r\n find information about important events in Connecticut history that \r\naffected the lives of your Connecticut ancestors. You will learn what \r\nlife was like in the past, the factors that may have led ancestors to \r\nmigrate or remain, and the challenges and opportunities Nutmeggers faced\r\n in their daily lives during nearly four centuries. </p>\r\n<p>Books discussed in this article: </p>\r\n<p>Bingham, Harold J. <em>History of Connecticut</em>.

Hodge genealogy of the family \r\n(one sent by me and approved by the librarian before insertion into the \r\nfolder), and a transcription of Thomas Hodge's Bible. </p>\r\n<p>The Warner\r\n family file was rich with Bible and family record transcriptions. \r\nMembers of the Warner family that are referenced in the file include \r\nDavid H., Capt. Eleazer, Joseph, Chauncey, Francis, Benjamin, William, \r\nGilbert, Seth, and Ichabod. Also included is a transcript of the \r\nobituary of Charles S. Warner. </p>\r\n<p>The Connecticut State Library is \r\nopen, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.;\r\n Wednesday until 7:00 p.m.; and Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. It \r\nis located on Capitol Avenue in Hartford, right across the street from \r\nthe state capitol building. The History and Genealogy Reading Room is \r\nlocated in the basement. </p>\r\n<p>The Connecticut State Library also \r\nmaintains an <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.cslib.org/index.htm\">award-winning\r\n web site </a>with ample descriptions of all elements of their \r\ncollections. The website includes a page devoted to the <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.cslib.org/handg.htm\">History and \r\nGenealogy Reading Room </a>, that contains much valuable information \r\nabout their collections </p>\r\n<p><strong>Family Files at the Connecticut \r\nHistorical Society</strong></p>\r\n<p>Surely the most extensive collection of \r\nunpublished Connecticut family manuscripts is to be found at the \r\nConnecticut Historical Society. Well-respected genealogists living in \r\nConnecticut and working on local families have been donating their \r\nresearch materials, correspondence, and written treatments of families \r\nto the Society's manuscript collection for more than half a century. </p>\r\n<p>In most cases, the submitted materials are divided by family name \r\nbefore being placed in the manuscript collection. Research reports for \r\neach surname in the collection are likely to come from many sources. \r\nAuthors represented in the genealogical manuscript collection are as \r\ndiverse as Donald Lines Jacobus on Fairfield and New Haven Colony \r\nfamilies; Henry A. Stiles on Windsor and Wethersfield families; Lucius \r\nBarnes Barbour on Hartford families; and genealogists Julius Gay, Homer \r\nBrainard, D.W. Patterson, and Edna Miner Rogers, to touch just the tip \r\nof the iceberg. The library has an excellent card catalog for their \r\nmanuscript collection. </p>\r\n<p>Besides the genealogical reports and \r\nfamily treatments, the Society houses additional source materials that \r\ncan be a boon to genealogists. These include account books, periodicals,\r\n maps, and the Colonial Dames transcriptions of church records. </p>\r\n<p>The\r\n research library at the Connecticut Historical Society is open Tuesday \r\nto Saturday 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Use of the library is free to \r\nmembers. Non-members must pay six dollars for a one-day library pass \r\n(three dollars for children and seniors). The manuscript collection is \r\navailable to both non-members and members. Visit the CHS <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.chs.org/\">website</a>for more \r\ninformation. </p>\r\n<p>In a new twist of high-tech expertise, the \r\nConnecticut Historical Society is also collecting material for use by \r\nfamily historians a century down the line. Called the Connecticut \r\nVisions Family Photo Project, this digitized database of family photos \r\ncontains snapshots of Connecticut families that have been submitted to \r\nthe historical society. There is Mary Louise Soper as a child in 1913, \r\nfour generations of women from the Donahoe family, Amanda Lopez with her\r\n grandfather and grandmother, and many other treats. You can still \r\nsubmit your family photo to the historical society together with text \r\ndescribing the people and what they mean to you.

In Rhode \r\nIsland, they are kept by town and city government. In Connecticut, probate \r\nrecords are not kept by state, county, or local government. What, then, could \r\npossibly be left? It's the \"probate district\"--a concept unique to Connecticut. \r\nThis column will discuss the history of probate record keeping as it pertains to \r\nwills, estates, and guardianships. Today probate courts cover many aspects of \r\nfamily law, but the column will only deal with those related to the processing \r\nof estates. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>At different times during the colonial period, records were kept by different \r\nagencies. This early period can be confusing for a genealogist. After all, why \r\nwould you expect the estate of a man dying in Connecticut in 1688 to be \r\nprocessed in Boston? It doesn't make much sense on the surface. Luckily, there \r\nare ways to find the more obscure items. The good news is that the system \r\nsettled down by 1698. With the establishment of probate districts that year, we \r\nenter an era of predictability in record storage, always a plus for a \r\ngenealogist.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Three Separate Colonies (1635-1662)</strong><br>Connecticut began in the 1630s \r\nas three different colonies called Connecticut, New Haven, and Saybrook. \r\nSaybrook joined Connecticut Colony in the 1640s. King Charles II mandated union \r\nwith New Haven in 1662. It took a few years, however, for New Haven to comply \r\nwith this mandate. During this early period in Connecticut history, each colony \r\nhad its own legislature, called the General Court. The upper house of this \r\nlegislature would sit as a court, called the Particular Court, for criminal and \r\ncivil proceedings. Probate records in the small colonies were processed in these \r\ncourts.</p>\r\n<p>New Haven Colony probates were filed with the colony's secretary and can be \r\nfound in the colony records:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>C. J. Hoadley, <em>Records of the Colony and Plantation of New Haven</em> \r\n(Hartford, 1857-1858). </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Connecticut Colony probates were filed with the General Court records until \r\n1649, and afterwards with the Particular Court. </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Charles William Manwaring, <em>A Digest of Early Connecticut Probate \r\nRecords</em>, 3 vols. (1904-1906; reprint, Genealogical Publishing Company), \r\nwhich includes probate records from the General Court, 1639-1649, the Particular \r\nCourt, 1649-1677, as well as the first twelve volumes, 1635-1750, of Hartford \r\nProbate Court. </li>\r\n<li>J.

In what are today Fairfield and New London \r\nCounties, from 1649 to 1666, there were Special Particular Courts in addition to \r\nthe Particular Court sitting in Hartford. Estates filed in the special courts \r\nare available today only in the originals and microfilm copies of the Fairfield \r\nand New London Probate Districts. A few probate records from 1639-1649 are \r\nscattered in town records, such as those of Guilford and Stamford.</p>\r\n<p><strong>County-Level Probate Courts (1662-1698)</strong><br>After a few years of \r\nfoot-dragging, New Haven Colony joined Connecticut Colony as required under the \r\ncharter of 1662. It was also at this time that the first four original counties \r\nwere established in Connecticut; they were Fairfield, New Haven, New London, and \r\nHartford. In May 1666, probate courts were established in those counties. \r\nAlthough these county-level probate courts predate the probate district system, \r\ntheir records can now be found as the earliest records of the first four probate \r\ndistricts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Administration of Gov. Edmond Andros (1687-1688)</strong><br>From 1687 to 1688, \r\nduring the reign of Gov. Edmond Andros over New England, probate records were \r\nagain filed with the Particular Court, but for the period from 1686 to 1689, \r\nestates valued at more than &#163;50 were filed in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. \r\n</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>E. Trumbull, <em>Records of the Particular Court of the Colony of \r\nConnecticut, Administration of Sir Edmund Andros, Royal Governor, 1687-1688</em> \r\n(Hartford: Case, Lockwood, and Brainard, 1936). </li>\r\n<li><em>The American Genealogist</em>, vols. 12-14, contains a list of the estates \r\nhandled in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, from 1686 to 1689. Note that these old \r\nSuffolk County estates are now at the Massachusetts State Archives and available \r\non microfilm.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Probate District Courts (After 1698)</strong><br>In 1698 probate districts were \r\nestablished. The first four were the original four county probate courts. In \r\n1719 the process of splitting districts began. By 1900 there were over 100 \r\nprobate districts, and today the number approaches 140. This continuous process \r\nof subdividing probate districts has a very real impact on your ability to find \r\nrecords. You need a crib sheet that tells you when each district was \r\ndaughtered-off its parent district. Then you need to sit down and determine in \r\nwhich district or parent district the records for a person dying in a particular \r\nyear would be located. Fortunately, there are two widely available such crib \r\nsheets. </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Marcia Melnyk, <em>Genealogist's Handbook for New England Research</em> \r\n(Boston: New England Historic Genealogical Society, 1999) contains a list of \r\nConnecticut towns, their parent towns, and their probate districts. </li>\r\n<li>Charles William Manwaring, comp., <em>A Digest of Early Connecticut Probate \r\nRecords</em>, 3 vols. (1904-1906; reprint, Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing \r\nCompany, 1995) contains two \"appendices\" located at the front of the first \r\nvolume. One concerns the daughtering-off of towns, the other the daughtering-off \r\nof probate districts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Connecticut probate records from the probate district system are widely \r\navailable in microfilm format. There are three resources to consult when doing a \r\nthorough probate record search: </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>The statewide index to probate packages -- not to probate record books -- \r\nsubmitted by local probate courts to the state library for archival purposes, \r\nfrom the earliest records to 1880. This one massive index is arranged by name of \r\nthe deceased as well as by name of the child for whom guardianship papers were \r\nfiled. Each card shows the name of the deceased, the town of residence, the year \r\nthe estate was filed, plus two important facts: the name of the probate district \r\nand the docket number. Each index card contains the quantity of each type of \r\ndocument filed in the probate package for that estate. </li>\r\n<li>Probate packages for each probate district. These were filmed in order by \r\ndocket number. They could include all the paperwork submitted to the court for \r\neach estate, such as wills, distributions, administrator's bonds, accounts, \r\nreceipts, and selections of guardians, as well as all other document types. \r\nNearly all probate district packages have been filmed up to 1880 and many have \r\nbeen filmed up to estates filed in 1915. </li>\r\n<li>Probate court record books. These are arranged chronologically by session. \r\nEach book includes records of all business conducted in each session, such as \r\nadministrative or guardianship bonds, will transcripts, inventory transcripts, \r\nand other business. Most probate record books have been filmed to \r\n1915.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It is important to look in both probate packages and in probate record books \r\nfor each and every probate you research. In fact, I have an example from \r\nRoxbury, Connecticut. My four greats grandfather, Philo Hodge, appears in the \r\nprobate package card index. He died in 1842, when Roxbury came under the \r\njurisdiction of the Woodbury Probate District. I was able to find Philo's will \r\nin his estate probate package, but not in the probate record book. He left his \r\nmeager belongings to his wife Lucy. Lucy Hodge died in 1853, and her name does \r\nnot appear in the probate package card index. At the time of her death, Roxbury \r\nwas in the jurisdiction of the newly formed Roxbury Probate District. There, in \r\nthe probate record book, I found transcriptions of receipts for $25 from her \r\nestate from each of her surviving nine children. They had fanned out across the \r\nU.S., from Connecticut to New York, Ohio, and Indiana. I would have missed some \r\nof them without the probate record books to point the way. None of these \r\nreceipts evidently survived to be placed in a probate package, so Lucy's name \r\ndid not appear in the index.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Further Finding Aids</strong><br>I have a personal favorite for my own pedigree \r\nproblems in Fairfield County. Spencer Mead created his own set of abstracts to \r\nrecords for a few towns there in a county notoriously difficult for research. \r\nLeave it to my ancestors to live in a place where town, church, and vital \r\nrecords are all too frequently missing. These abstracts have been microfilmed \r\nand are available through Family History Centers. For probate records, Mead's \r\nabstracts can be used as an every-name index to probate record books. His three \r\nabstracts are: </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Abstracts of Probate Records for the District of Fairfield, County of \r\nFairfield and State of Connecticut </li>\r\n<li>Abstracts of Probate Records for the District of Stamford, County of \r\nFairfield and State of Connecticut, 1729-1802, also available at NEHGS </li>\r\n<li>Abstracts of Probate Records for the District of Stamford, County of \r\nFairfield and State of Connecticut, 1803-1848, also available at NEHGS</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The History and Genealogy Unit of the Connecticut State Library has prepared \r\nan excellent introduction to probate records, which is available on their <a href=\"http://www.cslib.org/probintr.htm\" target=\"_new\">website</a>.</p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/probate-records-in-connecticut/", "published": "April 17, 2000", "id": 43}, {"author": "Joyce S.

Hartford might be described as a &#8220;one-stop \r\ngenealogical research destination,&#8221; especially for anyone with limited time or \r\nancestors from several Connecticut localities. This article will concentrate on \r\nrecords available at the Connecticut Historical Society (CHS). </p>\r\n<p>The Connecticut Historical Society, created in 1825 by a \r\nresolution of the Connecticut General Assembly, originally had as its mission to \r\ncollect civil, ecclesiastical, and natural history materials relating to the \r\nUnited States and especially to the state of Connecticut. No mention was made of \r\ncollecting family history materials. Fortunately, in the late nineteenth \r\ncentury, CHS librarian Albert Carlos Bates recognized the importance of such \r\nacquisitions and initiated their family history collection. </p>\r\n<strong>Visiting the \r\nConnecticut Historical Society</strong><p>Early one Tuesday in May, I set out to revisit CHS. Staff \r\nGenealogist Judith Ellen Johnson gave me a grand tour of the library during the \r\nmorning, and in the afternoon I used the library to work on research projects \r\nand to collect information for future articles in this series. </p>\r\n<p>The CHS library, located at One Elizabeth Street, Hartford, \r\nCT 06105-2292, on the Hartford-West Hartford town line, is open from 10 a.m. to \r\n5 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays and is closed Sundays, Mondays, and major \r\nholidays. The non-member daily admission fee is $6.00 ($3.00 for seniors age 60 \r\nand over). Ample on-site parking is available. The reading room is set up for \r\nthe convenience of genealogists and historians. From previous visits, I knew I \r\nwould find a knowledgeable and helpful library staff. For details and directions \r\nconsult the CHS <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.chs.org/\">website</a> or \r\ntelephone the library at (860) 236-5621.</p>\r\n<p>Many of the library&#8217;s 100,000 books and 3 million manuscripts \r\nwould be of interest to genealogists. In addition to family histories and \r\ncompilations of vital and other records, researchers will find local, county, \r\nand state histories. Social histories are also available to provide background \r\ninformation about the places where ancestors lived. The majority of books and \r\nmanuscripts are housed in closed stacks. They can be located in card catalogs \r\nand called for use in the reading room. Waiting time for materials called from \r\nthe stacks is minimal. CHS also houses collections of microfilm and microfiche, \r\nas well as CD -ROMs. </p>\r\n<p>While you are at the library, allow time to visit the CHS \r\nmuseum, which has special and permanent exhibits featuring outstanding examples \r\nof furniture, costumes, textiles, paintings, decorative arts, toys, and tools \r\nfrom many eras, as well as exhibits about life in<sup> </sup>twentieth-century \r\nConnecticut.</p>\r\n<p>You can also visit CHS online. CHS has recently developed a \r\nnew, easy-to-use <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.chs.org/\">website</a> that \r\nprovides extensive information about the library and museum. The <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.chs.org/exhib/digexhib.htm\">Online Exhibits</a> page \r\nmay be of interest to genealogists. Exhibits include &#8220;Connecticut in 1836,&#8221; \r\nfeaturing sketches of local buildings and views by John Warner Barber; &#8220;Hartford \r\nin the 1850s,&#8221; featuring drawings, prints, and paintings by Joseph Ropes; and \r\n&#8220;Civil War Treasures.&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.cthistoryonline.org/\">Connecticut \r\nHistory Online</a>, a collaborative website, provides online access to nearly \r\n15,000 historic images from the archives of CHS, Mystic Seaport, and the Thomas \r\nJ. Dodd Research Center at the University of Connecticut. Images are enhanced by \r\nbrief historical commentaries. You might find historic drawings, prints, or \r\nphotographs of places your ancestors frequented. Examples include town greens, \r\nfactories, churches, and bird&#8217;s-eye views of towns. Additional images will be \r\nadded in the future.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can&#8217;t Travel to Hartford?</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you are unable to visit the library and you do not use the \r\nInternet, consider becoming a member of CHS. (Consider becoming a member even if \r\nyou can!) The annual membership fee is $25.00 for students, individuals living \r\noutside Connecticut, and anyone age 65 or over. In-state individual memberships \r\nare $30.00. </p>\r\n<p>CHS members may borrow for one month up to three volumes from \r\nthe Society&#8217;s Loan Collection of 1,000 genealogies and town histories (this \r\nprivilege also applies to members of the Society of Mayflower Descendants in \r\nConnecticut). The fee is $5 per volume plus return postage. A <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.chs.org/loancoll/default.htm\">catalog of the \r\ncollection</a> and information about borrowing books is available on the CHS \r\nwebsite or you can contact the <a href=\"mailto:judith_e_johnson@chs.org\">CHS \r\nLoan Coordinator</a>. </p>\r\n<p>CHS volunteers provide a research service for genealogists \r\nwith Connecticut ancestors. They will search CHS library sources for information \r\nabout specific individuals. The fee per inquiry is $15 for members and $25 for \r\nnon-members, plus photocopy and service charges. To obtain details and forms \r\ncontact Judith Ellen Johnson by regular mail at the library address listed above \r\nor by <a href=\"mailto:judith_e_johnson@chs.org\">email</a>. </p>\r\n<p>The large CHS <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.chs.org/graphcoll/graphphot.htm\">photographic \r\ncollection</a> might include a photo of one of your ancestors. Nancy Finlay, \r\nCurator of Graphics, will search the collections for images of specific \r\nindividuals. She will respond to telephone calls directed to (860) 236-5621, \r\next. 236 or to inquiries via <a href=\"mailto:nancy_finlay@chs.org\">email</a> or \r\nregular mail. You may also contact her to schedule an appointment between \r\n1:00-5:00 p.m., Mondays through Fridays. </p>\r\n<strong>Genealogy Collections for New \r\nEngland</strong><p>Although Connecticut is the principal focus for CHS \r\ncollections, other New England states as well as New York, Pennsylvania, and \r\nOhio are included.

While the quality varies, the collection includes some \r\nexcellent, fully documented genealogies, filed by family surname or town. In \r\naddition to family histories, there are data sheets and copies or abstracts of \r\nbible, vital, church, land, and probate records. In some cases the sources of \r\nthe information may be difficult to determine. In all cases, information should \r\nbe verified in other sources. Surnames with sizeable collections include Barnes, \r\nBrown, Durant, Gillette, Higgins, Kibbe, Kinney, Meacham, Ogden, Parmelee, \r\nRoyce, Smith, Sykes, Tillinghast, Tinker, Tuller, Waterman, and Whitelesey. </p>\r\n<p>Several genealogical manuscript collections merit \r\ndescription:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The D.W. Patterson Collection includes 2,200 books and pamphlets; \r\ntranscriptions of church, cemetery, and vital records; and notes on specific \r\nfamilies. Compilations for specific areas include Tioga County, New York, \r\nfamilies; Ridgefield, Connecticut area families; and East Haddam, Connecticut \r\nfamilies. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>The William L. Weaver Collection includes manuscript genealogies of 144 \r\nfamilies of ancient Windham, Connecticut. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>The Julius Gay Collection includes abstracts of vital records, cemetery \r\ninscriptions, and church, bible, and probate records pertaining primarily to \r\nFarmington families. The collection also contains well-documented histories of \r\narea families. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>The Erastus Ely Case Collection includes family sheets tracing the \r\ndescendants of John Case of Simsbury. Sources are indicated on most sheets. \r\n<br><br></li>\r\n<li>The Charles L.N. Camp Collection includes genealogical notes on \r\napproximately 1,500 families with documentation for many families, primarily \r\nfrom secondary sources. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>The Mrs. Edna Minor Rogers Collection includes carefully documented studies \r\nof the Edgerton, Rogers, Stevens, and Welch families, as well as research notes \r\non many New London County families. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>The Lucius Barnes Barbour Collections include abstracts of vital records, \r\ncemetery inscriptions, bible records, indexed Hartford probate abstracts from \r\n1750-1800, and group sheets of eastern Connecticut families. In addition, the \r\ncollection includes a lengthy study Barbour prepared on his own ancestry. \r\n<br><br></li>\r\n<li>The Donald Lines Jacobus Collection includes his pedigrees of New Haven \r\nfamilies; his research notes, client files, and family manuscripts; and his \r\nsix-volume study of the descendants of Ferdinand and Isabella of \r\nSpain.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The Connecticut Towns Collection contains documents \r\nfrom most Connecticut towns. While not complete, town records may include \r\nabstracts of cemetery inscriptions, probate records, vital records, church \r\nrecords, land records, town meeting minutes, and abstracts of newspaper marriage \r\nand death notices.</p>\r\n<strong>Maps and Atlases</strong><p>Maps and atlases are useful resources for genealogists. \r\nExactly where is that town located? Did its name change? Did its borders change \r\nor did state boundaries change? (Connecticut borders with adjoining states \r\nchanged several times.)</p>\r\n<p>Regional maps showing topographical features can help explain \r\nmigration patterns while local and state maps from different time periods can \r\nshow shifting borders. Local maps and atlases can pinpoint exactly where \r\nancestors lived. The names of residents are often noted on manuscript maps, as \r\nwell as on some old atlases. There&#8217;s a good chance that CHS has a map or atlas \r\nof interest in its extensive collection. </p>\r\n<p>Maps and atlases at CHS include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>New England, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio (good for showing migration \r\npatterns) <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Maps published before 1850 <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Government topographical maps <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Manuscript maps of towns (historical manuscripts) <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Beers Atlases for most Connecticut towns, 1860s-1880s <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps of larger Connecticut town and cities from \r\n1880-twentieth century (limited in number) <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Aerial views from 1934, 1951, 1965, and 1970 </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Newspapers </strong><p>The <em>Hartford Courant</em> and <em>Hartford Times</em> from \r\n1949 to 1976 are available on microfilm. (Earlier issues of the <em>Times</em> are \r\navailable in hard copy.) The library collection also includes issues of early \r\nnewspapers from other Connecticut towns. Some of these issues are unique and can \r\nbe found only at CHS. Anyone who has used old local newspapers for research \r\nknows they are often more personal than large city newspapers. Although \r\ninformation in birth, marriage, and death notices may be minimal, columns about \r\nneighborhoods provide interesting details about daily lives. Featured articles \r\noften describe in considerable detail such events as graduations, reunions, \r\naccidents, political rallies, meetings of local organizations, and other local \r\ngatherings.</p>\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other Collections of Interest to Genealogists</strong> </p>\r\n<p><strong>1930s WPA Historic House Survey</strong></p>\r\n<p>During the 1930s the Works Progress Administration (WPA) \r\nundertook a little-known statewide census of old and distinctive buildings in \r\nConnecticut, similar to the statewide survey of historic buildings sponsored by \r\nthe Connecticut Historical Commission during the late 1970s. The WPA survey \r\nfocused on structures built prior to about 1850. Arranged by town, the survey is \r\nreasonably complete. Each building is described in detail on one page, and the \r\ndescription is accompanied in most cases by a photograph.</p>\r\n<strong>Military \r\nRecords</strong><p>Military collections are available for the French and Indian \r\nWar, the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the Civil War. The most \r\nextensive of these is the Connecticut American Revolution Collection, which \r\nincludes journals, diaries, and letters of participants. The Civil War \r\nCollection includes broadsides, maps, letters, and photographs. Some finding \r\naids for the Civil War Collection are available at the CHS \r\nwebsite.</p>\r\n<strong>Special Connecticut Collections</strong><p>Depending on where your Connecticut ancestors lived and what \r\nthey did, you might find information of interest in one of the small, \r\nspecialized collections at CHS. For example, if you had a Connecticut minister \r\nin your family, one or more of his sermons might be in the extensive sermon \r\ncollection. If an ancestor went to Yale, consult the collection of Yale \r\nmaterials. Or if an ancestor attended a private school in Connecticut, you might \r\nfind a school history or catalog. Did you have a Connecticut author in your \r\nfamily? If so, consult the collection of works by and about Connecticut writers. \r\nIf your ancestor was a Connecticut printer, some of his work may be included in \r\nthe special collection of Connecticut imprints. Was your Connecticut ancestor a \r\nnoted person? Perhaps a biography is included in the extensive collection of \r\nbiographies of Connecticut people. You may find a late eighteenth or \r\nnineteenth-century trade catalog or the business records for the Connecticut \r\ncompany for which an ancestor once worked. </p>\r\n<p>Do you want to know what the weather was like way back then? \r\nAn old Connecticut almanac from the CHS almanac collection should answer your \r\nquestions. </p>\r\n<strong>CHS Museum Collections</strong><p>While at CHS, check to determine if their collections include \r\na portrait of your ancestor. Genealogical information about the subject and his \r\nor her family usually accompany portraits in the CHS collection. Similar \r\ngenealogical information is associated with museum collections of furniture, \r\nfurnishings, textiles, costumes, and samplers. </p>\r\n<strong>British Records</strong><p>CHS has a surprisingly large collection of British materials. \r\nWhile you are there you might want to look in their collection of bound English \r\nparish registers and probate records or their collection of Victorian histories. \r\n</p>\r\n<p><br>So much information and so little time!

Although I have yet to discover my first Connecticut ancestor, I \r\nwas involved in historical and genealogical research in Connecticut for fifteen \r\nof the twenty-one years I lived there before moving to Massachusetts in 1991. I \r\ncontinue my interest in Connecticut history and genealogy.</p>\r\n<p>Future topics will include records at the <a href=\"http://www.cslib.org/%20target=_new\">Connecticut State Library</a> and the \r\n<a href=\"http://www.chs.org/\" target=\"_new\">Connecticut Historical Society</a> in \r\nHartford, lesser-known Connecticut libraries with outstanding genealogical \r\ncollections, genealogical societies in Connecticut, several leading Connecticut \r\ngenealogists and their work, and special publications of interest to Connecticut \r\nresearchers. Your suggestions for future topics are welcome.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Visiting Town Halls</strong><br>Although many Connecticut records have been \r\nmicrofilmed and are widely available, many researchers like to visit town halls \r\nwhere they can do \"hands-on\" research from original records or first-generation \r\ncopies of those records. Researchers planning such a visit may wonder what they \r\nwill find and whether it will be worthwhile.</p>\r\n<p>Much ink has been spilled over how to get the most out of visiting a town \r\nhall. If you plan your research in advance, allow enough time for careful and \r\nthorough research, and use common sense, your visit can be rewarding. Offices of \r\ntown clerks and registrars of vital records, as well as probate offices, may be \r\nopen to the public during limited hours. In small towns, the town clerk may, in \r\nfact, hold more than one town position. <a href=\"http://www.vitalrec.com/ct.html\">Call</a> before visiting these offices \r\nfor more information. </p>\r\n<p>When planning your trip, determine when the town of interest was founded. \r\nRecords there will begin at that date, and earlier records will be found in the \r\nparent town. This information can be found in Betty Jean Morrison's \r\n<em>Connecting to Connecticut</em> (Glastonbury, 1995) and in Marcia D. Melnyk's \r\n<em>Genealogist's Handbook for New England Research</em> (Boston, NEHGS, 1999 and \r\n2001). For example, vital records for the town of Cromwell begin in 1851, but \r\nearlier Cromwell records are found in Middletown. Until the early 1800s New \r\nCanaan and Darien were part of Stamford, where their early records will be \r\nfound.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Town Clerks and Registrars of Vital Records</strong><br>Town clerks have always \r\nbeen responsible for recording information pertaining to Connecticut's 169 \r\ntowns, including birth, marriage, and death records. Vital records in \r\nConnecticut have never been kept on the county level. As towns grew, that work \r\nwas sometimes reassigned to registrars of vital statistics, whose offices may \r\nnot be in the town or city hall. Among the towns with separate registrars of \r\nvital statistics are Bridgeport, Greenwich, Hartford, Middletown, New Haven, and \r\nWaterbury. </p>\r\n<p>Town clerks, registrars, and other town officials fit requests of \r\ngenealogists into busy schedules, so be patient and courteous to personnel and \r\nother researchers in the offices. Present your driver's license or other \r\nidentification and explain the reason for your visit. Some town halls have open \r\nstacks, while in others clerks bring out requested volumes, perhaps one at a \r\ntime. If you follow all the procedures and ask if there are other records of \r\npossible interest, you may be rewarded with an opportunity to see special \r\nrecords that are not on the open shelves. One Connecticut town clerk, who used \r\nto have a \"goodie cabinet\" where she stored old records under lock and key, \r\ncould sometimes be persuaded to bring them out. Another clerk in a small \r\nConnecticut town who was helping me find information about a certain family \r\nbrought out an early nineteenth century handwritten compilation of information \r\nabout town residents of that era.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Vital Records</strong><br>Town halls or bureaus of vital statistics in \r\nConnecticut towns and cities are the only places where you will find all the \r\nvital records of a town, dating from its founding to the present.</p>\r\n<p>The majority of vital records up to about 1850 have been included in the \r\nBarbour Collection of vital records or in separate town volumes. Many have been \r\nmicrofilmed and are available at the <a href=\"http://www.newenglandancestors.org/\">NEHGS Research Library</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.chs.org/\" target=\"_new\">Connecticut Historical Society</a>, the \r\n<a href=\"http://www.cslib.org/\" target=\"_new\">Connecticut State Library</a>, or \r\nthrough the various <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\" target=\"_new\">Family \r\nHistory Centers</a>. While generally accurate and complete, these compilations \r\nare derivative sources, and genealogists often prefer to examine the original \r\nrecords kept by town clerks. Even then, some records may be missed or omitted. \r\nIn a recent article in <em>Connecticut Ancestry</em>, \"Darien Vital Records, Book \r\n1: Another Barbour Omission,\" Harlan R. Jessup discusses vital record keeping in \r\nDarien after its separation from Stamford in 1820. For some time, the new Darien \r\ntown clerk used the same volume for recording vital and tax records. Because \r\nthat volume was eventually filed with tax records, agents collecting vital \r\nrecords for the Barbour compilation failed to find the book and omitted early \r\nvital records for about sixteen Darien families. </p>\r\n<p>Connecticut vital records from about 1850 to 1897 are available from town \r\nclerks or registrars, on microfilm at the Connecticut State Library, or through \r\nthe FHL. Vital records from July 1897 to the present are kept by town clerks or \r\nregistrars, who send copies to the Department of Public Health in Hartford. The \r\nvital records office is currently closed for microfilming of its holdings. In \r\nConnecticut, access to birth records for the last 100 years is restricted to the \r\nactual person or a close family member, public officials, attorneys, persons \r\nauthorized by court order, or members of genealogical societies authorized to do \r\nbusiness in Connecticut. You will need to present identification and show your \r\ncredentials to see these records or obtain copies.</p>\r\n<p>For information on ordering vital records by mail, consult Barbara Mathews' \r\n<a href=\"http://www.newenglandancestors.org/education/articles/research/localities/connecticut/connecticut_vital_records_659_10104.asp\">earlier \r\ncolumn</a> on Connecticut vital records or read the <a href=\"http://www.vitalrec.com/guidelines.html\" target=\"_new\">general \r\nguidelines</a> online. You may also find information about obtaining vital \r\nrecords from specific towns at <a href=\"http://www.vitalrec.com/ct.html\" target=\"_new\">this site</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Earmarks</strong><br>Beginning in the 1640s and continuing through the \r\nmid-nineteenth century, residents of Connecticut towns were required to register \r\nthe earmark or brand they used to identify their cattle and swine. Town clerks \r\nrecorded descriptions and sometimes included drawings of these marks along with \r\nother town records. In early volumes, earmark registrations were often \r\ninterspersed with vital records and town meeting minutes. In later volumes they \r\nwere usually grouped on special pages in town record volumes. </p>\r\n<p>Earmarks are an overlooked and important source of genealogical information. \r\nThey indicate that the registrant was resident in a certain town at a certain \r\ndate. They may state family relationships, such as the following Stamford, \r\nConnecticut, earmark, entered into town records on September 4, 1790: \"Catherine \r\nBishop enteres for her Son Isaac Bishop's ear mark the same that was formerly \r\nentred to his Grand Father Isaac Bishop decd., viz. a crop on the end of the \r\nnear ear, and two slits in the end of the off ear.\" Some earmarks were \r\ntransferred during a registrant's lifetime, proving that both individuals were \r\nliving in the town at that date. Again from Stamford Town Records, February 1, \r\n1792: \"Joseph Stevens junr. enters for his ear mark the same that was formerly \r\nentred to Nathaniel Hoyt &amp; by his permission as he saith, viz., a crop on \r\nthe end of the near ear and a hole in the same.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>Town Meeting Minutes </strong><br>Town clerks sometimes recorded minutes of \r\ntown meetings in the same volumes as vital and land records. In some Connecticut \r\ntowns, these early volumes no longer exist; elsewhere you may find originals or \r\nearly copies. Microfilmed copies of original or transcribed town meeting minutes \r\nare available for some towns.</p>\r\n<p>Each town held an annual meeting of freemen or property owners and additional \r\nmeetings took place during the year, as needed to transact town business. \r\nElections of town officials were held at annual meetings. Reading town meeting \r\nminutes is a good way to learn about the history of your ancestor's town and to \r\nflesh out the skeletons of (male) ancestors who actively participated in town \r\ngovernment. One of your ancestors may have served as a selectman, grand juryman, \r\nsurveyor of highways, sealer of weights and measures, brander of horses, or \r\npound keeper. When someone fell upon hard times, they might be \"warned out\" of \r\ntown or assigned to a townsman as a boarder. In Cornwall in December 1774: \r\n\"Daniel Steward agreed to keep Abiel Dudley one year next ensuing for L6-15s-0 \r\nlawful money and keep his clothes in good repair&#8230;\" For several years, \r\nresponsibility for the care of Abiel Dudley was passed around to the lowest \r\nbidder. Town meeting minutes also include discussions on schools, taxes, \r\nsmallpox inoculations, bounties for killing rattlesnakes, foxes, and wildcats, \r\nannexations, Sabbath Day houses and meeting house pews, construction of highways \r\nand bridges, liquor licensing, and other topics of local concern.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Land Records and Town Maps</strong><br>While some Connecticut deeds have been \r\nmicrofilmed, visiting a town hall enables the researcher to see every deed of \r\ninterest. Since the founding of their towns, Connecticut town clerks have been \r\nresponsible for keeping land records that include deeds, mortgages, attachments, \r\nliens, tax liens, judgments, releases, conveyances, and grantor-grantee indexes \r\nto those records. Maps of towns and subdivisions, surveys, and planning and \r\nzoning records may also be found in town clerk offices.</p>\r\n<p>Deeds are a source of information that no family historian should overlook. \r\nInformation about family relationships included in deeds has solved many \r\ngenealogical problems. Other important genealogical information found in deeds \r\nmay include places of residence of both grantor and grantee and occupations or \r\ntitles. Relationships may be stated as well as the names of earlier owners of \r\nthe same parcel of land, often family members. Since indexes to land records \r\ninclude only the names of grantors and grantees, studying deeds is essential for \r\nferreting out important information. For more about land records, consult \r\nPatricia Hatcher's article <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/research/services/articles_land_records_newenglands.asp\">Land Records: An \r\nUnder-Appreciated Genealogical Resource</a>.</p>\r\n<p>One of my favorite projects that used information from land records is \r\n<em>Genealogical References in Stamford, Connecticut. Land Records, Volumes A-S, \r\n1666-1800+</em> (Stamford, Connecticut Ancestry Society, 1999), available as both \r\na book and CD-ROM. While abstracting early Stamford deeds, Edith Wicks noted and \r\nlater prepared a separate index of all genealogical references in those deeds. \r\nUnder entries for the surname \"Allen,\" for example, one finds the names of \r\nEunice Allen and her deceased husband John, originally of Stamford and later of \r\nMamaketing, Ulster Co., New York. Also listed are the names of their children, \r\nLydia, Reuben, and Seymour of Ulster Co., and Trowbridge, who had moved to Irish \r\nSettlement, Northampton Co., Penn.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other Records Kept by Town Clerks</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Voter registration records: Town clerks keep current voter registration \r\nlists, and some town clerks save old voter registration books. They might be in \r\nthe town hall basement or attic or in out-of-the way storage rooms. In Stamford, \r\nfor example, the town clerk still has the separate registration books for men \r\nand women used after 1893 when, in Connecticut, women were granted the right to \r\nvote in local school elections. </li>\r\n<li>Election and absentee ballot information </li>\r\n<li>Veterans' Records: Town clerks keep on file limited military records of \r\nveterans who apply for tax exemptions or for patients in veterans' hospitals who \r\nrequire assistance. </li>\r\n<li>Trade name registrations </li>\r\n<li>Notary Public applications, filings, and certifications </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Probate District Court Offices</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Probate Records</strong><br>For an historic overview of probate record keeping \r\nin Connecticut, consult Barbara Jean Mathews' <a href=\"http://www.newenglandancestors.org/education/articles/research/localities/connecticut/probate_records_in_connecticut_659_10105.asp\">column</a> \r\non probate records previously published in this series.</p>\r\n<p>Connecticut's probate records are kept in 131 probate district court offices, \r\nnot quite one district office for each of Connecticut's 169 towns. Over the \r\nyears there have been many changes in district boundaries, so consult \r\n<em>Connecting to Connecticut</em> or <em>Genealogist's Handbook for New England \r\nResearch</em> to determine where you should look for probate records that include \r\nthe years of interest to you.</p>\r\n<p>Probate district courts handle estate settlements of deceased town residents, \r\nguardianships for minors and jurisdiction over their trusts, legal matters \r\npertaining to adoptions, and powers of attorney for adults judged incompetent. \r\nProbate offices in town halls maintain indexes to probate records of their \r\ndistrict. Most Connecticut towns sent their probate packets of original \r\ndocuments through about 1880 to Hartford, so most original probate records for \r\nthe early years are available only at the Connecticut State Library or on \r\nmicrofilm. Towns maintain an index of records sent to Hartford. However, most \r\ntown probate district offices have probate court record books containing \r\nhandwritten copies of the original records, and these volumes are available for \r\nresearch. As Barbara Mathews points out, information in original probate packets \r\nand in probate court record books may vary, so both should be consulted.</p>\r\n<p>Most twentieth century probate packets of original documents as well as \r\nrecord books with copies of those documents will be found in probate district \r\noffices. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Assessor's Records</strong><br>Grant lists or property valuations for tax \r\npurposes are kept in assessor's offices in town halls. Although information for \r\nseveral recent years may be found there, historic tax lists may be in town \r\narchives, historical societies, or at the Connecticut State Library.</p>\r\n<p>Happy hunting in town halls.

Have you found that census frustrating to use? If so, chances \r\nare you were looking for an ancestor who lived in one of the Connecticut towns \r\nwith heads of households listed alphabetically. Or perhaps your ancestor lived \r\nin a town enumerated together with other towns in the same county. Genealogists \r\nare encouraged to study the neighbors of their ancestors on the theory that \r\nfamily members often lived near one another. When names are listed \r\nalphabetically, determining who neighbors were is impossible. When several towns \r\nare enumerated together, it may not be possible to determine in which town a \r\nspecific head of household lived.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p><strong>Background</strong><br>With no precedents, census taking in America was far \r\nfrom uniform in 1790. According to the introduction to <em>Heads of Families at \r\nthe First Census of the United States Taken in the Year 1790, Connecticut</em> \r\n(Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc., 1980), enumerators in New England \r\npresented population by towns or counties, while elsewhere in the new nation, it \r\nwas done primarily by counties. Nationwide, seventeen marshals of the judicial \r\ndistricts supervised the undertaking. They were authorized to appoint as many \r\nassistant marshals in their districts as they deemed necessary (approximately \r\n650 in all). Each assistant was assigned a district to enumerate that could \r\ncomprise one or more counties, cities, towns, townships, or parishes. </p>\r\n<p>Apparently the federal government provided little assistance to the marshals, \r\nwho may actually have received instructions from governors of their states. Each \r\nenumerator did receive a copy of the Census Act of 1790. Although Massachusetts \r\nfurnished forms, marshals in other states had to devise their own forms on paper \r\nthey themselves supplied. Completed schedules varied in length from a few inches \r\nto several feet and all were handwritten on handmade paper of very uneven \r\nquality. Many contained blots, erasures, and misspellings, as well as errors in \r\ncopying and counting, as any researcher who has looked at microfilms of the \r\noriginal records can attest. Enumerators made two copies of each return. They \r\nposted one locally for information and corrections and sent the other to their \r\ndistrict marshal for forwarding to the President.</p>\r\n<p>The objects of the first census were two-fold: to determine how to apportion \r\nrepresentation to the lower house of Congress and to obtain information about \r\nthe military and industrial potential of the new nation. Thus, an accurate \r\naccounting of males old enough for military service or full-time work (free \r\nwhite males sixteen years of age and over, in particular) was of primary \r\nimportance. Indians were neither taxed nor counted. Free persons, including \r\nindentured servants, mulattos, and free blacks of both sexes, were listed \r\nseparately, as were slaves. </p>\r\n<p>Enumerators of 1790 often encountered suspicion and hostility. Citizens \r\naccustomed to the freedom of the frontier feared federal control and questioned \r\nmotives for government inquiry into their personal affairs. Others feared an \r\nincrease in taxes or that divine retribution would follow an enumeration of all \r\nthe people. </p>\r\n<p>Human problems were compounded by difficult working conditions. Roads were \r\npoor to nonexistent, travel was slow, inns were scarce, and town and county \r\nboundaries were not always clear. In spite of these problems, most enumerators \r\nmet the deadline of nine months with a reasonably accurate counting of residents \r\nwithin their districts. Pay was based on the number of persons counted. The rate \r\nfor the backcountry was $1.00 for each 150 persons counted, and in counties \r\nwhere population was more dispersed, pay could be as high as $1.00 for every 50 \r\npersons. In cities or towns with more than 5,000 persons, pay was $1.00 for \r\nevery 300 persons. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Connecticut Towns with Alphabetical Listings</strong><br>Considering the \r\ndifficulties and limitations associated with taking the first census, how can we \r\nexplain why some enumerators went to the additional work of alphabetizing their \r\nlists when it was not required? Hartford County census enumerators listed \r\nalphabetically, apparently by sections of towns, residents of Berlin, \r\nGlastonbury, and Hartford. In Litchfield County, residents of Bethlem [sic], \r\nCornwall, Harwinton, Kent, New Milford, Southbury, Warren, Washington, \r\nWatertown, and Woodbury were also placed in alphabetical order. In Middlesex \r\nCounty, only residents of the town of Chatham were listed alphabetically and in \r\nTolland County, only the residents of Stafford. Names of heads of households in \r\nFairfield and New Haven counties were not alphabetized. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Connecticut Towns Listed Together</strong><br>Under \"Errata\" on page 8 of \r\n<em>Heads of Families, First Census of the United States, 1790 Connecticut</em>, \r\nthe fact that twelve towns in Litchfield County were all returned under the \r\nheading \"Litchfield\" is mentioned but not explained. Those towns included \r\nBarkhamstead, Canaan, Colebrook, Goshen, Hartland, Litchfield, New Hartford, \r\nNorfolk, Salisbury, Sharon, Torrington, and Winchester. No notation explains \r\nlisting together residents of all the towns of New London County, making it \r\ndifficult to determine exactly where in New London County any individual head of \r\nhousehold lived. Separating towns listed together might be possible if it could \r\nbe shown that the marshals completed one town before beginning the next.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Separating the Towns of Norwalk and Stamford</strong><br>In Fairfield County, \r\nDavid Maltbie was assistant marshal for the towns of Greenwich, Norwalk, and \r\nStamford. For reasons unknown today, he listed residents of Greenwich \r\nseparately, yet listed residents of Norwalk and Stamford together. In 1790 \r\nStamford included all of Darien, then called Middlesex Parish, and part of New \r\nCanaan, called Canaan Parish. Norwalk included the remainder of Canaan Parish as \r\nwell as Wilton. </p>\r\n<p>About 1980 the late Lois Bayles, then librarian at the New Canaan Historical \r\nSociety, worked out the route the 1790 census enumerator took through Canaan \r\nParish. Drawing on her extensive knowledge of the settlement pattern of the \r\narea, she found that the enumerator moved along in a very orderly manner, from \r\nhouse to house and street by street. At certain points the enumerator followed a \r\nroad from Canaan Parish into Norwalk or Stamford and then returned to Canaan \r\nParish.</p>\r\n<p>Using Mrs. Bayles' study, I set out to determine whether additional divisions \r\nbetween Norwalk and Stamford towns and parishes could be established. The 1790 \r\ntax list for the town of Stamford, kept at the Stamford Historical Society, \r\nprovides a contemporary listing of Stamford heads of household. In addition to \r\ntaxpayers in Stamford, this list includes names of taxpayers in the parishes of \r\nMiddlesex and Canaan in Stamford. Since a poll tax was included, most adult \r\nmales were taxed, and hence listed. Logically, residents not included in the \r\nBayles study of Canaan Parish or in the Stamford/Middlesex Parish tax list \r\nprobably lived in Norwalk. </p>\r\n<p>In the 1790 Connecticut census, the names of families who lived on the \r\nNorwalk side of Canaan Parish precede the names of those who lived on the \r\nStamford side. For this reason and because the census listing is entitled \r\n\"Norwalk and Stamford Towns,\" I reasoned that Maltbie began taking the census in \r\nNorwalk and completed that town, including Canaan Parish in Norwalk (plus a few \r\nfamilies living in Middlesex Parish near Norwalk). He then enumerated those \r\nresiding in Stamford and Canaan Parish in Stamford and finally listed residents \r\nof Middlesex Parish (later Darien) in Stamford. With the exception of families \r\nwho lived on or near the town lines, I found fairly clear-cut divisions between \r\ntowns and parishes in the census listing. It is evident that the enumerator did \r\ncontinue along streets that crossed town or parish boundaries. </p>\r\n<p>The divisions between Norwalk, Stamford, Canaan Parish, and Middlesex Parish \r\nare as follows: </p>\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<table width=\"89%\" border=\"1\" class=\"contentTableText\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\"><strong>Town or Parish</strong></td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\"><strong>Begins With</strong></td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\"><strong>Ends With</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">&#160;</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">&#160;</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">&#160;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Norwalk</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Mott, Reuben</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Sterling, Thaddeus</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Canaan Parish/Norwalk Exception: Canaan/Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Elles, John<br>Hanford, Samuel</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Hanford, Alexander</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Norwalk Exceptions; Middlesex Parish Stamford </td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Reed, Abigail<br>Reed, Thaddeus<br>Selleck, Nathaniel</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Bishop, Jacob</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Canaan Parish/Norwalk Exceptions: Canaan Parish/ Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Hanford, Levi<br>Benedict, Caleb<br>Weed, Abraham<br>Boutain, \r\nEleazer<br>Gray, Hannah<br>Silliman, Samuel<br>Silliman, Dr. Joseph</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Waring, Solomon</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">&#160;</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Kellagg, Nathan</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">&#160;</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Norwalk</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Green, Caleb</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Kellagg, James</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Canaan Parish/Norwalk Exceptions: Canaan Parish/Stamford \r\nMiddlesex Parish/ Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Benedict, Thomas 2nd<br>St. John, Caleb<br>Comstock, Thomas</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Raymond, William</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Norwalk</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Arnolds, Isaac</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Birchard, Jemima</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Canaan Parish/Norwalk</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Birchard, James</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">St. John, Matthias</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Norwalk Exceptions: Middlesex Parish/ Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Clinton, Joseph<br>Waring, Enoch<br>Raymond, Abraham</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Wilson, Charles</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Webb, Samuel</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Hait, Uriah</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Canaan Parish/Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Hait, Samuel, Junr</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Young, Robert</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Webb, David, Junr.</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Crissy, Nathl, Junr.</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Canaan Parish/Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Young, Mary</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Stevens, Abraham</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Stevens, Amos</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Howard, Sarah</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Canaan Parish/Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Dan, Nathaniel</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Weed, Steven</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Middlesex Parish/Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Stevens, Obadiah</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Stevens, Sarah</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Stevens, Admer</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Waterbury, Thankful</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Middlesex Parish/Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Weed, Silvanus</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Waterbury, John</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Canaan Parish/Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Seely, Jonas</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">Seely, Ebenezer</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"49%\">Middlesex Parish/Stamford</td>\r\n<td width=\"31%\">Bates, John Junr.</td>\r\n<td width=\"20%\">End of listing</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>In the Stamford portion of the census, there are sixteen heads of households \r\nlisted for whom I found no other indication of Stamford residency. Their names \r\ndo not appear on the 1790 Stamford tax list or in any other extant town records. \r\nIt is, however, likely that most or all did live in Stamford. They include \r\nAbigail Smith, Darius Peck, Martin Dissabrose, Capt. Nathanial Starr, Janus \r\nWaterbury, Widow Elizabeth Comestock, Widow Molly Smith, Lewis M. Donald, Widow \r\nMary Wilson, Augustus Wilkes, Amos Stevens, Jr., Isaac Stevens, Sarah Howard, \r\nZepeniah Slason, Widow Esther Seely, and Joseph Sudmore. Of the six women on the \r\nlist, four were widows. Without knowing the names of their husbands, tracing \r\nthem is difficult. In addition, economic conditions of aged widows often \r\nprecluded taxation. Women lacked the right to vote and hence did not pay a poll \r\ntax.</p>\r\n<p>Numerical results of this somewhat arbitrary division of Norwalk and Stamford \r\nresidents in 1790 indicated Norwalk had 858 family heads and a population total \r\nof 4,759, while Stamford had 756 family heads and a population total of 3,980. \r\nSixteen family heads and a population total of seventy-one persons are not \r\nplaced. I may have unintentionally placed some families in the wrong town and \r\nwill be happy to hear from readers who have information I lack.</p>\r\n<p><em>An earlier version of this article, as well as photocopies of pages from \r\nthe 1790 Connecticut census, appeared in</em> Connecticut Ancestry <em>32 (May \r\n1990):163-172</em>.</p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/1790-connecticut-census/", "published": "May 21, 2002", "id": 46}, {"author": "Harlan R.

It also lists sources for \r\nseveral significant omissions from and corrections to the collection.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><strong>A \r\nBrief History of the Collection</strong><p>Lucius B. Barbour was appointed Connecticut&#8217;s examiner of public records in \r\nJune 1911. With a desire to compile the state&#8217;s vital records, he began \r\ntranscriptions himself, and he worked with different sponsors to publish the \r\nrecords of several towns. The pace of this approach was impossibly slow, and he \r\nhired James N. Arnold, the compiler of Rhode Island vital records, using Barbour \r\nfamily funds. Arnold was to copy the vital records in the possession of each \r\ntown clerk of Connecticut. By 1932 this compilation was complete, each record \r\nwas typed onto an index slip, and an alphabetical listing was prepared for each \r\ntown. Sadly, Lucius B. Barbour died in 1934, just two years after the completion \r\nof this work.</p>\r\n<strong>What&#8217;s In It and Where to Find It</strong><p>There are over one million slip entries for vital records in some 439 trays \r\nat the <a href=\"http://www.cslib.org/\">Connecticut State Library</a>. Besides \r\nthe core Barbour Collection itself, these slips include entries from eight towns \r\npreviously published <sup>1</sup> and from six private compilations of vital \r\nrecords <sup>2</sup>. A copyist typed the slips from the handwritten \r\ntranscriptions by Arnold and others. As with any transcription, a few errors \r\nwere introduced, but each entry cites the specific source and this facilitates \r\nreference to the primary record.</p>\r\n<p>The Barbour Collection is listed alphabetically in a separate book for each \r\nof the 137 towns, including records for Norwich and Woodstock supplementing \r\nthose published earlier. The State Library holds a copy of each book, and a copy \r\nwas sent to each town clerk. The town books are labeled &#8220;The Arnold Copy&#8221; and \r\nare known to many town clerks only by that name.</p>\r\n<p>The slip entries, covering the entire state alphabetically on seventy-nine \r\nreels, and the books for each town on seventeen reels are available on microfilm \r\nthrough the Family History Library (<a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\">http://www.familysearch.org/</a>) and in \r\nmany repositories. The <a href=\"http://www.genealogical.com/default.cfm?AFID=1132\">Genealogical Publishing \r\nCompany</a> of Baltimore recently published the town books in paperback format. \r\nThe complete fifty-three volume series is available in many libraries, and \r\nindividual volumes may be ordered from the publisher.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Chronology of Vital Records Statutes in Connecticut</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>The records in the Barbour Collection reflect the extent to which each \r\ntown clerk complied with these statutes. </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>1640</strong> &#8211; The first relevant statute: \"The Magestrate who solemnizeth \r\nMariedge betwixt any, shall cause a record to be entered in Courte of the day \r\n&amp; yere thereof.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>1644</strong> &#8211; Town clerks to record marriages and births with name of &#8220;the \r\nparent&#8221; (often just the father) for a fee of 4d. for each marriage and 2d. for \r\neach birth. The penalty for default was 5sh.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1650 </strong>&#8211; Town clerks to keep records of all births, deaths, and \r\nmarriages, receiving 3d. for births and deaths and 6d. for marriages. The \r\npenalty for default was 5sh. Clerks to submit an annual transcript to the \r\nSecretary of the General Court. Only Windsor complies fully, and for just a few \r\nyears. Hartford and Fairfield kept only a few records. These transcripts were \r\nincluded in Barbour for each of the three towns.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Ahnentafel\"><strong>1694</strong> &#8211;\"Ordayned ministers of the severall \r\nplantations\" granted liberty to \"joyne in mariage such persons as are qualifyed \r\nfor the same.\" This was the first such permission granted for clergymen. \r\nMarriages earlier were considered a civil matter and were conducted only by \r\nmagistrates.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1702</strong> &#8211; Requirement for submitting transcripts to the General Court, \r\nlong neglected, is formally dropped from the code of statutes.</p>\r\n<p><em>From the beginning, some clerks kept regular records of vital events, \r\nroughly in chronological order. Many others complied only very loosely, \r\nrecording marriages and births only in family groups. In this format, few deaths \r\nare found except for minor children and for wives predeceasing their husbands. \r\nThen, beginning with the 1820 marriage statute, virtually every town complied, \r\nthough some failed to make entries in a new, separate book as mandated.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>1820</strong> &#8211;\"An Act for the Due and Orderly Celebrating of Marriage\" \r\nprovides for publication of intentions, persons authorized to conduct marriage, \r\nand consent of parents to underage marriage.

It was \r\ngratifying to learn that his interest in the surname had been \r\nintensified by references to it in my own volume on West Riding surnames<sup>2</sup>.\r\n My interest in Nelstrop had been purely objective, for I had been \r\nstudying the evolution and early history of surnames in Swillington, a \r\nparish that lies a few miles to the east of Leeds, and I had simply \r\nnoted that a man named de Nelesthorpe was listed as a resident there in a\r\n subsidy roll of 1335. As there were other examples of the surname in \r\nthat locality, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, it seemed \r\nlikely that it had its origins in that neighbourhood and was already \r\nhereditary by that time. The 'de' makes it clear that it derived from a \r\nplace-name but, unfortunately, there appeared to be no such place \r\nlocally; nor indeed was I able to find any place named 'Nelsthorpe' in \r\nthe numerous volumes of the English place-name series -- the \r\nresearcher's first and most complete source of information on that \r\nsubject<sup>3</sup>. <br><br>Peter Nelstrop's account of the name \r\nconcentrates on the period from about 1500. It paints a convincing \r\npicture of the familys modest expansion in Yorkshire, notably in and \r\naround Ackworth, while also providing evidence of two significant \r\nmigrations to two localities where the surname is now concentrated, one \r\ninto Lincolnshire in the south-east and another to Stockport, near \r\nManchester, in the west. Although his book has some weaknesses, \r\nparticularly where sources are concerned, it contains useful maps and is\r\n well illustrated with pictures of Nelstrop homes, Ackworth church and a\r\n windmill once in the family's possession. <br><br>Other topics of \r\ninterest include some discussion of the name Nelthorpe, a significant \r\nvariant spelling, and reference to a certain Rowland Nelstrop, said to \r\nhave sailed with John Smith and to have been involved in the \r\nestablishment of Jamestown. Peter Nelstrop wisely leaves open the vexed \r\nquestion of the surname's origin and meaning, although he has gathered \r\nsome of the earliest references and investigated one or two of the \r\npossibilities. It is that unsolved origin which has prompted me to \r\nre-examine the records and offer an explanation -- one I believe has \r\nsignificant and more general implications. <br><br>In a particularly \r\nimportant township gazetteer for West Yorkshire, there is an \r\nilluminating comment on the parish of Swillington, the village where the\r\n surname de Nelesthorpe was recorded in 1335. It was said that \"the \r\ngrowth of the modern village of Swillington has obscured the fact that \r\nin the mid-nineteenth century Swillington church was an isolated \r\nstructure. The settlement pattern of the township was one of small \r\nscattered groups of houses, a number of which bore names containing the \r\nelement thorp, of which Gamblethorpe and Hollinthorpe are two examples.\"<sup>4</sup>\r\n Other examples are Bullerthorpe and Leventhorpe but, as was said \r\nearlier, there is no evidence of a place named Nelsthorpe. However, \r\ncloser examination of the way in which the suffix <em>thorp</em> was \r\nbeing used in the Middle Ages points to a possible explanation for that \r\nomission. <br><br>This important place-name element is known to have a \r\nScandinavian origin and to mean a secondary settlement or outlying \r\nhamlet. It is particularly common in those areas settled by the Danes in\r\n the ninth century. However, <em>thorp</em> remained in use as a word \r\nfor a considerable time after the Norman Conquest, continuing to \r\ndescribe new secondary settlements, many of which were established in \r\nthe twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when the population was expanding.\r\n It has been said, for example, that Oakerthorpe in Derbyshire \"was \r\nprobably named from Ulkel, whose son Robert was living there in 1224\" --\r\n proof that such places \"could be the personal property of one manle and\r\n be named after him\" <sup>5</sup>. <br><br>An even more explicit example\r\n occurs in an Inquisition at Dringhouses near York, where \"Thomas \r\nBustard held one messuage with eight bovates of land in Bustardthor\" in \r\n1275. Thomas was a direct descendant of Osbert Bustard of Thorpe near \r\nYork, living in ca.1180. In this case the <em>thorp</em> came to be \r\nknown as Bustardthorpe through its association with the Bustard family<sup>6</sup>.\r\n The editor noted that the place- name was no longer in use and the \r\nprecise location of the settlement was not known.<br><br>I had already \r\nnoted the influence of this type of development when discussing the \r\norigin of <em>Fawthorpe</em> and <em>Fawthrop</em>. Both of these names \r\nderive from an unidentified 'Fauvelthorpe' in Broughton near Skipton, \r\nreferred to in the fourteenth century, when the <em>thorp</em> belonged \r\nto the Fauvel family<sup>7</sup>. Now it seems that Nelstrop, a typical \r\nYorkshire derivative of Nelesthorpe, is likely to have a similar origin,\r\n commemorating one of the outlying hamlets in Swillington, which now \r\nappears to be \"lost.\" Of course it may be that the thorp was given a new\r\n prefix after the de Nelesthorpes moved away from the parish, and that \r\nit survives as either the <em>Gamblethorpe</em> or <em>Hollinthorpe</em>\r\n mentioned above, neither of which has been noted before the nineteenth \r\ncentury. <br><br>As a Robert de Neulesthorp witnessed a local deed in \r\n1294, along with Hugh de Swillington<sup>8</sup>, it now seems likely \r\nthat the surname dates back to the thirteenth century and that the first\r\n element must be 'Neule' or 'Nele,' either as a forename or a family \r\nname. Without additional evidence it is difficult to identify the \r\nindividual or family involved, but the signatures of <em>Hugone filio \r\nNoil</em> and <em>Thoma filio Nigelli</em> (Neal), which are among the \r\nwitnesses to a Swillington charter of ca. 1180 <sup>9</sup>, offer two \r\npossibilities. </p>\r\n <p><br><strong>Footnotes</strong> </p>\r\n <ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>P. \r\nNelstrop, <em>Racing the Nelstrops</em> (Hebden Bridge: privately printed,\r\n 1998). </li>\r\n<li>G.

Less well known, but \r\ndeserving of wider publicity, is the work he has done with The Names \r\nProject Group, now under his direction at Sheffield University. The \r\ngroup had its origins in a class provided by the Division of Adult \r\nContinuing Education tutored by Dr Hey and Professor Widdowson. The \r\nnumber of active participants in this informal research group has varied\r\n over the years, ranging between ten and twenty, but since its \r\nfoundation they have been responsible for several publications that are \r\nimportant sources for genealogists and family historians, particularly \r\nfor those with ancestors in South Yorkshire.<br><br>For genealogists \r\nwith a general interest in surname studies the group has produced a \r\nbooklet that examines the origins and history of many of the most \r\ncharacteristic names in and around Sheffield. It includes, for example, \r\narticles on Shirtcliffe, Revell, Stacy, Newbold, Dungworth and Scholey, \r\nall family names significant in the seventeenth-century settlement of \r\nNew England and Pennsylvania<sup>2</sup>. Also included are several \r\nimportant surnames that have not been dealt with in any of the major \r\nEnglish reference publications.<br><br>Another rich seventeenth-century \r\nsource is the group&#8217;s database on the masters and apprentices in the \r\nmanufacture of cutlery, an industry for which Sheffield was once \r\ninternationally famous. When a boy was apprenticed to a member of the \r\nCompany of Cutlers his name was entered in the records, together with \r\nthe name, place of residence, and occupation of both his father and his \r\nmaster. There were also details of the length of time he was expected to\r\n serve and the date when he finally became a freeman of the company. \r\nThese records were originally printed in 1906, with the data arranged in\r\n alphabetical order of apprentices names, but because so much valuable \r\ninformation was &#8220;buried in the text&#8221; it was decided to computerize all \r\nthe records, a task that has been completed. The lists published in the \r\ngroup&#8217;s booklet provide the masters&#8217; names in alphabetical order for the\r\n period 1624-99, and an appendix names over two hundred cutlers for the \r\nyears 1614-15<sup>3</sup>. The fact that almost 4,000 apprentices&#8217; names\r\n are listed gives some idea of the scope of the records. Again there are\r\n many names in the lists, in addition to those already quoted, that \r\nimportant to American genealogists, including, for example, Backhouse, \r\nBingham, Hancock and Fretwell. These two publications can now be studied\r\n in comparison with the Hearth Tax Returns for South Yorkshire, \r\npublished by the group in 1991<sup>4</sup>.<br><br>More recently the \r\ngroup produced a valuable and interesting source for the townships in \r\nthe Wapentake or &#8216;Hundred&#8217; of Staincross, a district that covers the \r\nupper valleys of the rivers Don and Dearne and includes the important \r\ntowns of Barnsley and Penistone<sup>5</sup>. The new publication \r\nprovides a complete transcript of the militia lists of 1806 and has a \r\nvaluable introduction, which discusses the accuracy of the lists and the\r\n problems associated with their use. It also has a note on similar \r\npublications and provides details of useful guides to militia lists in \r\ngeneral.<br><br>These Staincross lists are a prime source of information\r\n about more than 3,000 men a generation or so before the first census \r\nreturns, and they have been prepared for publication with family \r\nhistorians very much in mind. They demonstrate how individuals can be \r\nidentified, for details of each man&#8217;s age and occupation are provided \r\nand, in the case of married men, the number of children is also given. \r\nThere were, for example, nine John Taylors in Staincross in 1806, two of\r\n whom had three-child families. <em>However</em>, John Taylor of \r\nThurlstone was a cloth dresser, thirty years old and blind in one eye, \r\nwhereas John Taylor of Cawthorne was a cordwainer, thirty- two years old\r\n and &#8216;poor. &#8217; The group has carefully analyzed this data, which again \r\nhas been computerized, in conjunction with other sources. This approach \r\nallowed the editors to make perceptive comments about the movement of \r\nfamilies and individuals in an area much greater than the Wapentake \r\nitself. The published returns are presented in tabular form, first by \r\ntownship then in alphabetical order of surnames.<br><br>David Hey&#8217;s most\r\n recent work on names has not been confined to organizing research on \r\nthe Names Project, and two additional articles that may not have come to\r\n the attention of North American researchers should be mentioned. The \r\nfirst appears as the third part of a recent town history. It concerns \r\nMahlon Stacy, a well-documented Sheffield Quaker who left Handsworth in \r\n1678 and settled on the banks of the Delaware. The article comments on \r\nthe use of the unusual given name Mahlon, tracing it to the kith and kin\r\n of the Stacys over a 200-year period, and also examines the close-knit \r\nQuaker community in Handsworth, as well as the status of numerous \r\nfamilies from that area who transported &#8220;themselves to an island in \r\nAmerica called west Jarsay&#8221; in the 1670s!<sup>6</sup><br><br>Finally \r\nmention must be made of a groundbreaking article on the surnames of \r\nStaffordshire, a county which has so far not been written about in the \r\nEnglish surnames series<sup>7</sup>. David Hey first of all draws our \r\nattention to several important sources, both published and unpublished, \r\nincluding the work of Michael Paffard<sup>8</sup> and Edgar Tooth<sup>9</sup>\r\n and a &#8220;truly remarkable and unique source&#8221; that lists over 51,000 names\r\n in the Archdeaconry of Stafford<sup>10</sup>. In looking at the origins\r\n and distribution of such distinctive surnames as Salt, Wedgewood, \r\nTellwright, Eardley, and Wooliscroft, the author displays an exemplary \r\ntechnique, one that all genealogists interested in surname studies would\r\n be well advised to follow. The maps and statistics that accompany the \r\narticle add substance to David Hey&#8217;s comment that &#8220;one has only to dip \r\ninto the hearth tax returns for different parts of England to realise \r\njust how strong were the regional patterns of surname distribution three\r\n centuries ago.&#8221;<br><br><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>\r\n<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>D.

As I \r\nexplained that county was a French term, adopted under Norman rule as \r\nequivalent in meaning to the earlier English word shire, I realized that\r\n much of what the English take for granted in their history can be \r\npuzzling to others. The word shire was used in the Old English period to\r\n describe an administrative district, one ruled jointly by an `alderman'\r\n and a sheriff, the officers who presided in the shire-moot, that is the\r\n meeting or meeting-place for the shire. The title of sheriff, or \r\nshire-reeve was given to the chief officer of the shire.</p>\r\n<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p>Not all \r\nthe shires became counties under the Normans, and those who travel \r\naround England or work with old documents will at times encounter names \r\nsuch as Hallamshire and Hexhamshire, which refer to former jurisdictions\r\n smaller than a county. Although shire survives in many county names, \r\nthere are many others that do not have the suffix, ranging from Cornwall\r\n in the extreme south-west to Kent and Essex in the east and \r\nNorthumberland and Cumberland in the far north.</p>\r\n <p>The Domesday \r\nentry (1086) for Yorkshire is Eurewicscire, but by the 1400s forms such \r\nas le counte d'Everwyk were usual, reflecting the change described \r\nabove. However, in this largest of the English shires there is an \r\nadditional complication, for Yorkshire was formerly divided into three \r\n'ridings' or `thirdings,' north, east, and west, whose boundaries \r\nconverged on the city of York. The Scandinavians frequently divided \r\nlarge areas into three parts and `thirding' became riding when the \r\ninitial `th' or `t' was lost, having coalesced with the final consonant \r\nof north, east, and west. Typical spellings that reflect this are \r\nNortrithing (1198) and Northrithing (1240). The former Anglo-Saxon \r\nkingdom of Lindsey (Lincolnshire) was also subdivided into three parts \r\nby the Scandinavians and had north, south and west ridings, and the \r\nclear inference in both cases is that the divisions were made subsequent\r\n to the Danish settlement of 876. There was actually a period early in \r\nthe history of New England when `riding' was used as a territorial name,\r\n and it is perhaps to be regretted that it did not survive.</p>\r\n <p>Northumberland\r\n as a county covers a much smaller area than the old kingdom of \r\nNorthumbria, which formerly consisted of the land north of the river \r\nHumber, the dividing line between Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, but the \r\ncounty name has been in use since the early twelfth century. There are \r\ntwo other northern counties with the suffix `land'--Westmorland, the \r\ndistrict of the people who lived west of the moors, i.e. the uplands of \r\nthe Northern Pennines, and Cumberland, the region of the `Cymry' or \r\nWelsh. The `Welsh' in this case were those Celts who were not subdued by\r\n the English of Northumbria until the seventh century. Other county \r\nnames that commemorate Celtic tribes are Devon, referring to the \r\n`Dumnonii', and Cornwall, the place of the `Cornovii.' The suffix in \r\nCornwall can be compared with Wales, for both derive from the Old \r\nEnglish word for foreigners.</p>\r\n <p>In this much fought-over corner of \r\nthe island there are two more distinctive `folk-names,' both with the \r\nelement `set,' which meant settlers or dwellers. Somerset was the area \r\nof the settlers around Somerton, the `summer dwelling' and Dorset was \r\nthe area of the settlers around Dorn. This word is also a Celtic \r\nsurvival, meaning a sports place, and it is found in Dorchester, the \r\ncounty town.</p>\r\n <p>On the eastern side of the country Celtic names are \r\nunderstandably rare, for it was there that the invading Anglo-Saxons \r\nlanded. Nevertheless, there is the name Kent, `the land of the Cantii,' \r\nthought to be the name of a Celtic tribe but with a much-disputed \r\nmeaning. East Anglia, where the Anglians first settled, is not a county \r\nname but a region, subdivided into Norfolk, the `northern people' and \r\nSuffolk, the `southern people,' whilst their contemporaries are \r\nremembered in Essex, Middlesex, and Sussex, respectively the territories\r\n of the East, Middle, and South Saxons. Wessex, the land of the West \r\nSaxons, was revived as a name by eighteenth-century antiquarians, but it\r\n has not survived as a county, despite its historical significance. \r\nSurrey, `the southerly district,' though a much less important name, \r\nidentifies the land of the Saxons south of the Thames who were \r\nsandwiched between east and west.</p>\r\n <p>In fact many of the Anglo-Saxon\r\n shires did not commemorate tribal divisions but were formed \r\nartificially and took their name from an important town or estate. \r\nTypical of these are the West Midland towns of Hereford, Stafford, and \r\nShrewsbury, the last of these eventually giving rise to Shropshire. On \r\nthe same pattern are the early Wessex foundations of Hampshire \r\n(Southampton) and Wiltshire (Wilton) and also such East Midland names as\r\n Derbyshire, Leicestershire, and Nottinghamshire. These last three all \r\nlay within the Danelaw, and whereas the Anglo-Saxon shires were created \r\nfor defence, the Danish shires were created around their army \r\nheadquarters.</p>\r\n <p>A few shire names have very distinctive histories. \r\nCounty Durham, as it is usually called, was created out of lands \r\nbelonging to the Bishop of Durham, who effectively had sovereign powers.\r\n His territories were referred to as a palatinate, which was temporarily\r\n abolished during the Civil War and then revived after the Restoration, \r\nsurviving well into the nineteenth century. Rutland, the tiniest county \r\nof all, probably came into being ca.1200, for it had that status in 1204\r\n when it was granted by King John to Queen Isabella as dower. Before \r\nthat the southern part of the territory had been part of \r\nNorthamptonshire. Lancashire's distinction lies in the allusive quality \r\nof the name itself, which is a shortened form of `Lancastershire.' \r\nLancaster means the `Roman fort on the river Lune,' and this is yet \r\nanother example of a river name that goes back at least to the Celts and\r\n cannot be satisfactorily explained.</p>\r\n <p>Much has been written \r\nrecently about the `homes' of English surnames and the regions into \r\nwhich the country can still be divided. Genealogists can understand this\r\n regionalism far better if they come to terms with the historic \r\ndivisions and differences that shaped Englishmen over the centuries. Not\r\n surprisingly, many of those differences have survived the sweeping \r\nboundary changes of the early 1970s.</p>\r\n</div></div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/english-origins-and-sources-3/", "published": "", "id": 50}, {"author": "George Redmonds", "country": "England", "title": "English Origins and Sources IV", "content": "<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p>I spent the month of August last year in Kansas, working on English \r\ndocuments which are vital to an understanding of local and family \r\nhistory in the part of West Yorkshire where I now live. In fact, with \r\nthe library's help, I was able to locate and transcribe many hundreds of\r\n deeds which formerly belonged to the Kaye family of Woodsome Hall and \r\nwhich, with a few exceptions, have no known counterparts in England. The\r\n earliest items in the collection date back to the thirteenth century, \r\nand the latest to the 1700s, but the vast majority are title deeds from \r\nthe Tudor and Stuart periods.</p>\r\n <p>The collection is housed in the \r\nSpencer Library in Lawrence, the rare books, manuscripts, and archives \r\nlibrary of the University of Kansas. It is located in the Department of \r\nSpecial Collections, which is a broad-based rare books and MSS library \r\nwith an international reputation. The manuscripts division contains \r\nabout 300,000 items, primarily from Europe (including Britain), Latin \r\nAmerica, and the US, and it concentrates on the humanities and natural \r\nhistory. Few of the manuscripts have been published. They are seen by \r\nthe library as primary sources for use by researchers: all readers are \r\nwelcome in the library, but the manuscripts must of course be used \r\nwithin the Department. Among the sample of `broad subject areas' listed \r\nin a brief introduction to the Department's holdings are the following \r\ntantalizing headings: (1) British family papers (letters, legal \r\ndocuments, financial accounts, diaries, etc.) largely 17th to 19th \r\ncenturies, and (2) Several thousand miscellaneous British deeds, 14th to\r\n 19th centuries.</p>\r\n <p>Among those miscellaneous deeds are two \r\ncategories temporarily entitled The Yorkshire Deed-Box Collection and \r\nHuddersfield Area Deeds. These were the items that had first attracted \r\nmy attention, and a brief explanation of how they came into the \r\nUniversity's possession is a help to intending researchers. A paper \r\nprepared by Ms. Ann Hyde, the Department's Curator of Manuscripts, tells\r\n how in 1969 the Department bought two groups of British deeds and \r\nestate papers from the English book-dealers Hofmann-Freeman. One \r\nconsisted of about 5,000 unsorted and supposedly miscellaneous items, \r\nthe other, containing about 4,000 roughly sorted deeds, was from \r\nKirtling Tower, a seat of the notable North family, who had extensive \r\nestates in the south of England.</p>\r\n <p>The entire shipment arrived in \r\nthe United States in parcels, made up it seems by the book-dealer. Once \r\nin Lawrence they were classified as `H-F' and `North' and a student gave\r\n the contents temporary numbers, providing scratch cards for all the \r\nitems. These cards contained the temporary number, and bare details of \r\nthe date, the parties involved and place names, where possible. The \r\nlibrarian's impression was that material from `North' had somehow found \r\nits way into `H-F' and vice-versa. An English archivist was hired to \r\nhandle the collections and worked on them between 1982 and 1985. As a \r\nresult there was some re-arrangement and re-boxing, but apparently it is\r\n not now always clear which items she handled, and some may have been \r\nmisplaced. Work on classifying these deeds continues.</p>\r\n <p>It was Ms. \r\nHyde who first realized that a significant number of deeds related to \r\nplaces in and around the West Yorkshire parish of Huddersfield, although\r\n not to Huddersfield itself, and she informed the West Yorkshire Archive\r\n Service of the collection in 1991. Because the office was then \r\nshort-staffed, Ms. Hyde's letter was sent to me, and I was asked if I \r\ncould help. It was immediately clear to me that the deeds had to do with\r\n the estate of the Kayes of Woodsome and were likely to provide the key \r\nto several important chapters in the history of the family and the \r\nestate. And so it proved this last summer, when the research carried out\r\n in Lawrence was finally analyzed. The Kayes may not have been major \r\nlandholders in the national context, but the search produced significant\r\n material for no fewer than twenty townships in West Yorkshire, \r\nclarifying the history of numerous farms and hamlets. </p>\r\n <p>Moreover \r\nthere proved to be even more valuable genealogical evidence in the deeds\r\n than I had dared to hope. I had of course expected that new light would\r\n be thrown on the various branches of the Kayes in and around Almondbury\r\n parish, and on the gentry families with whom they were directly linked.\r\n But there were also among the deeds marriage settlements, inquisitions \r\npost mortem, testamentary documents, copies of court roll and much else,\r\n all with direct evidence relating to the families who were tenants or \r\nneighbours of the Kayes. The total of such families or individuals comes\r\n to more than fifty, and includes such significant names as Saltonstall,\r\n Copley, Armitage, Dean, Lockwood, Crosland, Ramsden and Nettleton.</p>\r\n <p>Since\r\n returning from Lawrence I have been able to compile a detailed calendar\r\n of the Yorkshire deeds, complete with place-name and surname indexes. \r\nNow it will be possible to make this particular section of the British \r\ncollection in Kansas more widely available. Two things should not be \r\nforgotten, though. First, there are significant complementary \r\ncollections for the Kayes's estate in England, both at the estate office\r\n of their successors, the Earls of Dartmouth, and in the Leeds section \r\nof the West Yorkshire Archive Service. Second, the Kaye material in \r\nKansas amounts to no more than six or seven percent of the full British \r\ncollection. No doubt there are still many exciting disc</p>\r\n</div></div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/english-origins-and-sources-4/", "published": "", "id": 51}, {"author": "George Redmonds", "country": "England", "title": "My Name is Wood: The Woods of Halifax", "content": "<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p>The surname Wood is usually dismissed in a few \r\nwords when mentioned in reference works pertaining to surnames. The \r\nmeaning is given as something like &#8220;dweller in or near a wood.&#8221; In <em>The\r\n Homes of Family Names</em> (1890), author H.B. Guppy identifies the \r\nsurname as common in most English counties. It is also generally&#8212;and \r\ncorrectly&#8212;assumed to have had multiple origins, unlike more specific \r\nnames such as Woodhead. The inference is that the genealogist is \r\nunlikely to be able to identify an individual family source, and that is\r\n not good news for those New Englanders who can trace themselves back to\r\n families arriving in America in the 1600s. Many English surnames are \r\nvery distinctive and can be seen to belong to one English region but \r\nunfortunately that is not the case with Wood.</p>\r\n<p>Occasionally\r\n the surname may have an alternative explanation. In P.H. Reaney&#8217;s <em>A \r\nDictionary of English Surnames</em>, the author quoted one or two early \r\nexamples of by-names which seem to derive from the Middle English word \r\n&#8220;wod(e),&#8221; which meant &#8220;frenzied or mad.&#8221; However, there is no evidence \r\nthat any of these ever became hereditary. Much more interesting is Dr. \r\nReaney&#8217;s evidence that both Wood and Woodward may have derived from an \r\noccupational meaning. However, even if we disregard these possible \r\nalternatives, the meaning and the origins of Wood are both of \r\nconsiderable interest, and this becomes clear once we look more closely \r\nat the word&#8217;s semantic history.</p>\r\n<p>Students of the\r\n English landscape know that most of the country was once covered by \r\nwoodland, yet the full story of its transformation has never been told. \r\nOliver Rackham opened our eyes to much of its history in <em>Trees and \r\nWoodland in the British Landscape</em> (1976, revised 1990), but even he \r\ncould tell us little about its origins. Rackham writes that we have no \r\nmemory in England of our pioneering days and that the first wildwoods \r\npassed away in prehistory, leaving neither written record nor legend. \r\nThat is not to say that the woods themselves vanished from the landscape\r\n for that would not be true. Research will show that much of our \r\nwoodland was cleared even before the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons, but \r\nthe considerable areas that remained were almost certainly &#8220;managed,&#8221; in\r\n order to provide our ancestors with the implements and building \r\nmaterials they so desperately needed. </p>\r\n<p>Even \r\nafter the Norman Conquest, at the time when surnames were stabilizing \r\nand each village or community was surrounded by its pastures and plowed \r\nland, &#8220;the wood&#8221; still lay beyond that ring of cultivation. &#8220;The wood&#8221; \r\nwas home to many wild creatures and provided a barrier between \r\nneighboring communities, one that had to be traversed by the medieval \r\ntraveler. We can find out about the managed woodland that surrounded \r\nvillages in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries from studying written \r\nrecords, maps, place-names, and the boundaries and fences of the \r\nlandscape itself. </p>\r\n<p>These prove to us that many \r\nplaces named Wood and Woodhouse commemorate a phase of &#8220;colonization&#8221; in\r\n the medieval period, as the population increased significantly, and \r\nbefore its dramatic decline during the Black Death. In my own immediate \r\narea there are many townships which have a hamlet nearby named \r\nWoodhouse, e.g. Huddersfield, Emley, Rastrick, Shelley, and Cartworth. \r\nThere is also Woodsome, near Farnley Tyas, which once meant &#8220;at the \r\nhouses in the wood,&#8221; a dative plural. When these houses of hamlets were \r\nestablished, between 650 and 1000 years ago, they formed islands of \r\ncultivation in &#8220;the wood.&#8221; Many of them gave rise to hereditary \r\nsurnames. In Halifax, the surname appears to have at least two distinct \r\nsources, one in Fixby and the other in Ovenden, but there are references\r\n also to Woods in Sowerby, and the origin is more complicated than first\r\n impressions suggest.</p>\r\n<strong>The Woods of Fixby</strong>  <p>A\r\n charter of c.1200 refers to &#8220;thirteen acres&#8230;of the assart (i.e. \r\nclearing) in the wood of Fekesbi,&#8221; granted to William the clerk and his \r\nheirs, and the minor place-names suggest that this was close to where \r\nthe isolated farm called &#8220;the Wood&#8221; still stands. The earliest example \r\nof a surname associated with the locality is found in the court rolls. \r\nJohn del Wode appears in 1276 and thereafter the family is mentioned at \r\nfrequent intervals into the mid-1600s. Recognition is not always \r\nstraightforward: in some of the earliest documents the name is Latinised\r\n as &#8220;del Bosco&#8221; and in others it is written &#8220;att Wodd,&#8221; but the line of \r\ndescent is reasonably clear.</p>\r\n<p>The family \r\nremained at &#8220;the Wood&#8221; until about 1570, and a conveyance of 1580 \r\nclarifies this crucial episode in their history. Agnes, wife of the \r\ndeceased Edward Saltonstall of &#8220;the Wood&#8221; occupied the farm at that \r\ntime. She was the &#8220;daughter and heiress of John Wodd, late of Wodd&#8221; and \r\nthe farm was put into the hands of trustees until their son Edward \r\nshould come of age. Not long afterwards the widow married a neighbor, \r\nThomas Brook, and in 1609, Edward Saltonstall, junior, sold the farm to \r\nJohn Thornhill, the lord of the manor of Fixby.</p>\r\n<strong>The Woods of \r\nOvendon</strong>  <p>Clearance was also taking place in \r\nOvenden in the 1200s and there are charters that refer to assarts there.\r\n One of these clearings, aptly called &#8220;Riding,&#8221; was leased in 1276 to \r\nHenry de Myggelay, who was granted &#8220;estovers&#8221; (wood rights) &#8220;in the wood\r\n of Ovenden, for burning.&#8221; In an undated deed, Matthew del Bosco, \r\nelsewhere called Matthew del Wode, witnessed a similar grant to Robert \r\nde Grenehirst, although his rights were to wood for house-building and \r\nfencing. </p>\r\n<p>The surname Wood expanded more \r\nsuccessfully in Ovenden than in Fixby. A subsidy roll of 1545 indicated \r\nthat four branches of the family were taxed there, not to mention other \r\nWood families in Sowerby, Warley, Southowram, and Heptonstall, all in \r\nthe same parish. It is impossible to say how many different families \r\nthis involved but there are two points worth noting. The first is that \r\nthere is no reference in Ovenden to a tenement or holding called Wood \r\nassociated with the surname. The second is that a Matthew Wood was \r\nwitnessing Fixby deeds in the early 1300s, at the very same time that a \r\nMatthew Wood was witnessing Ovenden deeds. There is also firm evidence \r\nthat a man of this name acquired land in parts of Sowerby, so it is at \r\nleast a possibility that all the Halifax Woods share a common origin in \r\nFixby in the mid-1200s. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Sources and Further\r\n Reading:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Matthew Wood, &#8220;English Origins of\r\n the Mitchell, Wood, Lum and Halstead Families&#8221;<br><em>The New York \r\nGenealogical and Biographical Record</em>, Jan. 1989, Vol. 120, No. 1.</p>\r\n<p>P.H.

In c.1115, for example, &#8220;Reynerus cancellarius,&#8221; that is, \r\nReyner the chancellor, was apparently living in Norfolk, and in c.1310 \r\n&#8220;Ricardus filius Reyneri&#8221; (Richard the son of Reyner) held land in \r\nYorkshire. The Normans brought the name to England, although like the \r\nmore popular Richard and Robert it was really of Germanic origin. P.H. \r\nReaney, in <em>A Dictionary of English Surnames</em>, offered <em>Raginhari</em>\r\n as the original version, made up of two elements like other typical \r\nGermanic names, and he explained these as &#8220;counsel &#8211; army.&#8221; However, \r\nneither the meaning nor the pronunciation would have survived among the \r\nNormans, and their influence on it is apparent in the Domesday entry <em>Rainerus.</em>\r\n Although it was not one of the most popular Norman names it occurred \r\nquite frequently up to the end of the thirteenth century and \r\noccasionally in the 1300s, when many surnames were stabilizing. By 1400 \r\nit had fallen out of general use but it was not extinct and isolated \r\nexamples were recorded into the seventeenth century. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Rayner, Reyner - a surname</strong></p>\r\n<p>As a surname, Rayner is not confined to one area of the country and \r\nthe evidence suggests that it had a number of origins in different \r\ncounties. According to H.B. Guppy in his <em>Homes of English Family \r\nNames</em> (1890), it was particularly common just over one hundred years\r\n ago in Essex and he found good numbers also in both Norfolk and \r\nSuffolk. The only other county where he recorded it as a common name was\r\n Nottinghamshire, where Rayner and Raynor featured side by side.The \r\nconcentration in East Anglia points to one or more origins in that area \r\nand Richard McKinley&#8217;s more recent work in the English Surnames Series \r\n[i]supports that, for he has commented on its popularity in both Norfolk\r\n and Suffolk in the 1520s, a generation before we can pick up evidence \r\nmore generally in parish registers. </p>\r\n<p>There are three positive points there for family historians, \r\nparticularly for those whose roots appear to be in Nottinghamshire or \r\nEast Anglia: the &#8220;meaning&#8221; seems clear, the name is associated with one \r\nor two precise locations, and no evidence of unusual variations in \r\nspelling has been put forward. The problem though, as in so many cases, \r\nis not what is said about the name but what has been left unsaid, and it\r\n should not be assumed that Guppy, McKinley, and others have left us \r\nwith no work to do. [ii]In fact there are one or two aspects of Rayner&#8217;s\r\n origin and distribution that benefit from a closer look at its history \r\nin Yorkshire. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Rayner - a Yorkshire surname</strong></p>\r\n<p>The surprise is that Guppy found no concentration of the surname in \r\nYorkshire. It is certainly very common there now, in the triangle formed\r\n by Bradford, Leeds, and Huddersfield, with many hundreds of families \r\nlisted in current telephone directories. Furthermore, the returns of the\r\n hearth tax of 1672 prove that it has a long history in that area, with \r\nthirty-nine Rayners concentrated in and around the parishes of Hartshead\r\n and Birstall. Elsewhere in Yorkshire at that time it was absent or very\r\n uncommon, even in Bradford, Leeds, and Huddersfield, the three more \r\nimportant places that I used to define its present distribution. All \r\nthis suggests that its earlier history in Birstall and Hartshead is \r\nworth looking at. </p>\r\n<p>It would be possible but tedious to list examples of the surname in \r\nthese two places going back generation after generation, right to the \r\nfirst parish register entries, but we can at least comment on its \r\ndistribution in that area in 1545 when twenty-four Rayners were taxed. \r\nOnce again, Birstall and Hartshead were at the heart of the \r\nramification, with seventeen Rayners there and most of the others in \r\nadjoining parishes such as Batley. There were scattered examples in \r\nother parts of the county but generally it was not at all common. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Reyner the Fleming</strong></p>\r\n<p>This name appears at intervals in west Yorkshire records from the \r\ntwelfth century and it may suggest that in this instance Reyner was not \r\nNorman but Flemish. The family had substantial estates in the county, \r\nnotably in the widely dispersed parishes of Skipton, Dalton, Clifton, \r\nand Wath. Significantly, Clifton is in Hartshead parish and it was there\r\n in c.1180 that Reiner le Fleming confirmed a grant of the Priory of \r\nKirklees to the nuns. The same personal name reappeared in subsequent \r\ngenerations and, in 1306, at the inquisition post mortem of William le \r\nFleming, the incoming heir was named as Reyner, aged thirty-three. As \r\nlate as 1393 another Reiner le Fleming was granted free warren (hunting)\r\n rights in his demesne lands of Dalton and Clifton. Although the Fleming\r\n family had lands in the Hartshead area, where the surname Rayner first \r\noccurred, there is no suggestion that they were directly responsible for\r\n its origin. However, it is worth noting how long they kept faith with \r\nthe personal name long after it had fallen out of favor elsewhere, and \r\nit is certainly possible that it was given by them to local godchildren.\r\n </p>\r\n<p><strong>Rayner in Rastrick</strong></p>\r\n<p>The surname originated in Rastrick, just across the river from \r\nClifton (which lay in the same manor) and it is there that its \r\ndevelopment can be traced in the court rolls. These survive from 1274 \r\nand, at a court meeting that year, John, the son of Reyner, gave 12d for\r\n licence to take &#8220;1&#189; acres of land in Rastrick from Adam del Croftes.&#8221; \r\n[iii]We know nothing about Reyner himself but it is unlikely that he was\r\n a member of the prestigious Fleming family, as his descendants were \r\nsaid to be &#8220;nativi&#8221; or villeins. In 1315, for example, Thomas, the son \r\nof John Reyner &#8220;nativus,&#8221; gave &#8220;2s as a heriot on 4 acres in Fykesby \r\nafter his father&#8217;s death.&#8221; [iv]John had earlier purchased three acres of\r\n free land and Thomas had to pay a heriot of 12d on these. The line of \r\ndescent seems clear enough here but &#8220;Reyner&#8221; was still what we call a \r\nby-name or patronymic, that is, a non-hereditary name meaning &#8220;son of \r\nReyner.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>There was also a Richard (son of Reyner) in the roll of 1315, his \r\nname appearing alongside those of Thomas and John le Fleming, and this \r\nseems to suggest that Reyner was stabilizing as a hereditary surname. \r\nConfirmation of that is found in the roll of 1350 where John Rayner was a\r\n Rastrick tenant. He was described more precisely as John, the son of \r\nThomas Reyner, when he gave &#8220;8d for licence to heriot on a messuage and \r\nthree acres in Rastrick, after the death of Thomas his father.&#8221; He was \r\nthe fourth in line of descent and described there as his father&#8217;s heir. \r\nAlthough the surname&#8217;s more general history after 1350 is less \r\nstraightforward, we know that it survived the Black Death, for it is \r\nfound in and around Rastrick through the 1400s. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Early migration</strong> </p>\r\n<p>The first record of the surname across the river in Hartshead parish \r\nis in 1467 when William Rayner served as the constable for Clifton. \r\n[v]In 1470 Thomas Rayner &#8220;of Birstall&#8221; witnessed a grant of lands in \r\nLittle Gomersal, [vi]and in 1487 Gilbert Rayner was the constable for \r\nHartshead. None of these families lived more than a mile or two from \r\nRastrick but the basis for the expansion noted in the tax rolls of 1545 \r\nand 1672 was clearly in place. One feature of that expansion was the \r\nfamily&#8217;s adoption of less common first names and among those recorded in\r\n the early 1500s were Marmaduke, Lionel, Wilfrid, Charles, and Humphrey.\r\n These had all been rare during the years when the surname was \r\nestablishing itself and their use by 1545 was by no means universal. </p>\r\n<p>___________________________________________________________________<br><br>The\r\n early examples of Rayner in New England fit comfortably into this brief\r\n history of the surname. Thurston Rayner who arrived with his family in \r\nWatertown, Massachusetts, in 1634 was from the Suffolk parish of \r\nElmsett, close to Essex, and Humphrey Reyner of Rowley, Massachusetts, \r\nwas from Batley, no more than a mile from Birstall and six from \r\nRastrick. In 1545 a Humphrey Rayner of Batley was one of the very few \r\nmen in the county to bear that first name. </p>\r\n<hr width=\"33%\" align=\"left\" size=\"1\">\r\n<div id=\"edn1\"><p>[i]The English Surnames Series was started back in 1965 at Leicester \r\nUniversity. Richard McKinley published a monograph on Norfolk surnames \r\nin 1969 and his volume on <em>Norfolk and Suffolk in the </em><em>Middle \r\nAges</em> appeared in 1975. He also comments on Rayner in later volumes. </p>\r\n</div><div id=\"edn2\"><p>[ii]Most popular writers on the subject are content to pick up on the\r\n positive evidence. Cottle, for example, says of Rayner/Raynor that it \r\nis an East Anglian and Nottinghamshire surname, with Raynor found in \r\nNotts. He is likely to have taken this straight from Guppy without \r\ncarrying out any research of his own into the names&#8217; distribution. </p>\r\n</div><div id=\"edn3\"><p>[iii]Many of the earliest rolls have been transcribed in five volumes\r\n published by the Yorkshire Archaeological Society, in their Record \r\nSeries.

While essentially a\r\n needle-in-a-haystack undertaking, the trip did introduce me to a \r\nfascinating period source. A footnote in <em>The London Surveys of Ralph \r\nTreswell</em>, a book of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century &#8220;surveys,&#8221; or\r\n plots, of properties in London, led me to <em>Records of the Worshipful \r\nCompany of Carpenters.</em> These are published transcriptions of the \r\nrecords of the London Carpenters' Company. It turns out, of course, that\r\n these volumes are included in the library of NEHGS as well. [i] </p>\r\n<p>The Carpenters&#8217; Company is among the oldest livery companies of \r\nLondon. Its existence is recorded from 1333, and its records survive \r\nfrom the early 1400s. Like all such guilds, the Carpenters&#8217; Company \r\noversaw the works of its members by regulating prices and materials, and\r\n governed all aspects of the trade within the city limits of London. The\r\n companies also exercised many charitable functions, such as the \r\nmaintenance of sick and aged members, widows of members, and gifts to \r\npoor people within London. It is primarily in this capacity that the \r\nCompany functions still.</p>\r\n<p>Six volumes of these books were published in the early twentieth \r\ncentury, with a seventh volume done in 1968. The original volumes of the\r\n Carpenters' Records are held at the Guildhall Library in London, but \r\nthese transcriptions save a great deal of eye strain. The wealth of \r\ndetail found in these records is astounding, and they provide matter of \r\ninterest to social historians as well as genealogists. The content of \r\nthe seven volumes is scattered; they do not proceed in chronological \r\norder. For instance, the first volume contains apprenticeship bindings \r\nfor the second half of the seventeenth century, while volume two starts \r\nthe warden&#8217;s accounts with fifteenth- and sixteenth-century records. </p>\r\n<p>The thousands of apprenticeship bindings in these records are \r\nengrossing. Marsh&#8217;s introduction from 1913 indicates the usefulness of \r\nthese records to those interested in the fabric of English life in the \r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries: &#8220;&#8230;for while the greatest care in \r\npreservation of records may show an appreciation of their dormant value,\r\n publication reveals a more intelligent apprehension of their active \r\nvalue as original documents in the social history of London and \r\nEngland.&#8221; [ii] </p>\r\n<p>The wealth of information contained in the apprenticeship bindings \r\nwill be of great interest to the genealogist. The Carpenters' Company in\r\n their statutes of 1607 outlined the terms under which a master and his \r\napprentices might set up their arrangements. These differed very little,\r\n if at all, from any of the companies of London. [iii] </p>\r\n<p>Marsh&#8217;s introduction includes some instruction found in the \r\nCarpenters' Company court book of 1600-1618:</p>\r\n<blockquote>Quere to be made when you bind an Appr. <br>what is the boys\r\n name who is to be bound<br>what is his Father&#8217;s name if living and \r\nwhere<br>if dead where did he live and in what County or Citty<br>what \r\ntrade doth he follow or was of when living <br>To whom is he to be bound\r\n <br>where doth the mr live <br>for what Time when to begin <br>at a \r\ntyme past or to come <br>md an Appr cant be bound for lesse than 7 years\r\n according <br>to law from the tyme of the binding <br>for 7 years from \r\nthe date of these present Indentures <br>from the day next before the \r\nday of these presents &amp; the date of <br>these presents <br>for 8 \r\nyears from Xmas last past <br>for 7 years from the first of June next \r\nensueing [iv] </blockquote>\r\n<p>Because most of the apprenticeship bindings usually do follow these \r\nguidelines, the genealogical benefit of these records is apparent. By \r\nproviding the place of origin, as well as the father&#8217;s name and \r\noccupation, these become very helpful in determining a family&#8217;s English \r\norigins. Another insight provided by these detailed records is the \r\nincredible number of apprentices who came from all counties to London to\r\n try their luck at life in the city. Considering that these records are \r\njust one company of many, the number of men coming into London as \r\napprentices was quite significant. </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Friday the 6<sup>th</sup> day of October 1654</p>\r\n<p>Richard Parrett son of Ro: Parrett late of Lillingston Luffin in the \r\nCounty of Oxon husbandman deceased hath put himselfe apprntice to \r\nBartholomew Knight to serve for seaven yeares from the day of the date \r\nabovewritten; dated the day &amp; yeare aforesaid. [v] </p>\r\n<p>November the third 1654</p>\r\n<p>Alexander Reader the sonne of Wm Reader late of Saffron in the County\r\n of Essex Carpenter decd hath put himselfe apprntice to Thomas Woodhouse\r\n of the parish of Allhallows Staininge to serve for Seaven yeares for \r\nthe day of the date abovewritten dated etc. [vi] </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Some entries even include the section of London the master lives in, \r\nas this one from July of 1655, in which Thomas Barnes of Harlington, \r\nBedford, put himself apprentice to &#8220;Thomas Clarke of Pye-Corner for 7 \r\nyeares from the day of the date aforesayd.&#8221; [vii] </p>\r\n<p>These records show that most of the carpenter&#8217;s apprentices were from\r\n outside of the city, but occasionally there are records of London \r\ncitizens apprenticing their sons in the city. In this case, it is a \r\ncarpenter enrolling his son as his own apprentice. Between August of \r\n1660 and 1683 the entries were rendered in Latin:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>29<sup>o</sup> Octobr: 1660 Willielmus Stanfield filius Willielmi \r\nStanfied Civis et Carpentar London per Indram po: se appren: eidem willo\r\n Stanfield Civie et Carpentar patri suo de Cowe lane pro 7 ann a 1<sup>o</sup>\r\n die Novembr: prox sequen Dat eodem 29<sup>o</sup> die Octobr: 1660.&#8221; \r\n[viii] </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The social history aspect of these records is evident in the typical \r\npayments made regularly by the Company. These include pensions and alms \r\npaid to widows of company members, as well as a scholarship to a student\r\n at Oxford. Also, payments were regularly made to those usually un-named\r\n people who prepared and cleaned the hall and the gardens for the \r\nnumerous company dinners. </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Paid to the Scavenger iii<sup>s<br></sup>Paid to the Parson v<sup>s<br></sup>Paid\r\n to Joane Rapley here Yeares pencion xvj<sup>s<br></sup>Paid to Anne \r\nMorris her Yeares pencion xiij<sup>s</sup> iiij<sup>d<br></sup>Pd to \r\nJoane Preistly her yeares pencion x<sup>s</sup></p>\r\n<p>Pd to John Abbott a Schollar for his halfe yeares pencion ending at \r\nChristmas 1608 &#8211; xl<sup>s</sup> and paid him more at the feast of \r\nThannunciation of our Lady 1609 according to an order of Court one \r\nYeares pencion aforesaid being iiij<sup>li</sup> which was sent to him \r\nto Oxford upon his letter soe paid him in all vj<sup>li</sup></p>\r\n<p>Geven in Charitye at Michaelmas to Alice Griffyn xviij<sup>d</sup>, \r\nto Alice Hay Ward xviij<sup>d</sup> , to Hamblett Deane vj<sup>d</sup>, \r\nto Hellen Biggens xviij<sup>d</sup>, to Margaret Martyn xviij<sup>d</sup>,\r\n to Robert Hutchinson xviij<sup>d</sup>, to John Curtys xviij<sup>d</sup></p>\r\n<p>Geven in Charity at Christmas to 3 poore people v<sup>s<br></sup>Geven\r\n in Charity att Midsomer to severall poore people of this Companye vj<sup>s</sup>\r\n ij<sup>d</sup></p>\r\n<p>Paid for making cleane the hall, washing the linen, and scouring the \r\npewter xxiij<sup>s<br></sup>Paid for weeding and watering the garden vij<sup>s<br></sup>Paid\r\n for hooping and mending the Tubbs this Yeare iij<sup>s</sup> iiij<sup>d</sup>\r\n [ix] </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>A basic function of the company was to regulate members&#8217; goods, \r\nservices, and attendance at company functions. One important aspect of \r\nthe London trades was the employment of \"foreign\" craftsmen. These \r\n&#8220;foreigners&#8221; in London were not just workmen from beyond England, but \r\neven English carpenters from outside of London, or those who were not \r\nmembers of the company. While their frequent presence in the records \r\nindicates that they were a regular part of London work, they were \r\nregulated closely and not officially tolerated. In 1567, the company \r\nrecorded a fine of ten shillings &#8220;&#8230;of Stephen Furnes a fine for settinge\r\n a forrein on worke in his house.&#8221; Likewise, &#8220;Receaved of Robert Piggot \r\nfor not gevinge knowledg of a forrein wch did worke in his yard&#8221; a fine \r\nof three shillings four pence. Apparently one could use foreigner \r\ncarpenters, by paying for a &#8220;license&#8221; from the company, as in this \r\nrecord: &#8220;Res of Richard bolt bowyer a fine to have lycence to sett two \r\nforreins on worke for a wek.&#8221; To use these non-company carpenters cost \r\nBolt three shillings four pence as well. [x] </p>\r\n<p>The company also regulated attendance and behavior of its members. \r\nThere are cases where members were fined for slander: &#8220;&#8230;Robert Cawsey a \r\nfine wordes spoken against certaine worke done by Mr Abbottes svauntes&#8221; \r\nwas fined 2 shillings 6 pence. Members were also required to attend \r\nfuneral services for other members or their wives, Roger Rainoldes was \r\nfined twelve pence &#8220;for not cominge to the buryall of John Holdgattes \r\nwyf&#8221;. </p>\r\n<p>Materials were inspected at the &#8220;water syd&#8221; for size and quality and \r\npenalties were given if said goods did not measure up.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Receaved for fines at the water syd viz<br>Receaved of Henrye \r\nStrodwike a fine for iiij C of planche board iiij<sup>s<br></sup>Res of \r\nThomas Huet for that his bordes did not beare measuer ij<sup>s</sup> vj<sup>d<br></sup>Res\r\n of ( ) Kinge for lath not kepinge the Lengthe ij<sup>s</sup> vj<sup>d<br></sup>Res\r\n of mr Ebdgrave for two hundred of bordes &amp; two pale bordes wch was \r\nforrein bought &amp; forrein sold at harmans [Harman brookes] wharf viij<sup>s</sup>\r\n viij<sup>d</sup> [xi] </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Each volume in this series contains a few detailed indices; usually a\r\n name index, a general index, and, in some volumes, a place-name index. \r\nEach volume also includes an appendix or two. These vary in their \r\ncontent; some are lists of masters, wardens, or apprentices. Others \r\ninclude leases and deeds concerning company properties, wills of \r\ncarpenters, etc. Appendix I in volume 2 is a transcript of the company&#8217; \r\nordinances from 1486/7. </p>\r\n<p>My original starting point in this London research was a reference \r\nthat indicated Anthony Messenger was first a warden of the Carpenters' \r\nCompany in 1615, 1617, and 1620. He became master of the company in \r\n1622. I decided to focus on records pertaining to him, in an effort to \r\nmake a connection between Anthony of London and Henry of Boston. I have \r\nso far not been able to make any such connection, but along the way, \r\ncame up with many records concerning Anthony. The first mention of him \r\nis his apprenticeship in 1577: </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>John Jackson ys admitted to have as his apprentice Anthonie Messenger\r\n of the age of Nyntene years the sone of John Messenger of Walton in the\r\n countie of Comberland husbandman for the terme of seaven years \r\nbegyninge at the feaste of the Purification of St Marie the Virgin laste\r\n paste before the date hereof [xii] </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Anthony Messenger was made free of the company in 1584, and took his \r\nfirst apprentice in 1592: </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Anthonie Messenger presented to be his apprentice Thomas Okey of the \r\nage of xix years the sone of William Okey of Dowtswell in the county of \r\nGlouc husbandman for the tearme of seven years begyninge at the feast of\r\n St Michaell next ensuing (18 Tewsdaie &#8230; xxixth of Awgust 1592) [xiii] </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>His next apprentice was contracted seven years later, thus presumably\r\n when Thomas Okey was made free:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Res of Anthony Messenger for presentinge of Henry Yeomans son of John\r\n of Godstowke in County Northampton laborer for eight years from our \r\nLady Day 1599 ij<sup>s</sup> ij<sup>d</sup> [xiv] </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In 1604 Anthony Messenger took two apprentices: &#8220;William Ballett \r\nsonne of John Ballett of Wells in the County of Somersett yeoman \r\ndeceased for seaven yeares from the feast of Phillipus and Jacobus \r\nThappostles 1604&#8221; and &#8220;John Bawden sonne of George Bawden of Worsoppe in\r\n the County of Nottingham cooke deceased for seaven years from \r\nMichaelmas 1604&#8221; [xv] </p>\r\n<p>In undated records that seem to also be from 1604, Anthony Messenger \r\nhas &#8220;translated&#8221; or turned over to him &#8220;George Jackson late Apprentice \r\nto Patrick Reddye Deceased.&#8221; Perhaps to accommodate George Jackson, \r\nMessenger turned over his new apprentice, William Ballet, to John \r\nBallet. By 1606 William Ballet had been turned over again, this time to \r\nThomas Freeborne. [xvi] </p>\r\n<p>In 1608 Messenger presented as his apprentice &#8220;Andrew King sonne of \r\nAndrew King of Ashbury in the County of Berks husband(man) Deceased for 7\r\n yeares&#8230;&#8221; At that point, Messenger paid a fine of five shillings to the \r\ncompany for having an &#8220;apprentice extraordinary viz one Andrewe King.&#8221; \r\nAndrew King was the third apprentice that Messenger had at the time, \r\nwhen he was only allowed two. Members of the company could have an \r\nextra, or &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; apprentice by paying a fine for each one over \r\nthe limit. [xvii] </p>\r\n<p>Apprentices continued to come and go regularly through Messenger&#8217;s \r\nshop. George Jackson was made free in 1608, leaving him with Andrew King\r\n and John Bawden. He took a new apprentice in 1611: &#8220;Thomas Harker the \r\nsonne of William Harker of Halsopp in the Countye of Lancaster \r\nhusbandman for Seaven yeares from Thannunciacion of our Ladye 1611.&#8221; \r\nAgain, he was in a position where he had to pay a fine &#8220;for the goodwill\r\n of the howse to have an Apprentice extraordinarye viz Thomas Hawker.&#8221; \r\n[xviii] </p>\r\n<p>Anthony Messenger died in 1634 and was buried at St Alphage, London \r\nWall. His final apprentice, perhaps a relative, Anthony Messenger, was \r\nturned over to Thomas Rushall:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Anthony Messenger, son of James of Cumbd yeo appd 14 Jan 1631/2 to \r\nAnthy Messenger, then to Thos Rushall Made free 28 April 1640 [xix] </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<div><strong>About the author:</strong> <em>Peter Follansbee has studied\r\n traditional woodworking since 1978, and has been the joiner at Plimoth \r\nPlantation since 1994.

It is not \r\nenough to use one of the standard surname dictionaries, for the help they can \r\ngive is probably more limited than most researchers realise. Such reference \r\nworks are concerned with meaning and etymology rather than with family history, \r\nand the truth is that we are likely to learn far more from a name&#8217;s historic \r\ndistribution than from its linguistic origins. Fortunately, there are now \r\nexcellent sources available that will help in that respect, and I hope to \r\nillustrate that by looking at one group of surnames &#8212; Whitham, Whittam, Whitwam, \r\nWhitwham, and Witham.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p><strong>The Dictionary Approach</strong></p>\r\n<p>In his <em>Homes of English Family Names</em>, H.B. Guppy &#160;makes no mention of \r\nany of these names, and two of them, Whitwam and Whitwham, find no place in the \r\nrevised editions of Reaney and Wilson&#8217;s <em>Dictionary of English Surnames</em>, \r\nthe standard national dictionary.[i] We might therefore infer that most of the \r\nnames are quite rare, and yet that would not be true. In Reaney and Wilson \r\nneither Whitham nor Whittam has its own entry, and both are cross-referred to \r\nWitham. The explanation offered there is that all these surnames derive from the \r\nplace-name Witham, and our attention is drawn to localities so called in Essex, \r\nDevon, Lincolnshire, and Somerset. The three names quoted all relate to Essex in \r\nthe period up to 1327. Of course, some surnames were hereditary by 1327, but we \r\nshould remind ourselves that examples from that early period often referred to \r\nby-names rather than to hereditary surnames. In such cases the names might still \r\nchange from one generation to another.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Distribution in 1881</strong></p>\r\n<p>The study of the distribution and expansion of surnames in England can reveal \r\nmuch about their history and origins, and Steven Archer&#8217;s <em>British \r\n19<sup>th</sup> Century Surname Atlas</em> CD-ROM for the census year 1881 \r\nprovides us with excellent information on both these topics (see <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"my previous  column\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/the-british-19th-century-surname-atlas/\">my previous  column</a> for detailed information on the Archer CD). [ii] The totals for the \r\nsurnames under investigation are: Whitham (1743); Whittam (1099); Whitwam (696); \r\nWhitwham (84); Whitham (1202). It is the distribution, however, seen first by \r\ncounty and secondly by poor law union, that is most \r\ninformative.<br><br><strong>Whitham (1743)</strong> The major concentrations for this \r\nsurname were in Yorkshire (982) and Lancashire (477). These two north midland \r\ncounties share a common boundary, and the name was especially prolific in \r\ntowns such as Rochdale and Burnley in Lancashire, and their Yorkshire neighbours \r\nTodmorden, Halifax, and Bradford. The only other county with a significant \r\nnumber was Essex (48).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Whittam (1099)</strong> Here also the major concentrations are in Lancashire \r\n(729) and Yorkshire (216). Again the name appeared most frequently in the towns \r\non both sides of the county boundary. There was just one person with the name in \r\nEssex but 43 in Kendal in the northwest. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Whitwam (696)</strong> In 1881 this was almost exclusively a Yorkshire surname. \r\nThe total in the county was 671, and no fewer than 557 of these were resident in \r\nvillages within the Huddersfield poor law union. There were no examples in Essex \r\nand just 18 in Lancashire.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Whitwham (84)</strong> This rare surname was also found almost exclusively in \r\nYorkshire (71), with the biggest concentration in Bradford and Keighley. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Witham (1202)</strong> This was a much more widely distributed surname, and \r\nthere were significant totals in London (276), Essex (144), Nottinghamshire \r\n(101), Yorkshire(137), and Lancashire (98). </p>\r\n<p>We can make sense of these statistics if we use a map to define the areas of \r\ndistribution and look more closely into the linguistic history of each name. The \r\nborder area of Yorkshire and Lancashire, where Whitham and Whittam were most \r\npopular, is well supplied with printed parish registers and tax rolls, and these \r\nbuild up a fascinating sequence of spellings. For example, in Gargrave near \r\nSkipton, Jonathan Whitham&#8217;s name was also spelt Whitwham and Witham \r\n(1709-16);[iii] in the hearth tax for that district we have Joseph Witham \r\n(Thornton in Craven) and Edward Whitwham (Bradley).[iv] The inference is that \r\nall these spellings were possible variants of a single surname.</p>\r\n<p>&#160;If we focus our attention at this stage on the village of Thornton in \r\nCraven, we can trace the surname in printed sources back to 1412 at least. For \r\nexample, a sequence of Tudor rentals and rolls contains the name of William \r\nWitwhame or Whitwham (1522-43). Among his immediate neighbours were several men \r\nwith similar surnames, including Henry Whytwham of Bradley (1525) and Thomas \r\nWhitwham of Carleton (1543).[v] Earlier references in that part of Airedale are \r\nJohn Whitwham of Kildwick (1473)[vi] and Richard Whitwham of Thornton in Craven \r\n(1412).[vii] However, there is no other local evidence before that date, even in \r\nthe very full poll tax return for 1379.[viii] </p>\r\n<p>Of course, these surnames were also numerous in east Lancashire, where \r\nthere is earlier evidence of the surname in the neighbourhood of Colne, which is \r\njust a mile or two south of Thornton in Craven. Typical examples from the court \r\nrolls are Thomas Whitwham (1541), George Qwitqwam (1496), and Robert de Whitham \r\n(1425).[ix] Once again, even though earlier records for that area have survived, \r\nthey contain no references to the name. It seems either that it developed quite \r\nlate, which is quite possible, or that its earlier history lay elsewhere. The \r\nexpansion and distribution of 1881 appears therefore to have its origins in the \r\nborder area around Thornton in Craven, but that is not necessarily where it \r\noriginated. </p>\r\n<p>Before we tackle the question of its possible origins a word should be said \r\nabout the spelling &#8220;Qwitqwam&#8221; noted above. Few genealogists would automatically \r\nassume this to be a variant of Whitwham, but the variation is commonplace and \r\nrepresents the scribes&#8217; attempts to represent the dialect pronunciation of the \r\ninitial \"Wh&#8221;&#8217;. This was heavily aspirated and guttural, and affected all local \r\nsurnames, such as Whitehead, Whiteley, etc. Fortunately, the convention is \r\nfamiliar to most editors, who link the variant spellings in their indexes. For \r\nexample, in the index to the register for Halifax parish, all the following \r\nappear under one heading: Whitwham, Qwitwham, Qwitquam and even Whypwam.[x] </p>\r\n<p>Whitwham is still well represented in Airedale in almost exactly those \r\nlocalities where it was recorded in 1881, and all the way back to 1412. Whitwam \r\nremains common in Huddersfield, notably in the township of Golcar, where it \r\nfirst appeared in the 1530s. Stephen Whitwam of Golcar, a well-known \r\nHuddersfield genealogist, has traced its history and expansion there. The \r\nvariants Whitham and Whittam are now far more popular, especially in the area \r\nbetween Burnley and Bradford, but their common origin, and links to Whitwham, \r\ncannot be in doubt. We must also presume that some local members of the family \r\nended up with the variant Witham, but these are unlikely to be connected \r\ngenealogically with the Witham families in and around Essex. A search similar to \r\nthe one I have carried out here for Whitwham would probably establish the facts \r\nabout its origin.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, we come to the questions of origin and meaning. The early \r\nspellings point to a place-name origin for Whitwham, and that is confirmed by \r\nthe Colne reference of 1425 to Robert <em>de</em> Whitham. Unfortunately, the \r\nplace-name dictionaries of Yorkshire and Lancashire contain no evidence for a \r\nlocality with that name, although it must be said that new evidence continues to \r\nturn up in previously unpublished documents, and a Yorkshire or Lancashire \r\norigin cannot yet be ruled out.[xi] However, the earliest spellings mean that we \r\ncan discount any connection between the northern names and the various places \r\nnamed Witham.</p>\r\n<p>One possibility remains. Just south of Haltwhistle, in Northumberland, \r\nthere is a locality named Whitwham, and this is linguistically the most \r\nplausible source of the name.[xii] Moreover, we can link it with a surname \r\nrecorded in Hexham in Northumberland that appears not to have survived. Two \r\nindividuals have been identified, John of Whitwhame (1479) and Robert Whitqwam \r\n(1496).[xiii] The spellings match those recorded in Thornton in Craven, but an \r\nobvious problem is the distance between the two districts, which cannot be less \r\nthan seventy miles.</p>\r\n<p>The only evidence we have of a link is circumstantial. In the fourteenth \r\ncentury the estates of the Percy family (the earls of Northumberland) included \r\nproperty in Yorkshire, notably in Thornton in Craven, so it is at least a \r\npossibility that the Whitwhams were Percy tenants who moved south in the early \r\n1400s. The meaning of the place-name depends on exactly when it was coined. It \r\nderives from &#8220;hvammr,&#8221; an old Norse word for a small valley, but this passed \r\ninto northern dialects with the more specialised meaning of&#160; &#8220;marshy hollow&#8221;. \r\nEither of these would fit the locality. </p>\r\n<div><hr size=\"1\" align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<div id=\"edn1\"><p>[i] &#160;&#160; H.

No Irish data is available. The \r\nuser can enter any of these surnames and the map displayed on the screen will \r\nimmediately demonstrate its distribution in Great Britain. Even as late as 1881 \r\nmost surnames had distinctive patterns of distribution and many still \r\npredominated in just a single region. The maps clearly illustrate these \r\npatterns. The information can be presented in two different ways, using either \r\nthe counties or the Poor Law union districts to define the regions.

Guppy published his groundbreaking book \r\nentitled <em>The Homes of Family Names in Great Britain</em> (1890)<em> </em>it has \r\nbeen recognized that the distribution of a surname is often the vital clue to \r\nits origin and history. That idea has since been developed in the volumes \r\npublished in the English Surnames Series, which commenced publication in 1973. \r\nVarious attempts have been made in that period to map surname distributions in a \r\nway that would satisfactorily identify the significant areas of concentration. \r\nIt started in my own <em>Yorkshire: West Riding, </em>with statistics extracted \r\nfrom telephone directories and maps drawn by James Wrathall employing \r\ntraditional cartographic symbols. These were designed to illustrate the \r\ndistribution of names such as Raistrick, Culpan, Pogson, and Beanland, and the \r\nramification of Armitage in the West Riding from 1538 to 1800.</p>\r\n<p>Colin Rogers&#8217; <em>The Surname Detective </em>(1995) used maps \r\nbased on data from telephone directories countrywide to investigate the \r\ndistribution of English surnames that were apparently commonplace rather than \r\nobviously distinctive. Against the odds, Rogers was able to produce interesting \r\nresults for such names as Black, Clay, Smith, and Walker. David Hey developed a \r\ndifferent technique in the publication of his 1997 Phillimore lecture, using a \r\ncomputer database developed from data in the civil registration indexes of \r\ndeaths between 1842 and 1846. The &#8220;districts&#8221; shown on his maps were \r\npredominantly those employed by the registrars, although he occasionally found \r\nit convenient to show the counties as they were before the boundary changes of \r\n1974. The same techniques were used in <em>Family Names and Family History \r\n</em>(2000). </p>\r\n<p>Much more recently, Kevin Schurer of Essex University and \r\nBryan Sykes of Oxford created computer-generated distribution maps to support \r\ntheir research in the fields of biology and sociology. The results have been \r\nvery successful and genealogists find much that is valuable in the maps but they \r\nhave never been freely available. Stephen Archer&#8217;s surname atlas CD is therefore \r\nof major importance to all genealogists with British ancestry and it must be \r\nhoped that it will not be too long before similar maps for earlier periods are \r\nmade available. The only realistic resource for such a scheme at present is data \r\nfrom the hearth taxes of 1662 to 1688. </p>\r\n<p>However, the surname maps are not the only reason for my \r\nwholehearted enthusiasm for this newly produced title. These maps also cover all \r\nthe <em>forenames</em> used in 1881, a task that was of secondary importance to \r\nArcher. The fact is that my own research into forenames, which is now just one \r\nof the alternative terms for what we once called Christian names, has made it \r\nclear how distinctive their histories and distributions can be, and these \r\nfindings will be published by the Public Record Office early in 2004. The period \r\nI have covered is from the 1300s to the present day but it is fair to say that \r\nmost of the statistical evidence is for the earlier centuries in that period. I \r\nam delighted therefore to find that forename distribution maps for 1881 make \r\nsuch significant points. </p>\r\n<p>For example, there were 2249 males with the first name Squire \r\nin 1881. This is usually commented on as a nineteenth-century &#8220;status&#8221; coinage, \r\ncomparable with Earl, and yet my own research shows that it was in favour with a \r\nfamily called Firth in west Yorkshire from the mid-1600s, soon passing from them \r\nto their neighbours. Stephen Archer&#8217;s map shows that 1174 of all the &#8220;Squires&#8221; \r\nwere still in Yorkshire in 1881 and another 900 or so were in neighbouring parts \r\nof other counties. It was virtually unknown outside that relatively small area \r\nand seems likely to derive from the surname, which was well established in that \r\npart of Yorkshire. </p>\r\n<p>From the sixteenth century many first names were derived from \r\nsurnames and the distribution maps confirm that these were usually most popular \r\nin the same region as the surnames. The data for Pascoe and Dyson, which are \r\nfrom opposite ends of the country, will illustrate that point. Pascoe is a \r\nCornish dialect variant of Pascall, a word that was originally an adjective \r\nmeaning &#8220;of Easter&#8221; and, in 1881, there were over 2000 families with the surname \r\nin Cornwall, by far the biggest concentration in the country. Other significant \r\nclusters were in London and neighbouring Devon. The pattern for Pascoe as a \r\nfirst name was much the same, with 53 men so called in Cornwall out of a \r\nnational total of 93. </p>\r\n<p>The surname Dyson means &#8220;son of Dye,&#8221; a pet form of Dyonisia, \r\nand its origin was in the tiny hamlet of Linthwaite in west Yorkshire, close to \r\nthe border with Lancashire. The lady in question was Dyonisia of Linthwaite and, \r\nalong with her son John Dyson, she figures in local records from c.1300. In 1881 \r\nthere were over 7500 families with the surname in west Yorkshire and adjoining \r\nparts of Lancashire out of a national total of just over 9000. Dyson as a first \r\nname was borne by 483 men and, of these, 408 were in that same district. Others \r\nwere in neighbouring counties and in London. </p>\r\n<p>There were far more first names with localised distributions \r\nthan most people would imagine and they were of different types. Digory, for \r\nexample, seems to have come into use in the Tudor period, inspired by Sir \r\nDegare, the central figure in a medieval romance. Its initial use was almost \r\nentirely confined to Cornwall and Devon and in 1881 there were still some 50 men \r\nin that region who bore the name. It was unknown in most counties. Similarly \r\nthere were numerous Thurstons in Lancashire, part of a tradition that goes back \r\nto the twelfth century, and Tedbers in Yorkshire - all linked to a much earlier \r\nTheobald. Some Saints&#8217; names and some Old Testament names also had marked \r\nregional concentrations, as did the many Scottish first names that would \r\nsubsequently spread south and dominate the frequency lists for England and Wales \r\nin the early twentieth century. </p>\r\n<p>We can take Colin, the diminutive of Nicholas, as an example. \r\nThere were 4261 males with this name in the census and almost three-quarters of \r\nthese were in Scotland, heavily concentrated in the western half of the country. \r\nThere were just 25 Colins in Wales and 6 in the City of London. Lanarkshire was \r\nthe county with the highest total (661) whilst the highest concentration was in \r\nArgyll, where there were 492 Colins in every 100,000 individuals in the region. \r\nIn Cornwall, by contrast, the ratio was 2 per 100,000, with only 7 men called \r\nColin. The statistics alone are impressive evidence but Stephen Archer&#8217;s maps \r\npresent us immediately with a visual image that says far more than words. It is \r\na brilliant achievement. </p>\r\n<p>This CD-ROM is available for $20 (U.S) or &#163;12 (U.K.) from \r\nArcher Software.

This three-volume work, edited by Carolyn C. Fenwick, \r\nis part of the <em>New Series of the Records of Social and Economic History</em>, \r\npublished for the British Academy by the Oxford University Press. The aim has \r\nbeen to cover all the records of the English poll taxes, county by county, in \r\nalphabetical order. The first volume, covering Bedfordshire-Leicestershire, \r\nappeared in 1998 and was followed by Lincolnshire-Westmorland in 2001. The third \r\nvolume will complete the county sequence and also include indexes, glossaries, \r\nand other information relevant to the series as a whole.</p>\r\n<div id=\"center-column\"><div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p>Poll taxes were something of an experiment, being designed initially to base \r\nthe monies levied on the individual rather than the property. The term \"poll \r\ntax\" was coined to describe the first tax, that of 1377, which was based on a \r\nper capita flat rate of one groat, i.e. fourpence. It was no accident that the \r\nsame name was much more recently applied to the very unpopular tax devised by \r\nthe Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher: no doubt its opponents had in \r\nmind the so-called Peasants' Revolt of 1381. In later years the charges were \r\nonce again made in accordance with each man's ability to pay. In 1379 for \r\nexample, they ranged from fourpence to ten marks and applied to all laypersons \r\n(including foreign merchants) over the age of sixteen. Only the clergy and \r\ngenuine paupers were exempt. </p>\r\n<p>The purpose of the poll tax series is to make these important documents more \r\nwidely available, particularly to social and economic historians, demographers, \r\nand genealogists. Local record societies have made past attempts to transcribe \r\nand publish some of the rolls, and scholars in Yorkshire have been particularly \r\nfortunate to have had access to so many of the early lists.<sup>1</sup> In other \r\ncounties, however, the transcriptions were less accurate than they should have \r\nbeen. There is no doubt that our knowledge of English surname origins suffered \r\nas a result of this carelessness and genealogists must therefore welcome this \r\npresent initiative. The poll taxes project has been a mammoth undertaking, and \r\nCarolyn Fenwick is to be congratulated on her work. The carefully edited lists \r\nprovide us with much new information, and her introductory notes explain how the \r\ntaxes were assessed and collected while also covering important topics such as \r\nexemption and evasion. </p>\r\n<p>It is now generally recognized that most hereditary surnames came into use in \r\nEngland between 1250 and 1450. For that reason alone the poll taxes of 1377-1381 \r\nare of great importance to genealogists and surname scholars. The printed \r\nvolumes show the names of many thousands of people sorted by village, with \r\ndetails about occupations and status. Some relationships are also included. The \r\nmajority of those listed are rarely mentioned in other documents. With the \r\npublication of the poll taxes, we can now view the names of those who survived \r\nthe Black Death, that catastrophic plague which killed such a large percentage \r\nof the population in 1348-49. The volumes also provide a picture of local \r\ncommunities at the very moment when some new surnames were stabilizing. For \r\nexample, John Godwyn, a taxpayer in Syderstone, Norfolk in 1379, is listed just \r\nbelow Godewyn, a man whose personal name was by then so unusual that he seems \r\nnot to have needed a surname.<sup>2</sup> </p>\r\n<p>The county returns are far from uniform and it is impossible to generalize \r\nabout the details contained in the records. However, since Norfolk County was \r\nthe original home of so many New England settlers, examples from their records \r\nwill serve to illustrate the kind of information that American researchers might \r\nhope to find. A simple comparison with the Norfolk men listed by Banks reveals \r\nhow many of the surnames were already established in the county by \r\n1379.<sup>3</sup> These include surnames derived from (1) place-names, e.g. \r\nLincoln, Buxton, Foulsham, Gedney, and Scottow; (2) personal names, e.g. Hobart, \r\nPaine, Houchin, Jacob, and Dogget; (3) occupations, e.g. Baxter, Chamberlain, \r\nFuller, and Cutler; and (4) nicknames, e.g. Knight, True, Grubb, and Swett. Many \r\nmore could be listed of course, some of them apparently commonplace and others \r\nmuch more distinctive, but lists alone would not reveal the potential value of \r\nthe poll tax information.</p>\r\n<p>That information is of particular value when it is linked with details from \r\nother sources, some of them rarely consulted. There are, for example, numerous \r\nreferences in Norfolk in 1379 to the surname Thaxter: Robert and John Thaxstere \r\nlived at Pulham, Thomas Thaxtere at Bagthorpe, and John Thaxtere at Holt, to \r\nname just a few. In other cases the occupation of a taxed individual was given \r\nas \"thaxster,\" proving that the word was still in everyday use. This particular \r\nsurname is described in <em>A Dictionary of English Surnames</em> (1997) as being \r\n\"apparently peculiar to Norfolk.\" There appears to be no reason why such a name \r\nshould be confined to Norfolk for it means \"thatcher\" or \"thacker\" and both \r\nthese are more widely distributed. Surprisingly, Guppy's <em>The Homes of Family \r\nNames</em> (1890) made no mention of this surname. </p>\r\n<p>More recently, Richard McKinley has commented on Thaxter's fascinating \r\ndistribution: in <em>Norfolk Surnames in the Sixteenth Century</em> (1969) he \r\nproduced a map to demonstrate that its main \"home\" in 1523 was in the northeast \r\nof the county. He went on to say that it seems likely that the bearers of such \r\nnames \"are descended from a common ancestor.\" That might seem initially very \r\nunlikely, especially as examples of the by-name were scattered all over the \r\ncounty in 1379. However, we now know that many such by-names either failed to \r\nstabilize as hereditary names or died out in the male line during two centuries \r\nof low population growth - the period of 1350 to 1550. Therefore, a \r\nsingle-family origin for Thaxter is not out of the question. In a later work on \r\nNorfolk surnames, McKinley wrote that \"many of the names occurring during \r\nc.1250-1400 never became hereditary, and&#8230;in other cases families possessing \r\nhereditary occupational surnames became extinct.\"<sup>4</sup> </p>\r\n<p>It is clear that the publication of <em>The Poll Taxes of 1377, 1379 and \r\n1381</em> will open up new areas of research and throw fresh light on the \r\nregional characteristics of English surnames. It is an exciting prospect for \r\ngenealogists, and it comes at a time when we are just beginning to see the role \r\nthat genetics might also play in the subject. There is no doubt that in cases \r\nsuch as Thaxter there are massive new resources available to the \r\ngenealogist.</p>\r\n<sup>1.</sup> \"Rolls of the Collectors in the West Riding of the Lay \r\nSubsidy, 2 Richard II\", <em>Yorkshire Archaeological and Topographical \r\nJournal</em>, Vols. 5-7. <br>\"Assessment Roll of the Poll Tax for Howdenshire, 2 \r\nRichard II\", <em>Yorkshire Archaeological and Topographical Journal</em>, Vol. 9. \r\n<br>E.

It lay in its own extensive \r\ngrounds just below the village of Farnley Tyas and it is little changed today. \r\nThe family had moved there from Bury in Lancashire in the 1370s and were taxed \r\nat Farnley in 1379. John and Margaret Kay paid a 3s. 4d. &#8220;poll tax.&#8221; John was \r\ndescribed as &#8220;Frankeleyn&#8221; in the roll, and the title and the money he paid were \r\nsure signs of his status locally. His servants, John and Agnes, neither of them \r\ngiven a surname, were at the end of the township list, paying 4 pence each. \r\n<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>The family built up a considerable estate in the neighborhood for the next \r\n350 years, but died out in the direct male line by 1726. Nevertheless, the \r\nsurname remained prominent in the neighborhood of Farnley, and there are still \r\nmany Kayes that reside there. Historically it had many variant spellings, but \r\nKaye is now the conventional form locally with well over 200 Kaye families in \r\nthe current telephone directory for Huddersfield, the nearest town. The interest \r\nNew Englanders might have in the Kayes rests on the marriage between Grace Kaye \r\nand Sir Richard Saltonstall, the emigrant. This marriage took place on 28 \r\nNovember 1609 in the parish church of Almondbury, where the Kayes traditionally \r\nworshipped and where their first son Richard was baptised on 1 October 1610. \r\n<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<p>Grace Kaye was the great granddaughter of Arthur Kaye, via his son John and \r\ngrandson Robert, and it is Arthur who is credited with being the architect of \r\nthe family&#8217;s fortunes. His name, alongside that of his wife Beatrix (<em>nee</em> \r\nWentworth), still adorns the massive mantle beam at Woodsome, and yet there has \r\nalways been a question mark over his inheritance of the estate. It should have \r\npassed to Nicholas, the ten-year-old grandson of an earlier John Kaye, whose \r\ninquisition post mortem took place in January of 1498-99. <sup>3</sup>Sir \r\nWilliam Dugdale&#8217;s <em>Visitation of Yorkshire</em> (W. Pollard &amp; Co, Exeter, \r\n1899-1917) named Nicholas as the son of Edward Kaye, who had pre-deceased his \r\nfather. It was the death of Nicholas, in about 1506, which ensured the \r\nsuccession of his cousin Arthur, and documents kept at the Kenneth Spencer \r\nResearch Library in Lawrence, Kansas, throw light on those tragic circumstances. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>The first important document is a marriage settlement dated 3 August 1488. It \r\nrecords an agreement between John Kay, senior, and Matthew Wentworth of West \r\nBretton, that &#8220;Nicholas Kay, son and heir to Edward Kay should take to wyfe \r\nElizabeth doghtere of the seid Mathewe&#8230;the seid exsposelles to be hade&#8230;within \r\nthe space of viij yeres next insuyng.&#8221; There then follows an interesting but \r\ncomplicated series of clauses dealing with the financial arrangements for the \r\nproposed marriage and the various properties on the estate. These include \r\nprovisos about the maintenance of Nicholas and Elizabeth, which would be \r\nprovided until he reached the age of sixteen. Lastly, provision was made &#8220;in \r\ncase Elizabeth die, that Nicholas take another daughter of Mathewe Wyntworth.&#8221; \r\n<sup>4</sup>As Nicholas was said to be ten years old when he was named heir in \r\nhis grandfather&#8217;s inquisition of 1498-99, it is clear that the marriage \r\nagreement must have been drawn up almost immediately after his birth. This in \r\nturn means that his father Edward must have died just a short time before. There \r\nis little question that Edward&#8217;s unfortunate death explains the almost unseemly \r\nhaste with which the infant Nicholas was betrothed to Elizabeth. </p>\r\n<p>In 1504, the &#8220;mariage &#8230; and the custodye of the body of the same Nicholas, \r\nand of the landes&#8221;were granted to Matthew Wentworth for forty marks by Sir James \r\nStrangeways, the Kayes&#8217; overlord, &#8220;unto tyme that Nicholas shall come to his \r\nfull age of xxj yere.&#8221; <sup>5</sup>He was then just 16 years old and we know \r\nfrom his inquisition of 1506 that he must have died before he was 21. \r\nNevertheless it seems that the marriage did take place, although no record of it \r\nappears to have survived. For confirmation of some of the unwritten events \r\nbetween the years of 1504-1506 we are indebted to an entry in the &#8220;Commonplace \r\nBook of John Kaye,&#8221; a document written by Arthur&#8217;s eldest son that is kept in \r\nthe Folger Shakespeare Memorial Library in Washington D.C. In his later years, \r\nJohn wrote that his father &#8220;had the land in his hands about 50 years&#8230;and paid a \r\nfeoffment of &#163;6 13s. 4d. to Mrs. Arthington, <em>my mother&#8217;s sister</em>, during \r\nher life&#8230;before married to Nicholas Kay, heir male of this house who died under \r\nage.&#8221; <sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<p>That entry appears to confirm both the marriage and the death of Nicholas, \r\nbut it proves also that John&#8217;s mother Beatrix was the sister of Elizabeth \r\nWentworth, and therefore another of Matthew&#8217;s daughters, reminding us of how \r\ndetermined the two families had been in 1488 to secure their relationship. \r\nNicholas&#8217;s premature death meant that Arthur had to secure the union, which he \r\nlater commemorated so spectacularly over the hall fireplace. Arthur was the son \r\nof George Kaye, a younger brother of Nicholas Kay&#8217;s father Edward, and his given \r\nname offers us another insight into the Kaye-Wentworth relationship. </p>\r\n<p>The name Arthur was not a popular one in the twelfth and early thirteenth \r\ncenturies but it was recorded often enough to give rise to the hereditary \r\nsurnames Arthur and Arthurs. The name then dropped completely out of favor for \r\nover two hundred years, until Henry VII gave the name to his first-born son in \r\n1486. Henry was a Welshman and his motive, as a disputed claimant to the English \r\nthrone, was clearly to emphasize his links with the legendary King Arthur of the \r\nfifth or sixth century. At the same time, the choice seemed to fulfill the \r\npromise made to Cadwallader, the previous king of Britain, that his people \r\nshould once again possess the land of their fathers. Arthur was to be the prince \r\nwho united the red and white roses, putting an end to the long dynastic \r\nstruggle, but when he died in 1502 at the age of 16, his younger brother Henry \r\nbecame Prince of Wales and was made heir to the throne, which he inherited in \r\n1509. </p>\r\n<p>The inference has always been that Arthur Kaye was named in honor of this \r\nprince, an opinion that appears to be supported by early versions of his \r\npedigree. These comment on the Kayes&#8217; antiquity in Yorkshire and make the \r\nfabulous claim that the family descended from Sir Kay, King Arthur&#8217;s seneschal \r\nand one of the knights of the Round Table. <sup>7</sup>However, recent research \r\nthrows new light on this question of Arthur&#8217;s revival, confirming that gentry \r\nfamilies in the neighborhood of Woodsome had reintroduced the name some time \r\nbefore Henry VII used it. Indeed, an adult Arthur Wentworth was the tenant of \r\nland in south Yorkshire as early as 1468, suggesting that he had been named \r\naround 1450 at the latest. <sup>8</sup>It was the custom at that time for \r\nchildren to be named after a godparent, so when George Kaye&#8217;s son took the name, \r\nperhaps in 1502, he may have &#8220;inherited&#8221; it from one of the Wentworths, as part \r\nof the alliance between the two families. </p>\r\n<p>The direct male line of the Kayes became extinct in 1726 with the death of a \r\nlater Sir Arthur. Arthur was by then a traditional family name in the \r\nneighborhood, largely through the Kayes&#8217; patronage. And, if we are left to \r\nwonder why the Wentworths had revived the name in the mid-1400s, we need only \r\nconsider choices such as Troilus, Gawain, and Tristram made by other Yorkshire \r\ngentlemen in that period. No doubt their inspiration was the popular literature \r\nof the day and a desire to be associated with legendary heroes. </p>\r\n<br><sup>1. \r\n</sup>Carolyn Fenwick, <em>The Poll Taxes of 1377, 1379 and 1381, Pt. 1</em>, Oxford \r\nUniversity Press, 1998<br><sup>2.</sup> The Parish Registers of Almondbury, Vol \r\n2, 1598-1652, Yorkshire Archaeological Society<br><sup>3.</sup> Sir William \r\nDugdale, <em>Visitation of Yorkshire</em>, W.

Most of these unusual names \r\nhave meaningful distribution patterns, as has been shown recently by Schurer, \r\nRogers, Hey, and others. In most cases these significant patterns can be \r\nexplained by the surname&#8217;s origin, and its subsequent ramification and \r\ndistribution. These are key aspects of a surname&#8217;s history and can be used as \r\nvital tools in genealogical research. </p>\r\n<div id=\"center-column\"><div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p>It is still true in present-day England that a single-origin surname can be \r\nconcentrated in a relatively small area, close to where it originated up to 700 \r\nor more years ago. The same principle applies to names that have two or three \r\norigins, for they too are often found in good numbers close to the localities \r\nwhere they first stabilized. It is names in the latter category that concern me \r\nhere, for their distinctively local characteristics are less immediately obvious \r\nto researchers. I propose therefore to look in detail at Jessop, a classic \r\nexample of a surname believed to have had several origins. It is well \r\nestablished now in several parts of England and arrived in America as early as \r\nc.1637, when John Jessop or Jessup settled in Wethersfield, Massachusetts. </p>\r\n<p>The meaning of Jessop and its variants is not in doubt and most reference \r\nworks identify it as a form of the Hebrew personal name Joseph. We don&#8217;t know \r\nexactly how many origins the surname might have but at least we can infer that \r\neach group of Jessops had a progenitor called Joseph whose son inherited the \r\npersonal name as a surname. What is never commented on in such sources, though, \r\nis how unusual Joseph was as a first name choice in the 1300s, when surnames of \r\nthis type were stabilizing. A profile of its popularity over the centuries is \r\nimmediately revealing. </p>\r\n<p>If we begin with the statistics compiled by Scott Smith-Bannister in 1997, \r\nthe tables show that Joseph was not among the fifty most common English names \r\nwhen parish registers started in 1538, but that it had crept in at the bottom \r\nend by the 1560s and 1570s. From then on there was a slow but steady rise in its \r\npopularity and by the 1650s it was the tenth most frequent English name. It \r\nmaintained that position and improved on it, occupying eighth place in the \r\n1690s. Joseph remained a favorite through the eighteenth and nineteenth \r\ncenturies and it has never completely fallen out of use, although there have \r\nbeen fluctuations in its popularity, particularly in more recent times. Indeed \r\nit is so familiar to English speakers that it might be difficult for them to \r\nimagine a time when it was not in everyday use. </p>\r\n<p>And yet the truth is that Joseph, along with many other biblical names, was a \r\ndeliberate innovation in the mid-1500s, as Englishmen were exhorted to choose \r\nnames &#8220;whereof there are examples in the Holy Scriptures&#8221; (Cartwright). This \r\nchoice seems more likely to have been inspired by Joseph the patriarch, written \r\nabout in the book of Genesis, than by either Joseph of Arimathea or Joseph, the \r\nhusband of the Virgin Mary, for it was Old Testament names which found most \r\nfavor in England in the aftermath of the Reformation. In fact, references to \r\nJoseph before the 1500s are so rare that it is worth looking in closer detail at \r\nsome of the few early individuals who bore the name. </p>\r\n<p>The recently published English Poll Tax returns of 1377-81 contain scarcely \r\nany examples of Joseph as a personal name but there is one small cluster in the \r\nLiberties of the Cinque Ports in Kent&#8212;originally Romney, Hastings, Hythe, Dover, \r\nand Sandwich. In one section of the return the names Josep Elys, Josep Younge, \r\nand Josep Palmer are recorded<strong>&#8212;</strong>three individuals who were obviously close \r\nneighbors and possibly spiritual kin. In the same section we also find John \r\nJosep and Thomas Josep, men who seem certain to have taken their surname from \r\none or other of the three Josephs.</p>\r\n<p>It was suggested by Withycombe that the Italian <em>Giuseppe </em>might have \r\ninfluenced this spelling of the name, as many of the men called Joseph in \r\nmedieval records were Italian Jews. Whether or not that is the case, the \r\nspelling &#8220;Josep&#8221; was found in different parts of England and there is no \r\nevidence that any of those who bore the name were Jews. For example, William \r\nJosep was living in Sussex in the 1290s and Richard Josepp was taxed on the Isle \r\nof Wight in 1379, neither of them in places with known Jewish communities. In \r\npassing it is worth noting that Richard&#8217;s servant was called Thomas Josep, \r\ninviting speculation about the relationship between the two men and the exact \r\nnature of the surname&#8217;s origin. </p>\r\n<p>The vowel change from &#8220;Josep&#8221; to &#8220;Jesop&#8221; occurred early in the surname&#8217;s \r\nhistory, as evidence from Yorkshire much further to the north makes clear. In \r\n1375 William, the son of Baldwin Josep, granted lands in the West Riding \r\ntownship of Cumberworth to his brother John, and four years later their names \r\nwere entered in the Cumberworth tax roll as William Josop and John Jesop, both \r\npaying four pence. In the family&#8217;s title deeds these two spellings alternated \r\nthroughout the 1400s, until Jessop became the conventional local form by c.1500. \r\nIt eventually ramified in that part of the county, with Jessup as a rare \r\nvariation. </p>\r\n<p>The extraordinary part of this surname&#8217;s history is that Kent and Yorkshire \r\nwere for centuries at the heart of its distribution, and Guppy identified Kent \r\nas the major &#8220;home&#8221; of the surname only a century ago. He found other Jessops \r\njust across the Thames estuary in Essex, but these may be connected with a \r\nfamily recorded in a Suffolk subsidy roll in 1524 (Reaney). David Hey included \r\nJessop in his survey of Sheffield surnames, finding that 1,778 subscribers were \r\nlisted in the 1986 U.K. telephone directories, with 32% residing in Yorkshire \r\nand 21% in East Anglia (i.e. Essex and Suffolk). However it seems from his \r\naccount of the name that the numbers in south Yorkshire may have been augmented \r\nby &#8220;immigrants&#8221; from Nottinghamshire, an immediate neighbor to the south of the \r\ncounty. </p>\r\n<p>This is therefore precisely the type of English surname that could benefit \r\nfrom a DNA analysis. The Y-chromosomes of males called Jessop and Jessup would \r\nsurely provide us with a much more accurate idea of how many distinct families \r\nnow have the surname. The probability is that some of the very early by-names \r\nsoon became extinct and that we are searching for no more than three or four \r\nprogenitors called Joseph. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Sources<br><br></strong>Hey, D.

Written from Bristol, the letter referred to some able men of [Ashley&#8217;s] own kindred who were willing to invest financially in his New England venture, so he may have had Bristol connections. At Isaac Allerton&#8217;s instigation, two of the colony&#8217;s English investors, James Sherley and Timothy Hatherly, chose Ashley to manage a new trading post at Penobscot, Maine.

In William Bradford&#8217;s words, &#8220;He had for some time lived among the Indians as a savage and went naked amongst them and used their manners, in which time he got their language.&#8221; He may have had contact with the Plymouth colonists at that time. After 16 months, he returned to England for five months. He sailed from Bristol in March, 1629/30, aboard the&#160;<em>Lyon</em>, in company with Isaac Allerton, arriving in New England in May. Plymouth officials reluctantly supplied him with trade goods. Mistrusting him the officials also sent another new arrival,Thomas Willet, with him as a partner. Ashley continued working at Penobscot until October 1631.At that time he was found trading guns, powder and ammunition to the Natives in direct violation of both his agreement with Plymouth and the King&#8217;s proclamation. He was arrested and returned to England.After a short stay in the Fleet prison,Ashley was released after February 17, 1631/2, but warned never to trade weapons, etc. again. Instead of returning to New England as planned, he was sent by some merchants to Russia, mostly likely for the fur trade.

Radford", "country": "Ireland", "title": "Catholic Records and their Use in Irish Research", "content": "<p>I think that we often fail to appreciate Catholic registers in genealogical \r\nresearch. It&#8217;s so easy to be in a hurry to find what you want that the really \r\ngood things are missed altogether. I want to share some of the strategies and \r\nlogic that I have used over the years.<br><br><strong>Types of \r\nRecords</strong><br>Catholic records, whether in Ireland or in the immigrant country, \r\nusually consist of baptisms and marriages. Burial is not a sacrament in the \r\nCatholic church so a parish did not have to keep burial registers. I believe one \r\nof the most important pieces of information that can be derived from a baptism \r\nor marriage record is the names of the godparents at a christening and witnesses \r\nat a marriage. In theory they are people the family know and trust so they may \r\nbe family members or friends from Ireland. For immigration purposes if you can&#8217;t \r\nfind out where in Ireland your ancestor was from, research the lives of the \r\ngodparents or witnesses.<br><br>Often marriage registers will list parents&#8217; \r\nnames and place of birth. If a priest recorded this information, it may solve a \r\nvery difficult immigration problem. Burials, when kept, are also a source of \r\nimmigrant origins. If the records give county of birth in Ireland, make sure to \r\nlook at all entries (not just your surname) to see if a high percentage of them \r\nare coming from a particular county.<br><br>If you&#8217;re using Irish records, the \r\ngodparents and witnesses names found can be utilized as an immigrant resource. \r\nBy this I mean that if you think you have found your ancestor in an Irish church \r\nrecord, now you have to prove it. You can take the godparents and witnesses&#8217; \r\nnames from the register to see if this cluster of families settled where your \r\nancestor did. This may be the only way to determine if that person in the Irish \r\nrecord is really your ancestor. Often, I will write to a heritage centre in \r\nIreland and they will apologize for finding five people in the county with the \r\nsame name and they don&#8217;t know which is the correct entry. To me this is a \r\nblessing as I can now take the godparents names from these five christenings and \r\ncontinue with my immigrant research. I then write back to the heritage centre to \r\nrequest that they send me the siblings&#8217; names and godparents&#8217; names for those \r\nfive families.<br><br>Another type of record that is often overlooked are \r\ndispensations. When a couple wanted to be married by a Catholic priest, but a \r\nquestion arose, it goes before the bishop of the diocese for his consideration. \r\nThe resulting record can be really good as it will frequently give parents&#8217; \r\nnames and birth places for the couple. Dispensations are usually kept at the \r\ndiocese. However, there should be a notation in the local parish register that a \r\ndispensation was granted. Dispensations were granted for any number of reasons. \r\nA few reasons are as follows: </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>A Catholic marrying an unbaptized person. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>The couple were related to one another. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>One or both of the couple were minors. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>If it can be proven that the marriage will insure that the children will be \r\nraised Catholic. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>A couple&#8217;s relationship was already known as notorious or that it will \r\nbecome so. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>The scandal or loss of reputation due to pregnancy or to prevent conduct \r\nshort of intercourse which can be prevented only by marriage. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>That the marriage provides for the welfare of the child and also of the \r\nmother lest she remain unwed. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>The most common reason for a dispensation would probably be something as \r\nsimple as the banns were not read the proper amount of times in church. \r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>What If Your Ancestors Aren&#8217;t Found</strong><br>What if you don&#8217;t find your \r\nancestor listed in a church register? The problem can range from only part of a \r\ncouple&#8217;s children being listed in the christening records to none of them being \r\nlisted. If you already know where your ancestors lived, then I would suggest the \r\nfollowing course: </p>\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>Maybe your ancestors had their family events recorded in a neighboring \r\nparish. This will especially be true if your ancestral parish was originally a \r\nmission of another parish. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>On the frontier of America and Canada prior to the arrival of priests \r\nfamilies may have been baptized and married by a Protestant minister or married \r\nby a civil official. This is more common than some would like to believe. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>When you&#8217;re looking in Irish records for an ancestor, it&#8217;s important to \r\nremember that in many parts of rural Ireland the people did not &#8220;go to church&#8221; \r\nin the sense that they do today. The priest went out into the townlands where he \r\nheld Mass, married couples and baptized children. The priests did not take the \r\nregisters with them into the townlands. They wrote the information down (in \r\ntheory) and added to the parish register periodically (again in theory). This \r\ndid not always happen. The Heritage Centre in County Clare estimates that some \r\n30% of the population who should be in the registers are not. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Often the Catholic records in Ireland or in North America simply do not \r\nstart early enough. Again, it may be that a traveling priest took his notes back \r\nto the main church or cathedral he was serving from. Then again, sometimes we&#8217;ll \r\nnever know. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>I have found when a Catholic marries a non-Catholic, the marriage usually \r\noccurred in a non-Catholic church while the children were baptized and raised \r\nCatholic. Also, this may be the first clue in family research that one of the \r\nspouses was not from a Catholic family. It is common to see throughout church \r\nrecords where a spouse converts to Catholicism. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>When You&#8217;re Desperate</strong><br>I have been known to go through the same \r\nCatholic record two or three times. Although this may sound extreme it really \r\nisn&#8217;t. If one strategy fails, that&#8217;s okay, go on to the next one. My desperation \r\nstrategy is to take a particular time fame and conduct the following in-depth \r\nanalysis: </p>\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>Look for all persons in the records for a 10 or 15 year time frame with the \r\nsame surname as your ancestors (maiden name of the wife included). Chart these \r\nindividuals in date order in the christening and marriage registers (if burials \r\nexist, use them also). Then ask yourself if these people are relatives from \r\nIreland. If you find that they have some of the same witnesses and godparents \r\ninvolved with their lives as your ancestors did, then I would guess they were \r\nsiblings or cousins from Ireland. Trace out their lives to see where they are \r\nfrom in Ireland. This, of course, is helpful if you&#8217;re seeking immigrant \r\norigins. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Take a given span of years and not look for the surname of those being \r\nchristened or married, but look strictly for the godparents and witnesses. This \r\nway you can extract those familiar family surnames and see with whom they were \r\ninvolved. Again the big question is whether they are friends, in-laws, or \r\ncousins from Ireland. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Catholic records in Ireland do start late. I will note one last strategy to \r\nbridge the gap created by records which do not often start until the late 1820s \r\nor early 1830s. Take note of who acted as the godparents to your ancestor&#8217;s \r\nchildren, and if they have the same last name, you have probably stumbled upon \r\ntheir siblings or cousins. Godparents at a christening are usually the same \r\ngeneration as the couple having the children. The identity of witnesses at a \r\nwedding can be more tricky; not only can they be siblings or cousins but also \r\nparents to the groom or bride. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong><br>Catholic records can be one of the most useful sources \r\nin your research. Just make sure that you keep an open mind about them even if \r\nyou don&#8217;t necessarily find what you&#8217;re looking for outright. Remember many \r\nparishes in the US and Canada were made up of years and years of immigration \r\nfrom the same area of Ireland - thus the local parish will have a high \r\npercentage of persons from the same county in Ireland. There are so many \r\npossibilities when researching in Catholic records that your imagination is \r\ntruly the limit on what you can learn from them.<br><br>Dwight Radford<br><br>I \r\nwish to thank my friend, James R.

Daly ", "country": "Ireland", "title": "Getting Started: Irish American Genealogical Research", "content": "<p>Irish American genealogists need to determine their ancestor's exact \r\norigin in Ireland before they can begin researching Irish records. The \r\nrecords that provide this information are generally located in New World\r\n records such as naturalizations, tombstone inscriptions, banking and \r\ninsurance records, missing friends advertisements or obituaries. \r\nGenealogists can increase their chances of successfully finding records \r\nwith exact origin by employing strategies that avoid false assumptions, \r\ntie together disparate records, and widen the focus of research to \r\ninclude siblings, other relatives, and friends.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Avoid making \r\nassumptions about your ancestor.</em></p>\r\n<p>Many people say that they have researched all the available records \r\nfor their ancestor but cannot find any mention of their exact place of \r\norigin in Ireland. Their search did not go beyond census and civil \r\nregistration records. They have assumed that their ancestor was too poor\r\n to generate probate records or deeds or to have had a tombstone; that \r\ntheir ancestor never bothered naturalizing; or that their ancestor \r\nprobably did not fight in the Civil War, so they have not bothered \r\nsearching for these records. Starting out with low expectations for your\r\n ancestor will guarantee failure. </p>\r\n<p>To ensure success, do not make assumptions about your ancestors. \r\nUntil you have eliminated each of these sources by actually looking for \r\nthem, you cannot say your ancestor did not generate any records. In \r\nfact, even the poorest people can be found in the records of almshouses,\r\n orphanages, settlement houses, state hospitals, mental institutions, \r\nprisons, courts, newspapers, churches, schools, undertakers' and police \r\nlogs. Even though your ancestor may have been a common laborer or \r\nservant, he or she probably can be found in a number of standard \r\nsources. Search federal and state censuses, civil registrations, \r\nnaturalizations, burial records, military rolls, church baptisms and \r\nmarriages, passenger arrival lists, probate court records and deeds, and\r\n street directories. </p>\r\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Use sources that link \r\nto other records</em></p>\r\n<p>Two good sources for beginners are the 1920 and 1900 federal \r\ncensuses. These are indexed by soundex, which makes it fairly easy to \r\nlocate Irish immigrants in big cities. The census records for these \r\nyears provide the year of immigration, the citizenship status \r\n(naturalized, alien, or pending), the year of naturalization, how many \r\nyears in the U.S., and how many years married. From these records you \r\ncan estimate the time frame for searching naturalization records and \r\npassenger arrival lists. You can also determine whether or not your \r\nancestor was married in the U.S. or in Ireland. If the number of years \r\nmarried exceeds the number of years in the U.S., then the marriage took \r\nplace in Ireland. If they number of years married is less than the \r\nnumber of years in the U.S., then you can search for a marriage record \r\nin the U.S. The birthplaces and ages of a couple's children will help \r\nyou determine the year of immigration. If a twenty-year-old child was \r\nborn in Ireland, and an eighteen-year-old child was born in the U.S., \r\nthen the year of immigration took place eighteen to twenty years before \r\nthe census year. The 1870 census indicates whether the person is an \r\neligible voter (look for naturalizations), and the 1860 census lists the\r\n value of personal and real estate (look for probate records and deeds).</p>\r\n<p>Marriage records are some of the most reliable sources and can help \r\npinpoint an ancestor in a big city. Consider the source of the \r\ninformation. The information on death certificates comes from distraught\r\n family and friends, undertakers and physicians, and can be inaccurate. \r\n\"Our dear, departed uncle John said he sailed from Derry, so that must \r\nbe where he was born.\" (Uncle John is no longer around to correctly \r\nstate he was from Buncrana, Donegal, fifteen miles northwest of Derry.) \r\nBut the information for the marriage record is from the bride and groom,\r\n who state the names of their parents and their birthplaces. In \r\naddition, the marriage record often indicates the priest or minister as \r\nthe source. You can then determine through street directories and church\r\n directories the location of the priest or minister in the year of your \r\nancestor's marriage. This will help you pinpoint the ward and street \r\nyour ancestor (or the bride's parents) lived on, and differentiate your \r\nPatrick O'Brien from the fifteen others in the street directory.</p>\r\n<p>Death certificates, undertaker records, and obituaries may provide \r\nthe place of burial, so you can look for the tombstone. In some states, \r\nthe state death record does not provide the burial place, but the city \r\nrecord does. In this instance, the city death certificate would be a \r\nbetter choice. You can also determine the name of the undertaker from \r\nthe death certificate and the obituary. Undertaker records may also \r\nprovide the burial place and other details. Some undertaker records even\r\n list the birthplace in Ireland.</p>\r\n<p>While federal census records were collected every ten years, many \r\nstreet directories, especially for large cities, were printed every \r\nyear. Street directories can help you track the movement of your \r\nancestor from one address to another over the years, ascertain the ward \r\nnumber necessary for using the federal censuses, and find in which \r\nparish your ancestor lived. Street directories can also help you \r\ndetermine the date of death. If you are uncertain about the date of \r\ndeath, find your ancestor in a street directory, look ahead ten years to\r\n see if your ancestor is still listed. If he is listed, look ahead \r\nanother ten years, until you cannot find him. Then look back five years,\r\n and ahead or back two years, until you have found the year in which \r\nyour ancestor disappears from street directories. Several factors can \r\ncause this disappearance: your ancestor could have moved to another \r\ntown, gone to California, moved in with his daughter, or died. At least \r\nyou have a time period in which to search the death records. \r\nFurthermore, many early-twentieth-century street directories give the \r\nactual date of death of your deceased ancestor.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Associate your ancestor\r\n with as many people as possible</em></p>\r\n<p>The most common mistake researchers make is focusing only on their \r\ndirect ancestor. Even if you research all the records that mention your \r\nancestor, you may not find the exact birthplace in Ireland. You can \r\nincrease your chances of success if you increase the number of people \r\nyou are looking for. When you visit the <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.nara.gov/\">National Archives</a>, or the county superior court, bring\r\n a list of several people associated with your ancestor in addition to \r\nyour direct forebear. Irish men and women did not generally emigrate by \r\nthemselves and live alone once they arrived in the New World. They often\r\n traveled with their peers or siblings from the same village or parish. \r\nOnce they arrived at the docks of New York, Boston, or Philadelphia, \r\nthey were ushered into Irish American communities, often consisting of \r\npeople from their former villages or counties. They formed their own \r\ncongregations; many were led by clergy from home. Every town had its \r\nKerry Corner or Cork Hill. Friends and relatives often appear in records\r\n as godparents for baptisms, witnesses for marriages, or witnesses on \r\nwills, deeds, and naturalization records. They are the adjacent families\r\n in the census records, the beneficiaries of insurance policies, or the \r\nnext of kin in probate records. Make note of the other people with the \r\nsame last name in the town directory. When going through your family \r\npapers, make note of whose Mass cards are in your grandmother's prayer \r\nbook, who donated gifts to your mother's bridal shower, or whose \r\nphotographs are displayed in the family album. Once you have assembled a\r\n list of people associated with your ancestor, research their origins in\r\n addition to your own. </p>\r\n<p>Researching Irish women can be difficult because, until 1920 women, \r\nwith few exceptions, did not naturalize. And they are less likely to \r\nappear in many records, such as deeds or military records. Nevertheless,\r\n the same strategy can apply to women, i.e., associating your female \r\nancestor with as many males as possible. Instead of looking for your \r\ngreat grandmother's naturalization, look for her brothers' or cousins' \r\nrecords. </p>\r\n<p>This list of strategies implies that the genealogist will actually \r\nturn off their computer and go to the local or state archives to access \r\nthese records. Although many records are becoming available over the \r\nInternet, most of these sources can only be accessed by visiting an \r\narchive, courthouse, church, or library. The Internet is extremely \r\nuseful for bringing researchers together to share information about \r\ntheir common ancestors. But you should always refer to the sources used \r\nand double check the information whenever possible. By maintaining a \r\nwide focus when researching Irish ancestors and chasing down every clue,\r\n no matter how unlikely, researchers can improve their chances of \r\nsuccessfully determining the exact origin of their immigrant ancestor.</p>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/irish-american-genealogical-research/", "published": "", "id": 205}, {"author": "Marie E. Daly ", "country": "Ireland", "title": "Identifying the Origin of Your Irish Immigrant Ancestor", "content": "<p>Finding the exact origin of your ancestor, i.e. parish or townland, is key to \r\ncontinuing your research in Irish records. But Irish surnames and given names \r\nare very common. In fact, in 1890 the four most common surnames were Murphy, \r\nKelly, O'Sullivan and Walsh. See <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.ireland-information.com/\"><em>Ireland-information.com</em></a> for a list of the 100 most \r\ncommon surnames. You cannot just look at a surname map of Ireland and determine \r\nthat your ancestor came from a particular place. Information on exact birthplace \r\nin Ireland is to be found mainly in New World records. </p>\r\n<p>A large percentage of Irish Americans have ancestors who immigrated in the \r\nearly and mid-nineteenth century, a period when records were kept in less detail \r\nthan their twentieth-century counterparts. The Irish tended to live, but not \r\nexclusively, in large cities and were highly mobile. The Irish worked wherever \r\nthey could obtain employment, often building railroads, digging canals, plying \r\nsteamships and canal boats, working on the waterfront docks and in factories. \r\nMany of the most readily accessible records, such as census records, civil \r\nregistrations, and church sacramental documents merely record <em>Ireland</em> as \r\nthe place of birth. In their quest for exact birthplace in Ireland, researchers \r\nwill have greater (but not guaranteed) success with the following records. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Immigration and Naturalization Records</strong><br>Naturalization petitions and \r\ndeclarations of intent are the most common and easily accessed records that \r\nprovide exact birthplace. Beginning in 1790, citizenship required a residency \r\nperiod in the Unites States and the residency period varied over the decades. \r\nPrior to 1906, aliens could apply for citizenship in many types of courts, from \r\ncourts of common pleas, local police and municipal courts, to (more commonly) \r\ncounty courts, and federal district and circuit courts. In 1906 the Bureau of \r\nImmigration and Naturalization was established, and naturalizations occurred in \r\nfederal courts thereafter. In most cases, there were three records created for \r\neach naturalized citizen. An immigrant would make a <em>declaration of intent</em> \r\nafter a specified length of residency, and then several years later \r\n<em>petition</em> for citizenship. He was given a <em>record of his \r\nnaturalization,</em> which he could take home. This last record was the least \r\ninformative. Both the declarations of intent and the naturalization petitions \r\nare court records. Sometimes, the petitions are mixed in with all the other \r\ncourt records. When you use a court index, look for single names, which are \r\npetitions, and exclude double names, such as <em>Murphy</em> versus \r\n<em>O'Brien,</em> which are torts. </p>\r\n<p>The 1900 and 1920 censuses are good records for finding the immigrant's \r\ncitizenship status, year of immigration, or year of naturalization. These are \r\narranged by soundex and are available in regional branches of the National \r\nArchives. </p>\r\n<p>Whether the exact birthplace was recorded on the declaration of intent or on \r\nthe petition varied by state, court, judge or clerk, and even by individual. The \r\nfederal court records were better for some states than others, and in some \r\nstates the local records are better than the federal records. So the genealogist \r\nmust be prepared for failure when researching naturalizations. One way to offset \r\nthe paucity of detailed records is to focus not only on your direct ancestor, \r\nbut also collateral lines--in-laws, friends, neighbors, godparents at baptisms, \r\nand witnesses at marriages. When you go to the National Archives or the county \r\ncourthouse, have a list of your ancestor's associates to research also. </p>\r\n<p>For detailed information about the availability and location of \r\nnaturalization records, readers are directed to the <em>Guide to Naturalization \r\nRecords of the United States</em> by Christina K, Schaefer (Baltimore: GPC, \r\n1997), <em>American Naturalization Records, 1790-1990: What They Are and How to \r\nUse Them</em>, by John J. Newman (Heritage Quest, 1998) and <em>They Became \r\nAmericans: Finding Naturalization Records and Ethnic Origins</em>, by Loretto \r\nDennis Szucs (Salt Lake City: Ancestry, 1998). In the New England states, except \r\nfor Connecticut, the WPA copied onto dexographs the naturalizations of all court \r\nrecords, and indexed them by soundex. The information recorded often includes \r\nname, residence, occupation, age, date of birth, place of birth, date, port of \r\narrival, and the court where the original declaration of intent was made. \r\nUnfortunately, Connecticut records usually give only country of birth. The WPA \r\ncopies and indexes and federal court records for all New England states are \r\navailable at the New England regional branch of the National Archives. For a \r\ncomplete list of National Archives regional branches, please consult <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.nara.gov/\">NARA</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Passenger Arrival and Departure Lists</strong><br>Many genealogists consider \r\nnineteenth-century passenger arrival lists their Holy Grail. For most of the \r\nnineteenth century, the only thing you are going to find is your ancestor's name \r\nand age. Exact birthplaces are rarely recorded. The port of departure in Ireland \r\ngives little clue either, since immigrants would walk hundreds of miles, or take \r\ncanal boats and river ferries to reach the port. Also, many Irish emigrants went \r\nto ports in Great Britain, such as Liverpool and Glasgow, before immigrating to \r\nthe New World. </p>\r\n<p>Beginning in the 1890s, and most consistently after 1906, the passenger \r\narrival lists give much better detail. The post-1906 lists provide the name and \r\naddress of kin back in the old country as well as the name and address of \r\nsponsors in the New World. They also provide a physical description of the \r\npassenger, including hair and eye color (for identifying bodies in case of \r\nshipwreck). You can find the date and port of arrival on the naturalization \r\nrecord, but remember that the immigrant was stating this five to seven years \r\nlater, and his memory was not always reliable. In addition, immigrants were \r\nknown to falsify their arrival date in order to speed up the naturalization \r\nprocess and to acquire voting rights in highly contested elections. One clue \r\nthat the dates of birth or arrival may be conjecture is the appearance of March \r\n17 and July 12. If these dates are provided, the genealogist can assume that the \r\nimmigrant may not be clear about his birth date or date of arrival. In a peasant \r\nsociety, the chronological date of March 5, 1839 may be better known as the \r\nSecond Sunday in Lent or St. Ciaran's Day in the Year of the Big Wind, and under \r\npressure by a bureaucrat, the immigrant will state March 17. </p>\r\n<p>Passenger arrival lists for most ports in the United States are available on \r\nmicrofilm at the regional branches of the National Archives. Many of the NARA \r\nlists of smaller ports have been produced on CD, but they are not searchable by \r\nname. In addition, a number of searchable passenger arrival lists for certain \r\nports in certain periods have been published CD format. These include \r\n<em>Passenger and Immigration Lists: Irish Immigrants to North America, \r\n1803-1871</em>, (Broderbund, 1999), <em>Passenger and Immigration Lists: Irish \r\nto America, 1846-1865</em>, (Broderbund, 1999), <em>Passenger and Immigration \r\nLists: Boston, 1821-1850</em>, (Broderbund, 1998), <em>Passenger and Immigration \r\nLists, New York, 1820-1850 </em>, (Broderbund, 1999), and <em>Passenger and \r\nImmigration Lists 1538-2000 </em>, (Broderbund, 2000), which is also available in \r\nbook format. </p>\r\n<p>Some passenger departure and emigration lists are available for Irish ports \r\nand counties for certain years. One Derry shipping line, Cooke and McCorkell, \r\nplied trade routes from Philadelphia and St. John, New Brunswick, and brought \r\nback passengers from the northwestern counties in Ireland to these New World \r\nports. Covering the years 1847-1871, the lists give the parish and county of \r\norigin. The lists were compiled, indexed, and published by Brian Mitchell, \r\n<em>Irish Passenger Lists, 1847-1871</em> (Baltimore: GPC, 1988). Also, when the \r\ninformation for the Ordnance Survey of Ireland was gathered, the names of \r\nemigrants were listed for parishes in Counties Derry and Antrim. These lists \r\nhave been published in the book, <em>Irish Emigration Lists, 1833-1839,</em> by \r\nBrian C. Mitchell (GPC, 1989). <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.tiara.ie/\">TIARA</a>&#160;links to many online emigration and passenger lists. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Tombstone Inscriptions</strong><br>Many nineteenth-century Irish American \r\ntombstones have inscribed the deceased's birthplace in Ireland. The places often \r\ninclude the townland or parish of origin. These records can be very useful to \r\nthe genealogist, but tombstone inscriptions are less centralized or accessible \r\nthan other records, unless the graveyard has been transcribed. Genealogists \r\nencounter several problems in their search for tombstones, including (1) finding \r\nthe cemetery, and (2) finding the grave within the cemetery. </p>\r\n<p>In large American cities, Catholics were buried in diocesan cemeteries \r\nlocated in the nearby suburbs. They did not have the small white churches of \r\npuritan New England with the little graveyard attached. Death records often \r\nprovide burial place, but this detail is sometimes omitted in state death \r\nrecords. Genealogists are better off consulting local town or city vital \r\nrecords. Newspaper obituaries and undertaker records are other sources for \r\nburial place, although many Irish Americans of the Famine period did not have \r\nobituaries, and undertaker records may have disappeared by the twentieth \r\ncentury. </p>\r\n<p>Even if you have determined in which cemetery your ancestor has been buried, \r\nfinding a gravestone presents another hurdle. The first place to look is the \r\ncemetery office that maintains the burial records. The records may have been \r\ncentralized into a regional cemetery office, so a few phone calls may be \r\nnecessary to locate the records. The lucky genealogist will find a burial record \r\nwith a list of others buried in the lot. Write down the grave number and section \r\nor row number, and ask to see a map of the cemetery, if one exists. If burial \r\nrecords are unavailable, you will have to search the cemetery. Most burial lots \r\nwere sold in consecutive order by row or section, so that all the lot sales for \r\na particular year will be in the same section. But just because your ancestor \r\ndied in 1885, does not mean the grave was purchased in that year. With the high \r\ninfant mortality rate, couples frequently purchased family lots to bury their \r\nyoung children. </p>\r\n<p>Check for published tombstone inscriptions. Irish Americans are just \r\nbeginning the process of transcribing Catholic graveyards, and there are only a \r\nfew sources at this time. Readers are urged to go out into their local Catholic \r\ngraveyards and write down and photograph the tombstones before they are \r\ndestroyed by pollution and vandalism. Some Internet sites publish tombstones \r\ninscriptions. Although few Catholic cemeteries have been transcribed and \r\npublished on the Internet, readers can publish their own data on the following \r\nsites: USGenWeb Tombstone Project and the Virtual Cemetery at <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.genealogy.com/\">Genealogy.com </a>. One published \r\nprint source is <em>Tombstones of the Irish Born: Cemetery of the Holy Cross, \r\nFlatbush, Brooklyn</em> by Joseph Silinonte, available through the Circulating \r\nLibrary, as is my <em>Gravestone Inscriptions of Mount Auburn Catholic Cemetery, \r\nWatertown, Mass.</em>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newspaper Records</strong><br>Although few Irish Americans could afford to pay for a detailed obituary in a big city newspaper, there were some regular columns for connecting long lost relatives and friends (Missing Friends ads). These occurred in the nationally distributed newspapers, the Boston Pilot and the New York Herald. They have been indexed, and in the case of the Boston Pilot, published in an eight volume series, The Search for Missing Friends (Boston: NEHGS, 1988-1999) (on Vol. 3;Vol. 4;Vol. 5;Vol. 6;Vol. 7). The ads frequently provide the parish, if not townland of origin, as well as other family information. <br><br><strong>Business Records</strong><br>Two great largely untapped resources are banking and insurance records. Immigrants tended to use certain banks that catered to the immigrant population. Banks such as the Emigrant Savings Bank of New York (1850-1880) and the Boston Five Cent Savings Bank kept detailed records on people who opened accounts. Some of the banking records have been preserved by academic institutions. GenExchange.com has a search engine for looking up entries from the Emigrant Savings Bank of New York records. Also, a fraternal organization by Irish-American Catholics to provide insurance, the Catholic Order of Foresters, kept detailed records of claims, which included information from death records. Researchers in American cities should look through local public and academic archives, and also the banking and insurance companies themselves, to see if early records have been preserved. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Other Records</strong><br>Many archivists will tell the public that you cannot \r\nfind the exact origin of an immigrant in the census records, vital records, \r\nchurch baptisms and marriages, probate records, military records or deeds. \r\nGenerally this is true, but enough exceptions occur to make all of these sources \r\nworth checking. For instance, one census taker recorded the county of origin for \r\nthe Irish immigrant ward of the North End of Boston in 1860. Many census takers \r\nfor the Massachusetts state census for 1865 recorded the county of origin. The \r\nUnion Army pension records in Washington D.C. may not provide exact birthplace, \r\nbut the Massachusetts National Guard mustering-in rolls do. </p>\r\n<p>Some Irish American genealogists omit a very important initial step in their \r\nsearch for ancestors: their own family records. There is a misconception that \r\nCatholics did not keep family bibles, so people do not look for them. This \r\nsearch may require writing or phoning distant cousins, visiting elderly aunts or \r\ndragging out those musty boxes in the attic. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>Finding the exact origin of your Irish immigrant \r\nancestor requires the analytical skills of Sherlock Holmes and the persistence \r\nof Columbo. But you also have a third attribute, which will carry you a long way \r\nin your quest -- the luck of the Irish. </p>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/identifying-origin-your-irish-immigrant-ancestor/", "published": "May 22, 2000", "id": 206}, {"author": "Marie E.

Welch, 1859-1881", "content": "<p><strong>Ann Mulheran</strong></p>\r\n<p>The author of many of the letters, Ann Mulheerin [sic], was baptized on 5 July 1840 in the parish of Kilronan, County Roscommon, and was the daughter of Patrick Mulheerin and Mary Flynn. The sponsors at her baptism were Peter Flynn and Ann Monaghan.<sup>1</sup> In her letters, Ann mentions a sister, Eliza. Elizabeth Mulheerin was baptized on 22 November 1841 in the parish of Kilronan, and was the daughter of Patrick Mulheerin and Mary Flynn. Sponsors at her baptism were Stephen McKenna and Bridget Mulheerin.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<p>Ann wrote most of the letters from 1860 through 1863 from the townland of Seltannaveeny, which is located on the northern border of Kilronan parish, near the Sligo border. The townland is situated within a region in Kilronan called Arigna. Mining has been a major industry in these mountains above Lough Allen since the 1600s, first as iron mines and later coal mines.<sup>3</sup> Situated on the side of Corrie or Lynch&#8217;s Mountain, the townland of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newenglandancestors.org/8168.htm\">Seltannaveeny</a> had a long, narrow shape, with the population centered in the lower, southern half, and with mountain bog and about ten coal-pits in the upper, northern half. The Arigna River runs at the base of the mountain through the Arigna Valley.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<p>Mulherns have lived in the townland of Seltannaveeny for generations. In the 1825 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newenglandancestors.org/8169.htm\">tithe applotment book</a>, there were three Mulheern [sic] heads-of-household: Andrew, Bryan and Michael Mulheern.<sup>5</sup> With the data gathered around 1850, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newenglandancestors.org/8170.htm\">Griffith&#8217;s Valuation</a> lists three Mulherans: Francis, Mary and Andrew. Since we know that Ann Mulhern&#8217;s mother was named Mary, it is possible that the Mary listed in Griffith&#8217;s Valuation is her mother. In the valuation, Mary Mulheran lives at #4a, and rents from Edward K. Tenison 7+ acres of land and a house valued at 5 shillings. This would have been a one-room house. She may have lived in a larger house earlier in her life, and may have turned over her larger house to one of her sons. The houses of Francis and Andrew Mulheran were valued at 15 shillings, which were probably three-room, thatch-roofed cottages. From the letters, we know that Ann&#8217;s mother, Mary Mulheran, lived alone. From Griffith&#8217;s Valuation, we also note that Thomas Flynn lived next door, and may have been her brother. The twelve families who lived in Seltannaveeny shared in common 141+ acres of mountain land.<sup>6</sup></p>\r\n<p>Their landlord was Edward King Tenison, who lived in Kilronan Castle, held over 17,000 acres of land in Roscommon, and was the High Sheriff of Leitrim. The rental rolls of Edward K. Tenison 1846 &#8211; 1859 [MSS.3156] and 57 valuation maps of his estates [MSS. 19,747] are available at the National Archives of Ireland.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Thomas J. Walsh/Welch</strong><br>Ann Mulheran addressed the letters to Thomas J. Walsh, Esq., 48 Oak Street, Boston, and the letters imply that Ann had worked as a domestic servant for the Walsh family [the family was usually recorded as Welch in records]. She likened &#8220;Aunt Chloe&#8217;s preparation in the cabin&#8221; in the book, <em>Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin</em>, to Mrs. Walsh&#8217;s directions to Ann. </p>\r\n<p>According to his marriage and death certificates, Thomas J. Welch was born in Pennington, NJ ca 1825, and was the son of John and Elizabeth Welch. The parents of Thomas may have been the John Welsh and Eliza Hunt who were married in Hunterdon County, New Jersey on 11 June 1812.<sup>8</sup> The Welch family came to Boston as early as 1829, and his father was a grocer on Washington Street, in business with John Wade, who lived next door in 1850.<sup>9</sup> John Welch engaged in numerous real estate transactions, as did his sons, Wilson Welch and Thomas J. Welch.<sup>10</sup> In the early 1850s before his marriage, Thomas boarded with his brother, Harrison S. Welch, at the same address at 737 Washington Street.<sup>11</sup> His brother had taken over the grocery business. Thomas J. Welch also engaged in many land transactions, and in 1860, his real estate was valued at $28,000,<sup>12</sup> and in 1870 at $10,000.<sup>13</sup></p>\r\n<p>Thomas J. Welch married Mary E. [Eliza] Ainsworth, daughter of Almond Ainsworth, on 25 June 1853 in Boston.<sup>14</sup>&#160; Eliza Ainsworth had been born in Boston on 4 July1829, and her father was Almond Ainsworth. According to her death record, her mother, Mary Stacy, had been born in Eliot, Maine.<sup>15</sup> However, the Ainsworth genealogy states that she was the daughter of Almon Ainsworth and Roxanna Drake, and that her mother was born in Canton, Massachusetts. Her father had been a merchant in Boston, and at some time moved to Guelph, Ontario, where he died on 15 February 1884.<sup>16</sup> Thomas J. Welch died of Organic Disease of Brain in the Insane Asylum, Somerville, Massachusetts on 29 December 1872. The asylum was most likely the McLean Psychiatric Hospital.<sup>17</sup> Mary E. (Ainsworth) Welch died in Brookline, MA on 4 December 1913.<sup>18</sup></p>\r\n<p>Thomas J. and Mary Elizabeth (Ainsworth) Welch had the following children:</p>\r\n<ol type=\"i\">\r\n<li>Elizabeth E., born 24 November 1852, Boston, married Daniel Goodnow, a hardware dealer, son of Daniel Goodnow and Anna Bradlee, on 29 June 1871.<sup>19</sup></li>\r\n<li>Anna Cora, born 15 June 1856 at 48 Oak Street, Boston.<sup>20</sup> According to the Welch genealogy, Anna Cora Welch was in an asylum in 1899. In 1880, an Anna C. Welch, age 24, was listed among the patients at the McLean Asylum in Somerville.<sup>21</sup></li>\r\n<li>Abbie Louisa, born 2 January 1858, in Boston;<sup>22</sup> died in 1926 in Boston.<sup>23</sup> In 1916, there was a Suffolk County probate record for Abbie L. Welch for non compos mentis.<sup>24</sup> She never married. </li>\r\n<li>Thomas Francis, born 18 August 1859, 48 Oak Street, Boston.<sup>25</sup></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The letters were addressed to Thomas J. Walsh [sic], 48 Oak Street, Boston, MA. Oak Street was located between Washington Street and Harrison Avenue in the South Cove district of Boston.</p>\r\n<p>In 1864, a letter mentions a financial setback for the Welch family due to a dispute between Thomas J. Welch and his business partner, Mr. Short. Thomas J. Welch had a summer home in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.newenglandancestors.org/8171.htm\">Germantown</a> section of Quincy, on a point of land at the mouth of the Fore River, and the family was forced to live in their Quincy home for a few years. By 1870, they were back on Oak Street.<sup>26</sup> Since Thomas J. Welch died in 1872, his widow sold some of their real estate in 1873.<sup>27</sup> By 1880, Eliza Welch, widow, was living at 627 Tremont Street, at the corner of West Canton Street, in the South End of Boston, with her son Thomas Francis Welch and her daughter, Abby Louisa Welch.<sup>28</sup> By 1900, Eliza had moved to Brookline, MA, where she lived at 7_ University Road.<sup>29</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Harry Welch</strong><br>In 1861, Ann Mulheran commented about the fact that Mr. Harry Welch, succeeded in getting a farm. This was probably Harrison S. Welch, the brother of Thomas J. Welch. Harrison S. Welch was born 20 November 1829<sup>30</sup> in Boston, and was the youngest son of John and Eliza Welch. He married in Boston on 9 November 1856 Elizabeth J. Foster, daughter of John H. and Elizabeth (Allen) Foster of 4 Hollis Street Boston. She had been born in Platte County, Missouri.<sup>31</sup> In 1860, he was living in on a farm in Waltham, Massachusetts that was valued at $15,000, and his personal estate was valued at $1,000. He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts on 28 October 1864. The cause of death was typhoid fever.<sup>32</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Mary McKenna</strong><br>The letters make a number of references to Ann Mulheran&#8217;s cousin, Mary McKenna. She was most likely the servant who was recorded in the Welch household in the 1860 and 1870 census.<sup>33</sup> In fact, the collection includes a letter written by Mary E. McKenna to Lizzie Welch, daughter of Thomas and Mary Eliza Welch, on 5 February 1865. In the letter Mary McKenna addresses Lizzie as &#8220;My Dear Lizzie&#8221; and refers to Mary Eliza Welch as &#8220;Mother.&#8221; The use of these terms sheds light on the close relationship between servant and employer. However, she was writing from the kitchen while the rest of the family was in the dining room having lunch. In her 1865 letter to Lizzie Welch, Mary McKenna wrote that she was going to have some photographs taken and sent to her (Mary&#8217;s) grandmother. Mary also wrote that she had made mistakes in the letter, thus implying that she was writing the letter herself. Mary was not with the Welch family in the 1880 census. </p>\r\n<p>There were three McKenna heads-of-households in the parish of Kilronan in Griffiths Valuation: Terence McKenna in the townland of Seltannaveeny, and Owen and Stephen McKenna in the townland of Giddaun.<sup>34</sup> The townland of Giddaun was located near Seltannaveeny, and Stephen McKenna was the godfather of Ann Mulheran&#8217;s sister, Eliza, as noted above. </p>\r\n<p><strong>William F. Tansey</strong><br>In her letter of 30 August 1861, Ann Mulheran wrote to Mrs. Welch inquiring about William F. Tansy and his whereabouts. William F. Tansey was married to Margaret M. Bulger in Fall River, Massachusetts on 30 April 1864 by a Catholic priest, Rev. Edward Murphy. William F. Tansey was listed as a soldier, and was the son of William and Margaret (Fuller) Tansey, and she was the daughter of Owen and Bridget (Cronan) Bulger.<sup>35</sup></p>\r\n<p>William F. Tansey joined the 5th Rhode Island Heavy Artillery on 16 December 1861 at Fall River, Massachusetts, and was mustered in as a Sergeant in Company C. He was promoted to Full First Sergeant on 1 February 1863; and he was discharged for promotion on 16 April 1864 at Little Washington, North Carolina. He was then appointed Full First Lieutenant, Company K, in the 14th Rhode Island Colored Heavy Artillery on 16 March 1864. He was mustered out on 2 October 1865.<sup>36</sup> The 14th Rhode Island Colored Heavy Artillery was designated the 11th Heavy Artillery on 21 May 1864, and was assigned to garrison duty in New Orleans. His 1864 discharge paper recorded that he had been born in Roscommon, Ireland, and was 5 feet 6 &#190; inches in height, and had a dark complexion and blue eyes. His occupation was listed as a painter.<sup>37</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Thomas Cull</strong><br>In her letter of 19 March 1861, Ann Mulheran made the following reference: &#8220;Mr. Thomas Cull and family are well, and are thankful to you for your kind inquiries. He often complains of me for not going and make a home of his place.&#8221; In Griffiths Valuation of Ireland, a Thomas Coll lived in the townland of Tullynahaw, parish of Kilronan, County Roscommon, and as did Owen Coll and James Coll.<sup>38</sup> &#160;The townland of Tullnahaw is located adjacent to the townland of Seltannaveeny, where Ann Mulheran lived. </p>\r\n<p>Nothing is known about Ann Mulheran after her last letter of _____, in which she stated that she had purchased a ticket to Australia. If Ann had immigrated to Australia, why would she not write to let Mrs. Welch know she had arrived safely? Once she achieved her goal of obtaining enough money to emigrate, did Ann see no further use to correspond with Mrs. Welch? <br><br></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><sup>1</sup> Baptism record, Roscommon Heritage &amp; Genealogy Company, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://roscommon.brsgenealogy.com/\">http://roscommon.brsgenealogy.com/</a>. </p>\r\n<p><sup>2</sup> Baptism record, Roscommon Heritage &amp; Genealogy Company, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://roscommon.brsgenealogy.com/\">http://roscommon.brsgenealogy.com/</a>. </p>\r\n<p><sup>3</sup> Kilronan Parish Website, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.kilronanparish.ie/\">http://www.kilronanparish.ie/</a></p>\r\n<p><sup>4</sup><em>Ordnance Survey of Ireland, 1823-1844</em>.

My neighbors drank milk \r\nas children. Therefore, my neighbors must be serial killers. Or, all \r\nmilk drinkers are serial killers.&#8221; Some might have extended the argument\r\n to say, &#8220;Therefore, milk causes homicidal tendencies.&#8221; Anyone who took \r\nLogic 101 in college knows about this fallacious argument, which \r\nerroneously applies the characteristic of a small subset (serial \r\nkillers) to another subset (neighbors) or to a large population (all \r\nmilk drinkers). But similar errors of logic sometimes appear in \r\ngenealogies. Many myths about surnames have been generalized from \r\nobservations about particular families. Genealogists err in relying on \r\nthese myths or assumptions instead of searching for evidence, in making \r\nomissions while searching for surnames, or in discarding <em>bona fide</em>\r\n ancestors from the family tree. The following is a far-from-exhaustive \r\nlist of myths and assumptions that sometimes lead the beginning \r\ngenealogist astray.</p>\r\n <p><em>Many of the Sullivans came from the Beara \r\npeninsula in County Cork. My ancestor is named Sullivan. Therefore, my \r\nancestor came from the Beara peninsula.</em></p>\r\n <p>While the Sullivan \r\nancestor may have originated from Beara, there were still plenty of \r\nSullivans elsewhere in Ireland&#8212; Kerry, Limerick, Galway and Tipperary, \r\nfor instance. Genealogists cannot look at a map showing the distribution\r\n of surnames in Ireland and deduce that their ancestors came from a \r\nparticular place. Records providing the origin of an Irish immigrant \r\nancestor most often are found in the New World country, so genealogists \r\nmust focus their initial research there rather than in Ireland.</p>\r\n <p><em>This\r\n person spells his name Matthew Dailey. My ancestor spelled his name \r\nDaley. Therefore, this person cannot be my ancestor.</em></p>\r\n <p>Irish \r\nsurnames were recorded by hurried and careless bureaucrats, who \r\nmisspelled and even made up names. The literacy rate among \r\nnineteenth-century Irish immigrants fleeing hunger and privation was \r\nlow. As a result of their indigence, many were poorly educated and could\r\n not write their names. They signed documents with the letter <em>X</em>. \r\nMatthew Daley&#8217;s surname was spelled Daly, Daley, Daily, Dailey, Dayley, \r\nor Dally in various nineteenth-century records. By 1900, his son had \r\nchanged his name to Daly. By searching for this individual under a \r\nsingle spelling, a researcher would not find many valuable sources. The \r\nproblem of variant spelling is so common to surname indexes that a \r\nspecial indexing system called &#8220;soundex &#8221; was devised to lump similar \r\nsounding names together. Thus, the surname Daly in all its forms would \r\nbe found under D400 in a soundex index. Unfortunately, not all indexes \r\nuse soundex codes, so genealogists must search under many different \r\nspellings of a surname. Genealogists must also remember to search to \r\ninclude the possibility of the O&#8217; or Mc being added or dropped. For \r\ninstance, McCarthy should also be researched under McCarty, McCartney, \r\nCarty and Carthy. A perusal of the O&#8217;Sullivan surname should include \r\nSullivan as well. So researchers must extend their scope to include any \r\nand all variant spellings of surnames.</p>\r\n <p><em>All MacDonalds are \r\nScottish and all McDonalds are Irish.</em></p>\r\n <p>This maxim is useless \r\nto the genealogist since there are so many exceptions. For example, in \r\nPrince Edward Island, records of the Scottish clan spell the name \r\nMcDonald. Furthermore, in the face of predjudice, our ancestors may have\r\n changed the spelling of their surnames to acquire some advantage or \r\navoid some stigma. Thus an Irishman named Owen McDonnell may have \r\nchanged his name to John MacDonald in the New World. Walsh might become \r\nWelch, Mahoney become Matthews, and so on.</p>\r\n <p><em>Many people with \r\nthe surname Mullin are Irish. Therefore, the Mayflower voyager Priscilla\r\n Mullins was Irish.</em></p>\r\n <p>Actually no one knows where Priscilla \r\nMullins was born, but her father was most certainly English. In a \r\nmisplaced quest for status, some Irish-Americans have claimed national \r\nicons as their own. (Their energies might be better spent drawing \r\nattention to the real heroism of Irish immigrants.)</p>\r\n <p><em>The \r\nsurname Kelley indicates a Protestant family, while the surname Kelly \r\nindicates a Catholic one.</em></p>\r\n <p>The particular spelling of a \r\nsurname can result from the choice of a bureaucrat, the illiteracy of an\r\n ancestor, changing customs over time, or the preference of one family \r\nmember. Members of the same family do spell their names differently, and\r\n orthography has nothing to do with religion. The presence of a variant \r\nspelling within a town may, however, sometimes&#8212; but not always&#8212; help \r\ndistinguish one family from another. When using census records, \r\ngenealogists should be aware that the information within a particular \r\ntown may have been gathered by different census takers who used their \r\nown idiosyncratic spelling system. Analysis of handwriting is one way of\r\n determining that more than one census taker was at work in the same \r\narea.</p>\r\n <p><em>Neil McGuigan cannot be the brother of James Goodwin.</em></p>\r\n<p>Before the nineteenth century, most people in the west of Ireland \r\nspoke in the Irish language. Surnames and given names had not been \r\nanglicized. We had ancestors named Grainne O Maille, Diarmuid \r\nMacCartaig, Eilis Ni Feargail, Murraid O Flaitbeartaig, Sile Ni \r\nSuileabain, and Concobar O Docartaig, instead of Grace O&#8217;Malley, \r\nJeremiah McCarthy, Elizabeth Farrell, Morgan Flaherty, Julia Sullivan, \r\nand Cornelius Doherty. Anglicized surnames often appear remarkably \r\ndifferent from the original Irish name. The name McGuigan became Goodwin\r\n or Goodfellow. One brother may have chosen the Irish spelling, another \r\nthe English. Thus a Neil McGuigan could very well have had a brother \r\nnamed James Goodwin.</p>\r\n <p><em>A man named James Mickey Owen could not \r\nbe a member of the Kelly family.</em></p>\r\n <p>In some areas of Ireland, \r\ncertain surnames were so common, an informal naming system based upon \r\nextended family relationships, called patronymics, were used to \r\ndistinguish families. In the parish of Ballinascreen, Co. Derry, the \r\nKellys were &#8220;Mickey Owens&#8221; and &#8220;Johnny Pauls,&#8221; after grandfathers and \r\ngreat- grandfathers. Other common names in certain places developed \r\npatronymics: Dohertys in Inishowen, Co. Donegal, Mahoneys in Bandon, \r\nDonovans in Clonakilty, and Sullivans in Castletownbere, Co. Cork, and \r\nso on. In other cases, a word referring to a physical description was \r\nadded to distinguish the person: Roe or Ruagh, Dubh, or B&#225;n for red, \r\nblack, or light hair, respectively. In the nineteenth-century land \r\ncensus, Griffith&#8217;s Valuation, one may see words like &#8220;hernish&#8221; or &#8220;more&#8221;\r\n in italics after a surname. The name, John McDevitt (hernish), in the \r\nparish of Lower Fahan, Co. Donegal, indicates his family had been the \r\nherenach or church wardens in medieval times. &#8220;More&#8221; meant the \r\nindividual was large. Local and parish histories often provide \r\ninformation about the patronymics of the area&#8217;s leading families.<br><br>This\r\n exercise in Logic 101 was presented to help beginning genealogists \r\nfocus on the true work of tracing their families. They must realize that\r\n easy assumptions about their ancestors&#8217; surnames cannot substitute for \r\nbasic research and hard work. Nevertheless, some knowledge about an \r\nancestor&#8217;s clan or surname may help identify variant names and \r\nspellings. The following list of books and Websites may provide some \r\ninformation regarding particular surnames.<br><br>A number of books \r\ndealing with Irish surnames and clans have been published over the \r\nyears, and many of these can be found in local libraries and LDS branch \r\nlibraries.

Never straying from their dockside slums, they worked as canal diggers and longshoremen, until the ward boss procured them jobs on the police force or at the gas company. The myth holds that their descendants still live in three-decker houses in ethnic ghettos where they march exuberantly on St. Patrick's Day.<br><br>In reality, the story of Irish emigration to America is much more complex. The experience of Donegal immigrants in Woburn, Massachusetts, once a small, industrial community situated among rural farms, provides an alternate view of the Irish-American myth as one shaped by the dynamics of the particular local environment. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p><strong>History of Woburn, Massachusetts <br></strong>With a current population of 36,000, Woburn is a suburban city located about twelve miles northwest of Boston. In 1850, it was mainly an agricultural town with a population of 3,800 persons. In the span of 150 years, the town was transformed into a manufacturing city, and then into a suburban, residential city with a substantial base of technological, research, medical and financial, and even dot-com businesses. <br><br>Established in 1642 by English Puritans fleeing religious persecution, Woburn was initially part of Charlestown, and named for the town of Woburn in Bedfordshire, England. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the town saw major portions split off into separate towns of Burlington, Wilmington and Winchester. The remaining town of Woburn was informally divided into North Woburn, West Woburn, East Woburn or Montvale, and the South End. The inhabitants took part on the rebel side in the American Revolution, and participated in the battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775. The construction of the Middlesex Canal in 1803, which went through Woburn, had a substantial impact on the growth of industry in the town. Operating more than 50 years, the canal was 27 miles long and linked the hinterlands of New Hampshire with Boston, enabling the movement of raw materials and finished products to markets. The coming of the railroad, which crossed Woburn on the east side of town, rendered the canal obsolete, and spurred the growth of industry toward that part of town. <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>The Tanning Industry<br></strong>In 1756, David Cummings established a small, family-run tannery on the west side of Woburn, a business his family was to carry on for the next 150 years. Woburn was linked with the tannery business for just as long, and at one time was one of the largest centers of tanneries in the country. Several factors led to the tremendous growth of Woburn's tanneries in the 1850s - a growth in the national economy, the proliferation of boot and shoe manufacturers in the town, and a growing demand for leather with the nation's increasing population. The arrival of Irish labor was the largest factor for industrial growth in New England. Irish immigrants went wherever there was a river or brook large enough to power a mill wheel. They settled in Massachusetts communities such as Clinton, Hopkinton, Hinsdale, Hopedale, and Saxonville. Clusters of immigrants from certain counties set up a century-long process of chain migration to these towns. In Clinton, they were from County Mayo; in Waltham, they were from Athenry Co.; in Galway, they were from Sneem Co., Kerry; and in Woburn, they were from Donegal. <sup>2</sup><br><br>The Cummings family continued over generations to produce leather, and in the nineteenth century John Cummings expanded his family's tannery business in the western section of Woburn, along a major stream. Another tannery had been built near Horn Pond in 1825 by Abijah Thompson, who later passed the business to his son-in-law, Stephen Dow. The western section of Woburn subsequently was dubbed \"Cummingsville,\" and the Water Street area was dubbed \"Thompsonville.\" In addition, young tannery managers broke away and established their own businesses, so that by 1860 the population of Woburn had increased by sixty percent in one decade. According to census records, there were 6,300 people living in 988 houses, and the Irish comprised about 25 percent of the town's population in that year. The tanneries and town continued to grow through the decades so that by 1884, there were 26 tanneries employing 1,500 men, producing $4.5 million of leather. In 1888, the town had changed its charter and incorporated as a city. <sup>3</sup><br><br>When the railroad began to run through the south end and east side, new tanneries were constructed in these areas, thereby shifting the location of new immigrant housing to those parts of the town. The tanneries underwent a process of consolidation, which suppressed wage competition and generally lowered wages in the late nineteenth century. Labor unions were formed and with strikes and threats of strikes, wages increased. New immigrant labor, consisting mostly of Italians and Greeks, was brought in. <sup>4</sup>Tanneries declined during the Depression, and never recovered. By the 1970s, the last tannery, owned by John J. Reilly, closed. </p>\r\n<p>The process of tanning was initially labor-intensive, and involved two types of work: tanning and currying (or preparing the tanned leather). Tanning was a chemical process that treated hides with increasing concentrations of solutions to remove hair, and to \"tan\" the hides. Currying involved splitting the hides and scrubbing and scraping the rough flesh off. <sup>5</sup><br><br>The work was dangerous, since the employees worked with toxic chemicals and dyes containing chromium and arsenic. The workers moved around on planks between large vats of acid, and if anyone fell in, it was sure death. The beam house, where the hides were prepared for tanning, stunk to the high heavens. The workers absorbed the odors in their clothing and hair, and a Woburn tanner could clear out a trolley car in Boston, no matter how much he tried to wash out the smell. A nurse at the Beggs and Cobb tannery lost twenty pounds in her first two months of work at a tannery, since the stench made her lose her appetite. The tanneries constantly looked for technological innovations to mechanize the processing. Large machine run brushes were used to scrape the flesh off. The air was full of dust, and outside, the coal-powered tannery boilers emitted clouds of coal dust which settled around the workers' houses. <sup>6</sup>Woburn's death records reveal that many tannery workers died of kidney disease from their exposure to the chemicals, from pulmonary disease from the dust, or by accident. <br><br><strong>Inishowen Immigrants in Woburn<br></strong>Immigrants from Inishowen were not the only Irish in Woburn, and Woburn was not the only destination for people born in Inishowen. But, according to census and naturalization records, Woburn contained a significantly large concentration of Inishowen immigrants, comprising about 50 percent of the city's Irish population. Other Irish immigrants came from Monaghan and Louth, and from the Aran Islands in Galway. Specific tanneries would recruit immigrants from certain counties. J. J. Reilly recruited people from the Aran Islands. <sup>7</sup>Cummings and Dow recruited people from Donegal.<br><br>Inishowen immigrants, particularly from the parishes of Carndonagh and Clonmany, had been coming to Boston since the late eighteenth century. Their presence increased substantially in the 1830s with the establishment of major shipping routes from Derry to Saint John, New Brunswick. Many of the New Brunswick Irish ended up in New England. The 1860 census shows that Inishowen people lived initially in the North End of Boston, in the streets around St. Mary's Parish. Later, they settled in Charlestown, East Boston and Roxbury. In 1840, there were few Irish immigrants living in Woburn. But by the second half of the 1840s, a number of Donegal emigrants came to West Woburn, and among them were Philip McEleny of Carrick, parish of Carndonagh; John McLaughlin of Tullynabratily, parish of Clonmany; and John N. Doherty, the son of Dennis and Grace Doherty of the Isle of Doagh parish of Clonmany. <sup>8</sup><br><br>These first Donegal settlers in Woburn were farmers in West Woburn and tannery workers in the Water Street area near Horn Pond, the location of the Dow tannery. Dow built \"tannery houses,\"-- spare, wooden boardinghouses -- for their employees. John McLaughlin ran a boarding house off Water Street. Beginning in 1850, there was a large influx of Donegal emigrants, particularly in the Water Street district and Cummingsville. By 1870, many of these tannery workers had purchased their own land and built their own houses, many of which still stand today. <sup>9</sup>Although the immigrants were initially poor, many climbed to the ranks of homeowners within twenty years of their arrival.<br><br>Not all of the Donegal Irish in West Woburn were Catholic. Alexander Porter, James Henry Graham, and the Cassidy family were members of Protestant churches in Woburn. Born in 1871, James Henry Graham was the son of John Graham and Sarah Ray, and belonged to the Orange Order. <sup>10</sup>There was no evidence or tradition of animosity among the Donegal immigrants of varying religious affiliations. </p>\r\n<p>For several years, Catholics in Woburn had to travel eight miles to Cambridge to attend Sunday Mass. But in 1843, Fr. James Strain traveled out from East Cambridge to say Mass in the town hall. He was succeeded by Fr. Manasses O'Doherty from 1846 through 1849. <sup>11</sup>A native of Inishowen, Fr. O'Doherty had been assigned first to St. Mary's Church in Houlton, Maine, and then St. John's Church in East Cambridge, and he subsequently established St. Mary's, St. Peter's, and St. Paul's churches, all in Cambridge. <sup>12</sup>In fact, Fr. O'Doherty's presence and encouragement may have attracted Inishowen people to Woburn in this time period. Although St. Charles' Parish had been established in Woburn in 1843, the first regular pastor, Fr. John Quealy of Co. Waterford, was not appointed until 1856. For many years, some Donegal immigrants in Woburn continued to go into St. Peter's Church in Cambridge to have Fr. O'Doherty marry them and baptize their children. St. Charles' Church was built in 1853 along Main Street, near the center of town, so the West Woburn Donegal Irish were not necessarily under the eagle eye of the priest. Although the church was important to the West Woburn Catholics, distance may have prevented the pastor from assuming the traditional dominant role, as in other nineteenth-century Catholic parishes.<br><br>Furthermore, St. Charles' Parochial School was not built until 1884. Woburn required that all children between the ages of 6 and 16 attend school, and before 1884, that would have meant public school. <sup>13</sup>Even after 1884, many Catholic schoolchildren attended public, not parochial school. In the nineteenth century, most of the Irish children attended school at least through the age of 14 or 15 years. But truancy was a problem, and in 1868, the truancy rate was 10 to 15 percent. <sup>14</sup>The 1870 census shows that the literacy rate among Donegal men was around 70 percent, and among Donegal women around 30 percent. Although many people attended classes at night, quite a few of the older immigrants remained illiterate all their lives. By 1880, census records indicate that the literacy rate among the newer immigrants had risen, so that most could read and write. During the Civil War, a number of Irish immigrants in Woburn enlisted in the Union Army. Woburn's Yankee inhabitants (descendants of the original English immigrants) were strongly abolitionist in the 1850s, and had advocated for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act. Like other towns in Massachusetts, Woburn was initially reluctant to recruit soldiers from the ranks of the recently arrived Irish immigrants. However, by 1862, the Irish began enlisting in greater numbers. <sup>15</sup>Several Irish immigrants in Woburn enlisted in the 39th Massachusetts Regiment, and they saw heavy action in battles at Laurel Hill and Weldon Railroad, Virginia in 1864. Private Michael Finn, Sergeant William McDevitt, Private Peter Doherty, and Private Philip Doherty were all wounded. While William McDevitt and Philip Doherty recovered from their wounds, Peter Doherty died at a Washington, D.C. hospital. Michael Finn died in Confederate custody, as did several other Woburn men, who died of starvation and disease in Confederate prison camps. <sup>16</sup>The support of the Union cause in the Civil War was a major factor in the Irish gaining acceptance in American society, an assertion supported by the letters of the 39th Regiment Woburn enlistees.<br><br>The sale and consumption of alcohol became a major political issue dividing the old Yankee prohibitionist community and the Irish newcomers. By 1866, there were 159 arrests for drunkenness, liquor law violations, and assault and battery. In 1870, there were sixty establishments selling liquor illegally, all run by Irish immigrants. Given the tradition of distilling liquor in Donegal, it is not surprising that some of these \"shebeens\" were run by Donegal immigrants. The political issue of completely banning the sale of alcohol or regulating the sales through a licensing system was debated and voted on at many town meetings and elections, until the Irish attained a majority in the late 1890s. After that, the issue went away until the 1920s. <sup>17</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Later Immigration<br></strong>Donegal emigrants continued to come to Woburn throughout the nineteenth century, and the numbers that came in the 1880s and 1890s may have exceeded the numbers of Famine emigrants. The tannery businesses continued to thrive, so that by 1884, there were 26 tanneries employing 1,500 workers. <sup>18</sup>The people who arrived thirty and forty years after the Famine were undoubtedly related to the earlier immigrants - nieces and nephews, cousins and friends. But they moved into a different neighborhood: the South End. The Dow tannery burned down in 1893, and the Cummings tannery in 1901, leaving hundreds of people out of work. The focus of the tannery industry shifted to the east side of Main Street, closer to the railroad. As Dow and Cummings had done, these tanneries built boarding houses for their workers, which were plain, spare domiciles, usually situated in the immediate vicinity. With the major tanneries gone, West Woburn reverted to its agricultural past, and this time with many greenhouses. Among the later immigrants in West Woburn was Alexander Porter, born in Donegal in 1865, who came directly to Woburn at the age of eighteen years. After working as a farm hand, he later bought his own farm, and eventually had eleven greenhouses along Burlington Street in West Woburn. <sup>19</sup><br><br>The 1900 census indicates that Donegal immigrants of the late nineteenth century lived in new housing built along newly subdivided streets off Main Street. Even 120 years later, many of the houses are still quite attractive. Although the prospect across Main Street was grimly industrial, the neighborhood looked out in the other direction over the sylvan landscape of Horn Pond. One of the Donegal emigrants who came in this period was Dennis Dever, the grandfather of Robert Dever, the recent mayor of Woburn. Dennis Dever emigrated in 1889 through New York, and lived initially on Stoddard Street. <sup>20</sup>His son, Philip was on the city council for many years. <br><br>By the late nineteenth century, the Irish had prospered in Woburn, and were participating more fully in the business and social life of the city. Many of the older Donegal immigrants had turned to other occupations such as farming, or running small commercial establishments, such as hotels, restaurants, and stores. They ran for political office, joined the police force and the fire department, and worked in Woburn municipal departments. The first Irishman was elected to the Board of Selectmen in 1881, and two more were elected the following year. By 1885, an Irishman, James Maguire, was Chairman of the Board of Selectmen. By 1887, a new bank had been organized with Irishmen on the board, and its first loan was to a James Callahan. <sup>21</sup><br><br>Donegal emigrants continued to settle in Woburn in the early part of the twentieth century, usually around the South End area. By 1920 though, the first and second generation Irish were spreading out around Woburn, moving into new housing and different neighborhoods. At the tanneries, other immigrants from Italy, Greece, and Turkey joined them. The 1920 census shows a number of Donegal immigrants who had arrived in the period from 1900 through 1910. Some continued to arrive in the teens, but emigration dropped sharply during World War One. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries Donegal emigrants moved from one community of compatriots to another in the Boston area - the North End, Charlestown, Woburn, East Boston, and Roxbury. The Devers reportedly owned a couple of apartment buildings in the North End, where they would put up newly arrived greenhorns until they found themselves jobs and places to live. Among these rotating families was James McEleny, who immigrated to Boston in 1916 from Glack, parish of Carndonagh, and lived in Roxbury before coming to Woburn to work in a tannery. <sup>22</sup>His grandson, John McEleny, is a well-known lawyer in Woburn, and author of the most recent history, <em>Woburn: A Past Observed</em> . As long as the tanneries thrived in Woburn, and young men and women left Ireland to seek their fortune, Inishowen emigrants continued to arrive in Woburn.<br><br>The tanneries suffered a great decline during the Depression, and the incentive for new immigrants to settle in Woburn lessened too. Unfortunately, later census material is not yet available to review the birthplaces and arrival dates, so obituaries are the only other source of data. As the population of the area expanded, many people moved out to neighboring towns such as Stoneham, Wakefield, and Reading, among them the Dever family of Cummingsville. In the 1950s, Woburn evolved into a suburban, bedroom community, as many young families moved into new housing in the postwar period. New high tech businesses sprang up along Route 128, which runs through North Woburn. New immigrants from Puerto Rico and the Caribbean came to Woburn in the 1950s and 1960s, and St. Charles' Church began having Spanish masses for them. Today, the city's economic base is a mixture of 40 percent residential, 13 percent industrial, 10 percent open space, 4 percent commercial and 2 percent agricultural. <sup>23</sup>Some descendants of Donegal immigrants still live in the city - a recent mayor (2001) was a Dever, the former chief of police was a McEleny, and the current head of the library is an O'Doherty. There are still Doherty and Kelly descendants in Cummingsville. The tanneries are gone, replaced by high-tech companies and dot-coms, financial and medical facilities, and shopping malls. But the tanneries left deadly remnants of their presence - toxins, such as arsenic and chromium, which have polluted the soils and rivers of the city. In the early 1980s, a chemical company and a tannery allegedly contaminated the drinking water with industrial solvents, tetrachloroethylene and tricloroethylene. This resulted in a highly publicized case that was documented in a book, <em>A Civil Action </em><sup>24</sup>and later portrayed in a movie starring John Travolta. The water is now safe to drink, and the largest, \"superfund\" contaminated site in North Woburn has been largely paved over, and is the location of new industrial parks. The city is known for its excellent school system and library, and is a desirable place to live, convenient to public transportation, shopping areas, and workplaces. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion<br></strong>The saga of Irish emigration to Woburn and other New England mill towns was one of long duration, one in which Irish skilled labor enabled the expansion industries and the growth of wealth. Inishowen emigrants came as young men and women seeking their fortunes in the New World, and less as unwilling paupers driven from their homeland in coffin ships. In fact, some left home despite the opposition of their parents. Within 15 years of their arrival, they had been accepted by many as valuable contributors to the Union cause. Within twenty years, many had purchased land and built their own homes. Within 35 years, they had attained political power. While they did not occupy the rarified air of Boston Brahmin society, they were not the ditch-digging, ignorant gangsters portrayed in the media. The process of assimilation was accelerated in small American communities such as Woburn, where the Irish and Yankee inhabitants were engaged in social and political dialogue, and where the Irish did not withdraw into parochial, urban ghettos. Their economic progress was limited as long as Woburn remained a one-industry city. But with the failure of the tanneries, Woburn inhabitants could choose among many occupations. With access to good education, the Woburn Irish could move up into white-collar jobs, and move into the middle class. At this point in time, the descendants of Irish immigrants have been fully integrated into American life, and wonder about their families' lives in a time and place long forgotten. </p>\r\n<sup>1.</sup>John D.

Daly", "country": "Ireland", "title": "Researching Ancestors in Ireland from 1850 to 1901", "content": "<p>Although the largest number of Irish immigrants came to North America at the time of the Great Famine from 1846 through 1851, an economic downturn in Ireland in the 1880s drove a smaller but significant number of Irish immigrants to America. Researching these emigrants can be especially challenging due to the lack of 1890 American census records and pre-1901 Irish census records. Available at the Family History Library, the revised valuation lists can provide useful information about heads-of-households for the period 1850 to 1901.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\">The case of Cornelius Riley is an example of how the revised valuations can be useful. Cornelius Riley immigrated as a child with his family to America in 1883, and settled in the Stonington, Connecticut and Westerly, Rhode Island area. His death record and obituary stated that he had been born in 1872 in Valencia, Ireland. He worked in slate quarries, as did his father and brother, both named Michael Riley. Born in 1835, Cornelius&#8217; father Michael Riley had married Hannah Sullivan probably in the late 1850s, and was therefore too young to be listed in Griffith&#8217;s Primary Valuation, a mid-nineteenth century census substitute of land occupiers. But the Rhode Island death record of Michael Riley Sr. indicated that his father was also named Michael Riley. Unfortunately, a search of Griffith&#8217;s Primary Valuation did not turn up any Rileys in Valencia, which is an island and a parish off the coast of the Iveragh peninsula in County Kerry. In my research, I noted that the name Riley in County Kerry is a corruption of the surname Rahilly, a clan native to the area around Killarney.<sup>1</sup> Knowing the variant spellings of Irish surnames is important in identifying our ancestors in Irish records.<br><br>I also found in the 1900 census that Michael Riley&#8217;s son (and Cornelius Riley&#8217;s brother) lived in a multi-family dwelling in Stonington, CT, and that his neighbors were named Shea and Sullivan, surnames common to the Iveragh peninsula and Valencia. A review of common Kerry surnames in the tombstone inscriptions of Saint Michaels Cemetery (Old), Pawcatuck, Stonington, revealed a number of immigrants from Valencia.<sup>2</sup> So I had found evidence of a cluster of Valencia immigrants in the Stonington-Westerly area. <br><br>The 1900 census indicated that Michael Riley Jr. had immigrated to the United States in 1883.<sup>3</sup> Neither Michael Riley Sr. nor any of his sons (Michael Riley Sr. also had a son, John Riley, who settled in Templeton, Massachusetts) naturalized, so this often fruitful record of immigrants&#8217; origins was not available. However, I still thought the death record and obituary of Cornelius Riley, both of which stated he had been born in Valencia, were accurate. So I sent for the Family History films of the &#8220;revised&#8221; valuations, sometimes called the &#8220;cancelled land books,&#8221; for the parish of Valencia, County Kerry.<br><br><strong>Ordering Revised Valuations</strong><br>Initially designed and collected under the direction of Richard Griffith, &#8220;Griffith&#8217;s Valuation&#8221; of Ireland is a nineteenth century, head-of-household, census substitute of land occupiers. The information for this first valuation was gathered around 1848 plus or minus a few years, and several versions were published. There is an online index to the Primary Valuation on the website, <a href=\"http://www.failteromhat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.failteromhat.com/</a>. For a fee, researchers can access online the complete records of the primary valuation on Eneclann&#8217;s website <a href=\"http://www.irishorigins.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.irishorigins.com/</a>. The complete records can be viewed on microfiche in the NEHGS library<sup>4</sup> and at many libraries around North America. <br><br>The information in Griffith&#8217;s Primary Valuation was collected beginning in 1848, and listed heads-of households. Usually these were adult married or widowed persons. So Michael and Hannah (Sullivan) Riley would have been too young to be listed, since their children were born from the late 1850s through 1872. So I was really looking for records from a later period. This is where the revised valuations come in.<br><br>The Irish government continued to periodically revise the valuations over the next 150 years, just as your town tax assessors periodically revise the valuation on your house and property. These records are maintained in the Valuation Office in Dublin. See their website, <a href=\"http://www.valoff.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.valoff.ie/</a>. The revised valuations are not on their website. However, North American researchers can look at the microfilms of the revised valuations in the Family History Library in Salt Lake City, by borrowing the films through Family History Library branches near them, or through the NEHGS library. These are the steps a researcher should take to find the films:<br><ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>Determine the parish or townland of origin of your immigrant ancestor. This must be done in North American records, not Irish records. How to do this will not be discussed in this article. For more information about this subject, please visit our online lecture, Getting Started in Irish Genealogy. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Next, you must determine the Registration District and the District Electoral Division (DED) in which the townland lies. In 1898, the poor law unions were divided into 829 Registration Districts and 3,751 District Electoral Divisions. You can find the registration district and electoral division by consulting George B. Handran&#8217;s book, <em>Townlands in Poor Law Unions</em>.<sup>5</sup> If you don&#8217;t have access to this book, you can consult the Department of Agriculture in Ireland website <a href=\"http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/farmerschemespayments/singlepaymentscheme/categoriesofdisadvantagedareas/\">http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/farmerschemespayments/singlepaymentscheme/categoriesofdisadvantagedareas/</a> which has the DED&#8217;s arranged by county. In the case of Valencia, the Registration District was Cahersiveen. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Once you know the district and DED, go to the Family History Library website homepage, at <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.familysearch.org/</a>and select the Library tab. Then click on the Family History Library Catalog option. Select the &#8220;place search&#8221; option, and enter the name of the county (e.g. Kerry) and Ireland. Then choose the Ireland, Kerry (or other county) hyperlink. It will not work if you type in Cahersiveen, Kerry for the place search.<br><br></li>\r\n<li>You will then see a <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Library/fhlcatalog/supermainframeset.asp?display=localitydetails&amp;subject=5412&amp;subject_disp=Ireland,+Kerry&amp;columns=*,0,0\" target=\"_blank\">list of subject options</a>, one of which will be &#8220;land and property.&#8221; When you click on this, you will get a substantial <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Library/fhlcatalog/supermainframeset.asp?display=topicdetails&amp;subject=441816&amp;subject_disp=Ireland,+Kerry+%2D+Land+and+property&amp;columns=*,0,0\" target=\"_blank\">list of records</a> to choose from. Look for the Valuation List for County Kerry (or whatever county you typed in) and the name of the district, in this case Cahersiveen. The revised valuation lists for Cahersiveen range from 1860 to 1952. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Click on the &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Library/fhlcatalog/supermainframeset.asp?display=titledetails&amp;titleno=146671&amp;disp=Valuation+lists+for+Kerry+County,+Cahe%20%20&amp;columns=*,0,0\">Valuation lists for Kerry County, Cahersiveen Rural District, 1860-1952</a>&#8221; option, and you will get a more complete description of the record, including the fact that there are thirteen microfilm reels. Click on the gray button labeled &#8220;view film notes.&#8221;<br><br></li>\r\n<li>You will now see a <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Library/fhlcatalog/supermainframeset.asp?display=titlefilmnotes&amp;columns=*,0,0&amp;titleno=146671&amp;disp=Valuation+lists+for+Kerry+County,+Cahe++\">list of all the electoral divisions </a>in the Cahersiveen Rural District. Among them is Valencia. This list will give you the film number(s) to order. Write down the information and place your film order with the librarian at the Family History Library or at NEHGS. <br><br></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<strong>Using Revised Valuation Lists</strong><br><ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>Research the film backwards. Once your order has arrived at NEHGS or the local Family History Library branch library, you can search the revised valuations in many cases into the twentieth century. But you need to know the organization of the film first. As I stated previously, the valuations were revised every few years or so, not necessarily on a regular schedule. The valuations are organized by townland, but it is not necessary to know the townland name to search the revised valuations, though it does make your search quicker. Each time the valuations were revised, the new pages were placed in a binder on top of the previous valuations. So the binders are in reverse order, from newest to oldest. This fact is important, since the microfilm reels are also in reverse order. You can research in any direction you want, but it does make sense to start your search at the end, where the oldest valuations are, and work your way backward on the film (and therefore forward in time).<br><br></li>\r\n<li>Look for changes in occupancy. With each revaluation, changes in the names of the occupants, immediate lessors, valuations and even lot numbering may occur. Watch for changes in all of these factors, especially for changes in occupants and lot numbers. Whenever the information changed, the previous occupant was crossed out and the new information written just above the line. So you should be on the lookout for your ancestor appearing as new occupant, as he reached adulthood, moved into the area or took over his parents&#8217; holding. In the case of Michael Riley Sr. of Valencia, he appeared as Michael Rahilly in a revaluation of the late 1850s, around the time of his marriage. <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/pdfs/mrahilly.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see example</a>. The previous occupant, John Lenihan, was crossed out, and the name Michael Rahilly was written above. Note that his name was recorded as Michael Rahilly, not Riley. He leased a house and garden at #7 Jane Street in the village of Knightstown in Valencia. The record also indicates changes in the immediate lessor. The previous lessor, &#8220;Jane Blackman&#8221; was crossed out, and the word &#8220;Same,&#8221; referring to the first entry above, &#8220;Robert Lecky and the Valencia Slab Company&#8221;. So Michael Rahilly was probably a stonecutter in the slate quarry. By 1883, the slate quarry on Valencia had closed, and the entire area was economically depressed. In that year, the British government implemented a funded emigration scheme in which Valencia residents were given money to emigrate: &#163;5 for adults, &#163;2.50 for children and &#163;1 for infants. The Board of Guardians, who administered the scheme, required that the families emigrate as a whole. The first group sailed on board the S. S. Belgravia, leaving Valencia on 1 June 1883, and arriving in New York on 12 June 1883.<sup>6</sup> Among the emigrants on board was Nora (The given name Hannah and Hanora are often used interchangeably, and Nora is the nickname for Hanora.) Rahilly and her children, whose names and ages matched the Riley family of Westerly and Stonington.<sup>7</sup><br><br></li>\r\n<li>The actual records in Dublin are in color, whereas the FHL films are in black and white. Seeing the records in color is an advantage, but is not absolutely necessary to research the revised valuation lists. Sometimes the assessors did not make out a new list each time the lots were revalued. They just kept crossing out previous occupiers and writing in the new occupiers, until they had a stack of names consisting of crossed out names topped by the most current occupier. They used colored inks to indicate the year of the revaluation. Often the key to the colors is written on the index page. But the FHL films are in black and white. So you may not be able to tell the year of the change, just the fact that a change occurred. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Look for changes in lot numbering. These numbers and letters correspond with maps at the Valuation Office. Over time and especially after the Great Famine, land holdings were consolidated, especially in areas of high mortality and emigration. In the left-hand column of the valuations are numbers designating the lot number or street address, and upper and/or lower case letters, designating land only and/or dwellings respectively. In the case of towns, the street address is given. So Michael Rahilly lived at #7 Jane Street. For my own ancestor, James Murphy of Rahalisk, parish of Macroom, County Cork, he lived at Lot #4, dwelling place #e. This was one of five houses on the lot, with #a being the &#8220;big house.&#8221; In the subsequent valuation, #e was gone. In some cases you may find that your ancestor&#8217;s house was torn down. In the case of James Murphy, the building was converted to a farm building (a pig sty to be exact). <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Look at who occupied your ancestor&#8217;s dwelling place after he/she emigrated. After the Rahillys (Rileys) emigrated from Valencia, the landlord continued leasing #7 Jane Street to others. Continue your research of the address as far as you can. There are books in the Valuation Office that go up to the present day. The FHL library films may stop in the twentieth century. Determining the last occupier will help you find the house if you choose to visit the location. Neighborhood residents may not remember your ancestors, especially since they emigrated. But they may remember people who stayed and lived there in the past 100 years. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<strong>Conclusion</strong><br>Many of our Irish ancestors immigrated to North America, Australia or even South America in the post-Famine decades. The revised valuation lists help researchers track the Irish population in a period when few other records survive. The valuation lists may even help identify a still-standing structure that was our &#8220;ancestral home,&#8221; no matter how humble. The Valuation Office in Dublin is the ideal place to carry out this research, but an &#8220;arm-chair&#8221; researcher can use the resources of the Family History Library to determine the changes in land occupancy over time. <br><br><hr>\r\n<br><strong>Endnotes</strong><br><sup>1</sup>Edward MacLysaght, <em>Irish Families; Their Names, Arms, and Origins</em>.

I have found that it&#8217;s not whether or not you find your ancestor that&#8217;s \r\nimportant; it&#8217;s whether you have used the particular index to the fullest \r\npotential. I will go into some detail with what I consider three major indexes \r\nthat we are all familiar with. Maybe my suggestions will open up a new avenue of \r\nlogic or strategy that you have not previously thought of \r\nbefore.<br><br><strong>International Genealogical Index (IGI)</strong><br>The IGI is so \r\nwell known that you might wonder why I am even discussing it. This is because \r\nthe Irish portion of the IGI is so misunderstood as to lead you into the wrong \r\nlineage if you&#8217;re not careful. In review, the IGI is a computer database \r\nproduced by the LDS Church. It is widely available and <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\">online</a>. It contains the following: \r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>Extractions of original church baptismal/birth and marriage records (of all \r\ndenominations) and extractions of government birth and marriage records. These \r\nextractions from original records have a cited source from which to go and check \r\nfor accuracy. However, do not always assume that the entry is for your ancestor. \r\nThe reason I stress this is because the Family History Library does not have a \r\ncomplete collection of Irish church records let alone extracted ones. This \r\ndecreases the chances of finding your ancestor because coverages of extracted \r\nrecords are so poor.<br><br>I don&#8217;t want to leave this point sounding negative. \r\nI have solved many research problems using the extractions from the IGI, but you \r\ncan&#8217;t use it in the same way you would for Scotland or England due to the lack \r\nof coverage for Ireland. Extracted entries are most commonly noted by a code &#8220;C&#8221; \r\nfor christening/birth or &#8220;M&#8221; for marriage.<br><br>I should also mention that \r\nmany entries from extracted records which have not yet been released on the IGI \r\nare being released to the public on CD by the LDS Church. The major release so \r\nfar which has some Irish Civil Registration and many Catholic parish registers \r\nis the &#8220;British Isles Vital Records Index.&#8221; This disk should always be used with \r\nthe IGI especially for the first decade of Irish Civil Registration of \r\nbirths.<br><br></li>\r\n<li>The IGI also contains genealogy submitted by individual LDS members and \r\ntheir sources can contain wills, censuses, published genealogies, family Bibles, \r\nhearsay, personal knowledge, guesswork or all the above. It used to be that the \r\noriginal submission form could be examined which would provide the name of the \r\npersons who submitted the entry and a source for the submission. Having access \r\nto the original submissions was nice because often decent sources would be \r\nlisted. Presently, the submitter&#8217;s name is not included nor are the \r\nsources.<br><br>Although there are problems with submissions not all is lost. I \r\nrecently found where a client of mine had two different branches of his Irish \r\nCatholic immigrant ancestor&#8217;s family submitted on the IGI by two separate \r\npeople, one living in Utah and one living in California. One of the source \r\nsheets mentioned a family Bible. I was thrilled! So while I had more complete \r\ninformation than those submissions on the IGI, those entries lead me into other \r\nareas of research which are proving to be equally as valuable.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Ancestral File</strong><br>The Ancestral File is a computer-linked database \r\ncreated by the LDS Church and is open for all people to submit their pedigrees \r\nand family group charts on the <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\">Internet</a>. Sometimes the information is great and \r\noften it needs to be verified. Instead of looking for the easy answers here \r\nstart looking for further clues.<br><br>An example of this hit home with me just \r\nthis past December. I was consulting with a lady who was visiting the Family \r\nHistory Library and she pulled out a family group sheet which she had printed \r\noff the Ancestral File. This sheet had the lineage back into the 1700s with \r\nexact townlands. I, of course, was prepared to tell her to take it with a grain \r\nof salt until I started looking at it more closely. The Ancestral File showed \r\nthat someone had joined the LDS Church in the 1860s. This caught my eye because \r\nall of a sudden it dawned on me that this was the person giving the information \r\nwhich was preserved in LDS Church registers and then someone subsequently \r\nsubmitted onto the Ancestral File database. This early Mormon convert would have \r\nknown many of the people mentioned.<br><br>In fact the client was doing all the \r\nright things. To find out where the ancestors were from in Ireland she was \r\ntaking all the brothers and sisters of the immigrant and tracing them out. She \r\nhad traced the branch that went to New York, the branch that went to Wisconsin, \r\nand now she found this strange entry on the Ancestral File and did not realize \r\nthat it meant there was also a Utah branch of the family.<br><br>Use the \r\nAncestral File without the attachment that you&#8217;ll find the magic answers and \r\nstart using it with the hope of a new clue here or there. Even if it&#8217;s only the \r\nsubmitter&#8217;s name that may lead into something new and \r\nexciting.<br><br><strong>Griffith&#8217;s Primary Valuation Index</strong><br>Broderbund has put \r\nan index to Griffith&#8217;s Primary Valuation on CD for sale to the public. Yes, \r\nthere are problems with the index; entire Poor Law Unions are missing, names are \r\nskipped and it can be a pain to use. However, having said this, I can&#8217;t imagine \r\ndoing my research without it.<br><br>In fact I seldom find the people I&#8217;m \r\nlooking for on the Griffith&#8217;s Index. What I do find are those valuable clues \r\nthat lead me to something else which does solve my problem. For this reason \r\nalone, the Griffith&#8217;s CD will always be part of my research at the Family \r\nHistory Library. This is what I&#8217;ve learned from almost daily use of the product: \r\n</p>\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>The dates that Griffith&#8217;s was originally published for a particular civil \r\nparish are not listed anywhere on the disk. The only dates given are 1848-1864 \r\nwhich can be a problem if you&#8217;re looking for 1848 and the entries you need don&#8217;t \r\ndate until 1864. By the way Griffith&#8217;s started in 1847 (in County Dublin) not \r\n1848. So be aware of the date problem. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Make sure you are armed with all the information from the immigrant side of \r\nthe waters. If you don&#8217;t know where in Ireland or if you know a county, you can \r\nuse the disk with some degree of success. For example, if your ancestor had \r\nchildren christened in a Catholic parish in Chicago, then take the names of the \r\ngodparents and assume (it never hurts to assume even if you&#8217;re wrong) that they \r\nall came from the same parish in Ireland. So plug in not only your ancestor&#8217;s \r\nnames, but the surnames of the godparents and see if a pattern emerges. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to use the disk if your ancestors emigrated from Ireland \r\nbefore Griffith&#8217;s began. Make the guess that some of your ancestor&#8217;s brothers, \r\nsisters or a parent were living in the old family home place when Griffith&#8217;s was \r\ntaken. To find those who stayed behind would be to indirectly find your \r\nancestor. Even if your ancestors came in the 1700s, you can use the same theory \r\nin two different ways. For an uncommon name, take my surname Radford for \r\nexample, it&#8217;s not a native Gaelic surname but a transplant from England. If you \r\nwere to plug Radford into the CD Index, you would overwhelmingly come up with \r\nCounty Wexford as the place of settlement. The second way to use it would be to \r\ntake the associations of your eighteenth century immigrant ancestor (the \r\nneighbors, those they went to church with, etc) and then plug all the names in \r\nto see in which county they are all concentrated. This statistical survey often \r\nworks since some branches of the family never left the home parish. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong><br>I hope this has been helpful. It is by no means \r\nexhaustive. However, these are three of the indexes that I use the most and can \r\ncause the most problems if not approached with care and often a sense of \r\nhumor.<br><br>Dwight A.

Wexford, Great-Grandfather of the President", "content": "<p>Since John F. Kennedy was elected U.S. President in \r\n1960, much has appeared in print on his Irish and American ancestors U [1]. \r\nHowever, to this writer's knowledge no research has been conducted on the Irish \r\nantecedents of the immigrant Patrick1 Kennedy, who left Dunganstown, co. \r\nWexford, in the famine years of the late 1840s. This article will briefly \r\noutline new material on the Irish Kennedys and the first generation of Kennedys \r\nand connected families in the U.S. The writer hopes to extend this research, in \r\ncollaboration with an Irish researcher, to earlier generations of Kennedys in \r\nco. Wexford.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>From census and vital records we may infer that Patrick1 Kennedy was born \r\nabout 1823. That his birthplace was the townland of Dunganstown, parish of \r\nWhitechurch, co. Wexford, is a family tradition; apparently no official record, \r\nsuch as a baptism, naturalization or headstone inscription, corroborates it. The \r\nonly clue to his parents' names is a notation in the Loretta Kennedy Connolly \r\ncollection at the Kennedy Library that they were Patrick and Mary Johanna (----) \r\nKennedy of Dunganstown.</p>\r\n<p>Roman Catholic parish registers of White church, co. Wexford begin in 1824. A \r\nsearch of baptisms between 1824 and 1830 by the rector uncovered no Kennedy \r\nbaptisms. Possibly the family worshipped at a nearby church; the registers of \r\nseveral surrounding parishes are now being searched.&#160; Some of these registers \r\ndate from the late 1700s, so it is hoped that earlier generations may also be \r\ntraced. The Tithe Applotment Book of 1824 for Dunganstown shows a Patrick \r\nKennedy with 16 acres, 1 rod, 17 poles; Patrick Kennedy <em>Junior</em> with 2 \r\nacres, 3 rods, 39 poles; and Martin Kennedy with 8 acres, 0 rods, 20 poles.</p>\r\n<p>Omitting Martin Kennedy, whose relationship cannot be ascertained (the name \r\nMartin was not continued in the American family), it would appear that Patrick1 \r\nKennedy's father was one of the two Patrick Kennedys in Dunganstown in 1824.&#160; \r\nThese latter may have been, but were not necessarily, father and son.&#160; Previous \r\nresearch [2] has determined that Patrick1 Kennedy had at least two older \r\nbrothers, John and James, born about 1809 and 1815 respectively; so their \r\nfather's approximate birth date is about 1785.&#160; Quite possibly this earlier \r\nPatrick (father of the immigrant, John and James) was Patrick Jr., aged almost \r\n40 in 1824, while his own father, perhaps Patrick Sr., was in his 60s or \r\n70s.</p>\r\n<p><em>Griffith's Valuation of Ireland, </em>completed for Dunganstown in 1853 \r\nbut probably compiled over several previous years, shows Patrick and John \r\nKennedy as householders.&#160; We assume that these were Patrick (born ca. 1785), \r\nfather of the immigrant Patrick1 who was already in America, and John (born ca. \r\n1809), his eldest son.&#160; Death records in Ireland began only in 1864, and no \r\nsearch in them has yet been undertaken for the senior Patrick Kennedy or his \r\nwife; nor have existing probate records been checked.&#160; But from Richard J. \r\nHayes, <em>Manuscript Sources for the History of Irish Civilisation </em>(1965), \r\nand from further correspondence with the National Library of Ireland, this \r\nwriter uncovered another potentially valuable source: estate records of the \r\nGlascott family, who held Whitechurch parish and much surrounding land from at \r\nleast 1756 onwards and were landlords of the Kennedys and other resident \r\nCatholic tenant families.</p>\r\n<p>The Glascott records are currently held by the National Library in off-site \r\nstorage and are not readily available for research.&#160; It is hoped that an Irish \r\ngenealogist will soon have access to them. Included are leases and deeds \r\n(1715-1848); rental records (1820-27 and 1830-42); and accounts (1826-71).&#160; Ian \r\nCantwell, an Irish researcher whose father, Brian Cantwell, has compiled several \r\nvolumes of co. Wexford tombstone [<strong>103</strong>] inscriptions, sent the \r\nfollowing inscriptions from Whitechurch yard (three headstones in one enclosed \r\nplot):</p>\r\n<p><em>Erected by James Kenedy in memory of his father John Kenedy of Dun \r\nganstown who depd this life 29 Octr 1803 agd 63 years also his wife Bridget \r\nKennedy alias Shallow depd 17th July 1774 aged 30 years.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Erected by John Kennedy in memory of his mother Mary Kennedy alias Cunnip \r\nof Dunganstown who died 30th Dec 1898 aged 85 years also his father John Kennedy \r\nwho died 24th March 1864 aged 55 years </em>[the interments of John (Jr.) and \r\nseveral brothers and sisters follow]</p>\r\n<p><em>Erected by Patrick Kennedy </em>[of <em>Dunganstown in memory of his \r\nfather James Kennedy who died 13th Feb 1881 aged 66 years also his mother \r\nCatherine Kennedy who died 10th Nov 1904 aged 85 years </em>[the interments of \r\nPatrick, three of his children and a sister follow].</p>\r\n<p>Almost certainly the above John Kennedy (ca. 1809-1864) and James Kennedy \r\n(ca. 1815-1881) were the older brothers of the immigrant Patrick1 Kennedy.&#160; \r\nUnfortunately no headstones were found for their presumed parents, Patrick and \r\nMary Johanna (___) Kennedy.&#160; The John Kenedy who was buried in 1803, aged 63, \r\n<em>might </em>have been the father of the older Patrick Kennedy in Dunganstown \r\nin 1824, father or grandfather of the younger Patrick Kennedy (b. ca. 1785, \r\nprobably also in Dunganstown in 1824), grandfather or great-grandfather of the \r\nthe immigrant Patrick1 Kennedy and great-great--great- or \r\ngreat-great-great-great-grandfather of the president.</p>\r\n<p>American research has uncovered several other families, probably from \r\nDunganstown, with whom the Kennedys were associated in Boston.&#160; Patrick1 \r\nKennedy's children were born in East Boston in the 1850s.&#160; Among the surnames of \r\ntheir baptismal sponsors Barron, Aspell and Maloy are quite common in southwest \r\nWexford, the Kennedys' homeland.&#160; A Patrick Barron (born ca. 1777, died Boston \r\n20 Sept. 1852) and wife Mary (Aspell) Barron (born ca. 1781, died Boston 30 Dec. \r\n1856) are first found in the 1850 Census of Ward 12, Boston.&#160; They had at least \r\nfour children James, born 1809, died after 1860, probably Boston; Thomas, born \r\n1813, died Boston 10 Nov. 1891; Patrick, born 1820, died Boston 6 July 1891; and \r\nJohanna, born ca. 1827, died Boston 23 June 1916.&#160; The naturalizations of James, \r\nThomas and Patrick Jr. all give co. Wexford as their place of origin.&#160; James, \r\nPatrick Jr. and Johanna were all living with their parents in the 1850 census.&#160; \r\nLiving with them was Nicholas Aspell, aged 40, also a sponsor to one of Patrick1 \r\nKennedy#s children, and adjoining the Barron household was that of a Francis \r\nKennedy, aged 25, with a wife and two small daughters.&#160; According to city \r\ndirectories and vital and census data the brothers James, Thomas and Patrick \r\nBarron, Jr., the probable cousins Nicholas and Richard Aspell, and both Francis \r\nand Patrick Kennedy were all employed as coopers.</p>\r\n<p>The Patrick Barron, Jr. noted above migrated to East Boston at about the same \r\ntime as the Kennedys, was one of two witnesses at Patrick Kennedy's 1849 \r\nwedding, and sponsored one of the Kennedy children.&#160; A close Barron-Kennedy \r\nconnection is likely, especially since the maiden name of Patrick Joseph2 \r\nKennedy's mother is mistakenly given as \"Barron\" on his 1928 death record (it \r\nwas actually Murphy).&#160; Possibly Mary Johanna (___)Kennedy, mother of the \r\nimmigrant Patrick1, was a sister of Patrick Barron, Sr.&#160; Boston vital records \r\nestablish that the latter's wife Mary was an Aspell, and Richard and Nicholas \r\nAspell (the latter b. ca. 1810), who were in Boston by the 1850s, were probably \r\nher nephews.&#160; Both Nicholas and Richard changed their surnames to Archibald (of \r\nwhich Aspell is a derivative) sometime in the 1860s.&#160; According to Boston vital \r\nrecords, Nicholas's parents were John and Bridget (Hanlon) Archibald, and \r\nRichard's were James and Mary (___) Archibald.&#160; Their kinship to the Kennedys, \r\nwhile probable, has not been proved.&#160; No Barrons nor Aspells appear in the 1824 \r\nTithe Applotment Book of Dunganstown, although several lived in Whitechurch and \r\nnearby parishes.</p>\r\n<p>A Patrick Maloy was sponsor to one of the Kennedy children in 1852, and \r\nseveral other Maloys were sponsors to children of Patrick Barron, Jr. in the \r\n1850s.&#160; Although incomplete, research thus far indicates that this Maloy family \r\nconsisted of at least four brothers -- George, Valentine, Patrick and William, \r\nborn between 1810 and 1825 -- sons of John and Ann (Grace) Maloy.&#160; At least \r\nthree of the brothers, residing in Dorchester in the 1840s, moved to East Boston \r\nin the 1850s. George Maloy's naturalization record states that he was from \r\n\"Suttons\" parish, co. Wexford, of which Whitechurch was part (see Samuel Lewis, \r\n<em>Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, </em>vol. 2 [1837, reprint 1984], p. \r\n181).&#160; The Tithe Applotment Book for Dunganstown shows James, John, William and \r\nWidow# Muloy, along with Michael and #Widow# Grace, as householders; the 1853 \r\nGriffith#s Valuation shows Patrick, John, Michael and Thomas Molloy as \r\nhouseholders there.&#160; No kinship of these Maloys/Mulloys to the Kennedys has yet \r\nbeen found.</p>\r\n<p>The writer is continuing research on the Kennedys and their connections, and \r\nwould welcome any further information.

Wexford: Further Ancestors of President John F. Kennedy", "content": "<p>&#160;Patrick Kennedy (1823-1858), an immigrant from Dunganstown, parish of\r\n Whitechurch, Co. Wexford, great-grandfather of the president and \r\nfounder of one of the major families in American political history, was \r\nfeatured in <em>NEXUS </em>7(1990):102-4; his descendants are \r\nauthoritatively covered in the <em>Register </em>139(1985):21 1-24 (repr. \r\nin <em>The Irish in New England </em>[NEHGS, 1985], pp. 25-38). Patrick \r\nmarried Bridget Murphy at Holy Cross Cathedral in Boston 26 September \r\n1849. There is no civil record for this marriage, and no ages or \r\nparents&#8217; names are given on the church register. Bridget&#8217;s death record \r\nin Boston, 20 December 1888, gives her age as 67 (probably an \r\nexaggeration), born in Ireland, daughter of Richard and Mary (___) \r\nMurphy <em>(Mass. VRs </em>393:427). Censuses (1855 through 1880) indicate\r\n a birthdate of ca. 1827. No American records indicate her exact place \r\nof birth, but family tradition claims Bridget also came from County \r\nWexford, where Murphy, the most common Irish surname, is widespread.\r\n </p>\r\n<p>Bridget&#8217;s presumed sister, Margaret Murphy, who lived with the \r\nKennedys, was born ca. 1832, married Patrick Cleary (another Wexford \r\nsurname) in East Boston 20 September 1857 and died there 3 October 1880 <em>(Mass.\r\n VRs </em>110:89,321:249). Her father is given as Richard on marriage and\r\n death records, and her mother as Mary on the death record. No other \r\nsiblings of Bridget have been found in the Boston area; nor have census,\r\n city directory, or death data been found for her parents, who probably \r\ndid not come to America.</p>\r\n <p>Among the godparents of the children \r\n(born in the 1850s) of Patrick and Bridget (Murphy) Kennedy were Patrick\r\n Barron, Johanna Barron, Nicholas Aspill and Bridget Aspil. The 1850 \r\ncensus of Ward 12, Boston (p. 268, family #587) shows Patrick &#8220;Barns,&#8221; \r\n75, with Mary, 72; James, 34; Patrick, 30; and Joanna, 20, with Nicholas\r\n Aspell, 40, also in the household. Patrick, Jr. and Nicholas were \r\nemployed as coopers (as was the immigrant Patrick Kennedy.) A Thomas \r\nBarron who lived in Boston from the 1840s to the 1890s has also been \r\nshown to be a son of Patrick and Mary. The senior Patrick Barron died in\r\n Boston 20 September 1852, aged 74 <em>(Mass. VRs </em>68:59), and Mary \r\nBarron died in Boston 30 December 1856, aged 75 (Mass. <em>VRs </em>104:76).\r\n No parents&#8217; names, nor Mary&#8217;s maiden name, are given in Patrick or \r\nMary&#8217;s death records; death records of her children Johanna and Thomas \r\ngive their mother&#8217;s name as Mary Aspell. Patrick and Mary (Aspell) \r\nBarron were probably born about 1778 and 1780, respectively; their \r\ndaughter Joanna may have been born closer to 1825 than 1830. Her death \r\nrecord in East Boston 23 June1916 <em>(Mass. VRs, Boston, 2:</em>49) gives\r\n her age as &#8220;89?&#8221;.</p>\r\n <p>No connection was found in American or Irish \r\nrecords between Patrick Kennedy and the Barrons or Aspells, so some \r\nkinship between the latter and Bridget (Murphy) Kennedy seemed likely. \r\nMoreover the death record of Bridget&#8217;s son Patrick Joseph Kennedy, in \r\nBoston <em>(VR </em>1929:1:414), gave his mother&#8217;s maiden name as Bridget <em>Barron,\r\n </em>not Murphy, a very suggestive error. It is highly probable that \r\nPatrick and Mary (Aspell) Barron were either the maternal grandparents \r\nof Bridget (Murphy) Kennedy or her aunt and uncle. If the former, \r\nBridget&#8217;s mother Mary (Barron) Murphy would have been born ca. 1800-5 \r\nand married Richard Murphy probably by 1825.</p>\r\n <p>Naturalization \r\nrecords have been found for Patrick Barron, Jr. and James Barron, as \r\nwell as for a third brother, Thomas Barron. Nicholas Aspell&#8217;s \r\nnaturalization, and post-1850 records of him, were all found under the \r\nsurname Archibald (a derivative of Aspell, a name exclusive to Co. \r\nWexford). James Barron, born 20 October 1809, arrived in Boston 14 July \r\n1839; Thomas Barron, born 15 June 1813, arrived in Boston 7(?) November \r\n1839; Patrick Barron, born 24 December 1820, arrived in Boston 3 \r\nDecember 1848; and Nicholas Archibald, born 24 December 1817, arrived in\r\n Boston 9 June 1834. All four were born in Co. Wexford, Ireland (U.S. \r\nCircuit Court 13:263; U.s. Circuit Court 4:561; U.S. District Court \r\n18:173; U.S. District Court 123:186; all at Boston).</p>\r\n <p>Nicholas \r\nAspell/Archibald was apparently a widower by 1850; he had at least one \r\ndaughter, Bridget (Archibald) Hickey (ca. 1840-1894) whose death record \r\ngives her mother as Ann Hanlon <em>(Mass. VRs </em>447:398). The 1860 \r\ncensus of Boston Ward 7 (p. 223) shows the family of James Barron, aged \r\n51, with several boarders in the household including Nicholas Asbel, a \r\ncooper, aged 55. Nicholas himself died in Boston 17 March 1891 <em>(Mass.\r\n VRs </em>420:88), aged 84, son of John and Bridget (Hanlon) Archibald. \r\nAn Edward Barron who witnessed Thomas Barron&#8217;s 1851 naturalization was \r\nalso probably related. Edward&#8217;s naturalization, at Boston 23 October \r\n1840, gives his birthplace as Tintrine (Tintern), County of Wexford, \r\nIreland 15 April 1797; he arrived at Boston 10 December 1824 (Municipal \r\nCourt, Suffolk Co., 2182, vol. 28,1840). In the 1844 Boston city \r\ndirectory Edward Barren (a ship-wright) and Thomas Barren (a cooper) \r\nboth lived at Gold Street between D and E Streets. By the late 1840s \r\nEdward and Patrick Barron lived on Atkinson Street in South Boston. On \r\n21 October 1853 Edward Barron, carpenter, [<strong>24</strong>] aged 52, married \r\n(as his second wile) Hannah Desmond at Boston <em>(VRs </em>71:148). \r\nEdward Barron, Jr. was most likely a nephew of the senior Patrick \r\nBarron.</p>\r\n <p>A search of the Tithe Applotrnent Books (the Irish \r\nhouseholder survey of the 1820s) was made for Murphy, Barron and Aspell \r\nfamilies for Tintern and nearby Co. Wexford parishes. A close match was \r\nfound in the townland of Cloonagh, Parish of Owenduff, where Richard \r\nMurphy and Patrick Barren had adjoining holdings in 1833 of 16 and 17 \r\nacres (Tithe Applotment Book, Parish of Owenduff, p. 12). Also in \r\nCloonagh were Thomas and Patrick Aspill. <em>Griffith&#8217;s Valuation of \r\nIreland, </em>taken in 1854, finds no Patrick Barron (consistent with \r\nemigration to Boston), but Richard Murphy still in Cloonagh with 16 \r\nacres, along with Patrick, Nicholas and Thomas Archbold. The Tithe Books\r\n also show a John Aspill in nearby Rathumney.</p>\r\n <p>The parish of \r\nOwenduff, Barony of Shelburne, Co. Wexford is served by the Catholic \r\nparish of Ballycullane (Tintern) whose baptismal register dates from \r\n1827. The Wexford County Library staff searched it for all Murphy, \r\nBarron and Aspell data through the 1850s and found the following:</p>\r\n <p>18\r\n May 1831, <em>baptism </em>of Edward Murphy <em>(parents: </em>Richard \r\nMurphy, Mary Barron; <em>sponsors: </em>James Dunn, Mary Scot; <em>townland:\r\n </em>not listed)</p>\r\n <p>18 Nov. 1835 (b. 16 Nov.) <em>baptism </em>of \r\nBrigid Aspel <em>(parents: </em>Nicholas Aspel, Ann Hanlon; <em>sponsors: </em>D.\r\n Dunn, Brigid Hanlon; <em>townland: </em>Nash)</p>\r\n <p>No baptisms were \r\nfound for Bridget or Margaret Murphy, but it seems almost certain that \r\nthe Edward Banon above was their brother and that the parents of Bridget\r\n (Murphy) Kennedy were Richard and Mary (Barron) Murphy of Cloonagh. \r\nThis townland is only a few miles east of Dunganstown, Patrick Kennedy&#8217;s\r\n birthplace and now the site of Kennedy Park. Further search in the \r\nregisters (dating from 1778) of Cushinstown, one parish north, may \r\nreveal more Barron and Aspell data.</p>\r\n <p>Brian J. Cantwell, <em>Memorials\r\n of the Dead, </em>vol.7, covering southwest Wexford, does not transcribe\r\n tombstone inscriptions for Richard Murphy&#8217;s or Patrick Barron&#8217;s \r\nfamilies<em>, </em>but the following in Owenduff parish are of interest:</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;Erected by Thomas Aspel of Ramsgrange in memory of his father James\r\n Aspel who died 9 September 1858 aged 79, also his mother Bridget Aspel \r\nwho died 10 February</p>\r\n <p><em>1862 aged 78.&#8221;</em></p>\r\n <p><em>&#8220;Laurence \r\nBarron of Rathemney </em>[listed under Nash townland] <em>for his wife \r\nBridget Barron alias Aspel who died 8 November 1835, aged 55.&#8221;</em></p>\r\n <p>There\r\n are other mid-1800s Barron inscriptions in Owenduff, and an ancient \r\nArchbold tombstone in Rathumney.</p>\r\n <p>It may be difficult to connect \r\nRichard Murphy, with his common surname, to others in and around \r\nOwenduff. The name &#8220;Barron&#8221; is of great antiquity in this area and \r\naccording to MacLysaght&#8217;s <em>Irish Families </em>descends froma branch of\r\n the FitzGeralds whose head was known as the Palatine baron of \r\nBurnchurch in the fourteenth century. <em>Burke&#8217;s Irish Family Records </em>includes\r\n the Barrons (Fitzgerald) of Burnchurch, but does not cover the Killesk \r\nbranch, who were probably the president&#8217;s ancestors. A list of knights&#8217; \r\nfees of 1307, found in Kevin Whelan, ed., <em>Wexford</em>: <em>History and\r\n Society </em>(1987), p. 99, shows the Barrons (FitzGeralds) holding \r\nlands in Killesk parish, next to Owenduff; Barrons (FitzGeralds) still \r\nheld land there in 1640, as per the Civil Survey of Ireland. W.P.W. \r\nPhillimore [and Gertrude Thrift], <em>Indexes to Irish Wills, </em>vol. 1 \r\n(1909, repr. 1970), p. 64, includes the will (proved in 1630 in the \r\ndiocese of Ferns) of a Pierce Barron of Tolleraght (Tellarought), just \r\nnorth of Owenduff and Killesk. The index to Ferns admin. bonds \r\n(unpublished, at the Public Record Office, Dublin) includes a Patrick \r\nBarron of Carnross in 1794. Much of the area, including Owendulf parish,\r\n belonged to the Coldough family of Tintern; most of their estate \r\nrecords including a 1755-57 rent roll which could list earlier ancestors\r\n of the president <em>- </em>are still in private custody <em>(Analectica \r\nHibernica </em>m. 20 [1958]: Colclough Papers, relating to lands in Co. \r\nWexford from 1538; also National Library of Ireland report on private \r\ncollections, m. 124).</p>\r\n <p><em>Richard Andrew Pierce, a professional \r\ngenealogist in Boston, specializes in Irish and nineteenth-century \r\nresearch and works with the NEHGS Enquiries Service.

They \r\nprovide a fascinating look at events that occurred many years ago \r\nwritten by a person who had lived through them. Many diaries identify \r\nfamily members or at least give clues about their identity. \r\nAdditionally, diaries often contain the answers to elusive questions \r\nabout a birth, death, or marriage. Many diaries, however, only cover a \r\nvery short period of time, which limits their ability to provide a \r\nbroad-based, detailed look into the window of years past. </p>\r\n <p>Margaret\r\n (Lord) Varnum (1806-1885) was born in Brooksville, Maine November 18, \r\n1806, the daughter of Capt John and Olive (Stover) Lord. She was married\r\n at Brooksville in February 1831 to David Farnham, Jr. (recorded as \r\nVarnum in town records). Margaret was a deeply religious person who \r\nattended church on the Sabbath without failure, and she constantly \r\nprayed for family, friends, and neighbors. </p>\r\n <p>Commencing December \r\n1, 1852, Margaret began to record her thoughts of current events around \r\nher community and the country in her diary. It would span more than 32 \r\nyears, during which she told of disease and epidemics, recounted \r\nshipwrecks, and recorded her reactions of the Civil War and the \r\nassassination of Abraham Lincoln. She made it a practice to attend the \r\nfunerals of people in her community, and soon began recording these \r\nevents in her diary. </p>\r\n <p>Margaret often noted the manner in which a \r\nperson died, and days later would describe her innermost thoughts and \r\nfeelings after attending the funeral. She wrote of children who died of \r\nwhooping cough, croup, scarlet fever, and from burns when clothing \r\ncaught fire. One child died when a bean caught in his throat. Another \r\nstuck a knitting needle up his nose and died from the injuries. </p>\r\n <p>She\r\n wrote that Mrs. Fanny Wasson, who had been \"deranged but [able] to do \r\nher work and been to meeting,\" committed suicide (recorded February 21, \r\n1868) by hanging herself with a skein of yarn. She stated Mrs. Wasson \r\nhad \"left a kind husband and 8 brothers and their wives and a dear \r\nMother,\" and had left \"4 brothers away to sea.\" She described Mrs. \r\nWasson's final moments: </p>\r\n <blockquote> <p>\"She washed her floars and \r\ngot her dinner on and her husband went out for a Short time. as She \r\napered more deranged he had not left her alone long at a time. when he \r\ncame in the house he found She was not there but all things were doing \r\nwell but he went up Stairs and what an awful sight he Saw his dear wife \r\nhung and dead. He Caught her in his arms and brought her down Stairs and\r\n tried to do Something for her but Could not. Her life was Just gone.\" </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Brooksville Historical Society (BHS) had the entire diary \r\ntranscribed in the 1930s. A typescript copy done in 1977 by volunteers \r\nof the BHS is now available in their collection. Attempts to locate the \r\noriginal diary have been unsuccessful, but an undated news article \r\nreported it to have been \"rescued from the partition between two walls.\"\r\n </p>\r\n <p>Researchers of the Penobscot region will find the entries to be\r\n of particular interest.

A week earlier she had penned \r\nremarks that his vessel, the Mary Perce, was \"seen bottom up nere \r\nChatham and nothing seen of the crew\" that included her \"dear Francis,\" \r\nand wondered if her \"boy [was] gone\". </p>\r\n <blockquote> <p><em>Sep 23, \r\n1860: One wek to day Since I wrote with a heavy heart&#8230;.last Monday how \r\nwe were about our dear Child.

It was the scene of Revolutionary War \r\nland and sea battles. Tradition has it that the first settlers were \r\nArchibald Hainey, Timothy Roax, and Ebenezer Leland.<br><br>The town of \r\nBrooksville, named for the first governor of Maine, was incorporated in \r\n1817. It is almost entirely surrounded by water: on the east and north \r\nby Walkers Pond, Bagaduce River, and Castine Harbor; to the south by \r\nEggemoggin Reach; and to the west by Penobscot Bay. In the nineteenth \r\ncentury there were five villages of Brooksville: Brooksville; North \r\nBrooksville, West Brooksville, Cape Rosier; and South Brooksville. \"The \r\nCape\" was named for James Rosier (Rozier), the cartographer on the \r\nexpedition of Capt. Weymouth, who sailed up the Penobscot in the \r\nseventeenth century.<br><br>Brooksville has not forgotten its past. With\r\n the passage of time, the town fathers saw a need to preserve and \r\nmaintain the things we all cherish: the written word of families, the \r\nlifestyle, the artifacts, and anything else that reminds us of the \r\ngolden days. And the peaceful and pleasant atmosphere of the Penobscot \r\nBay region, as seen by the eyes of the craftsmen -- blacksmiths, \r\nfarmers, mariners, ships carpenters, and so on -- is well preserved. The\r\n townspeople have been ever mindful of the lifestyle and sacrifices made\r\n by their forefathers. The Brooksville Historical Society (BHS) was \r\norganized in the early 1930s with the goal of preserving much of the \r\narea's rich traditions. It has survived over the years and today remains\r\n a small organization, staffed essentially by volunteers. Richard \r\nBrownell, Archivist, and his associates have compiled an array of \r\nmemorabilia and artifacts donated by families that is intended to show \r\nthe heritage of the Brooksville area and its population.

A\r\n deeply religious woman, Margaret Varnum (who died on 3 January 1885) \r\nrecorded many events that, in some instances, are at odds with published\r\n vital statistics. She also made note of specific reasons for the deaths\r\n of many of her neighbors. Again, this is information that may not be \r\nfound elsewhere. Her diary is 220 pages long, and the last 10 pages of \r\nthis edition contain an alphabetical listing of all of the deaths, \r\napproximately 400 persons, in these coastal towns. The deaths were \r\nextracted and published in volumes 17 and 128 of the <em>Maine \r\nGenealogist</em> (1995-96). The following are typical of her diary \r\nentries:<br><br><em>April 18 1862: death has again Come into our town Mrs\r\n Hyrum orcut died this week of the quick Consumption She has left her \r\nhusband and a infant Child and friends to mourn Just in her youthful \r\ndays She lives in the distant part of the Town So I dont know the \r\nparticulars<br><br>Feb 16 1862: I hav now to record the death of little \r\nFlora Maddocks one of my daughters litte twins 3 years old her Cloths \r\ncaught fir and was was burnt badly but she inhaled the fire and She \r\nlived only a days She was a lovely child but She has gone to that \r\nbutiful world wher ther will be no more death [more]<br><br>Oct 19 1862:\r\n Ruba Varnum my Sister in law lost her dear little babe he died in my \r\narms he has gone to Join that happy Company of holy Children god bless \r\nthose parents and may it prove a blessing to them and may they be led to\r\n Say thy will be done.</em> </p>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/genealogical-research-in-brooksville/", "published": "", "id": 217}, {"author": "Russell C.

In my \r\nview, only nearby Essex County, Massachusetts, compares in size (though \r\nit is smaller) and influence. York County was originally called \r\nYorkshire County (1658 to 1691), when Massachusetts assumed \r\njurisdiction. It was part of Massachusetts from its inception, on 20 \r\nNovember 1652, until it became Maine's largest county in 1820. The \r\namount of archival material available to the researcher is far reaching \r\nand instantly brings to mind such storied names as Savage, Frost, \r\nChamberlain, Noyes, Libby, Davis, and other genealogists who left their \r\nmark in this field. As in my earlier column, I wish to concentrate here \r\non identifying the many broad-based titles that are consistently used in\r\n Maine research, identify the better known private and public \r\nrepositories in York County, and describe, in narrative form, the \r\nholdings of these government, public, and private locations.</p>\r\n<p>Cities\r\n and towns under the jurisdiction of York County are Acton, Alfred, \r\nArundel, *Berwick, Buxton, *Biddeford, Cornish, Dayton, *Eliot, Hollis, \r\nKennebunk, Kennebunkport, *Kittery, *Lebanon, *Limerick, Limington, \r\nLyman, Newfield, *North Berwick, Ogunquit, Old Orchard Beach, \r\nParsonsfield, *Saco, Sanford, Shapleigh, *South Berwick, Waterboro, \r\nWells, and *York<sup>1</sup>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Probate and Court Records</strong><br>York\r\n County offers the researcher the opportunity to work with what is \r\nprobably -- in this writer's view -- the most cooperative probate court \r\nin New England. Housed on the second floor of the courthouse in Alfred \r\n(45 Kennebunk Road), the staff are polite, courteous, and willing to \r\nshow researchers how to navigate their resources. Like any court staff, \r\nthey rely on the genealogist's own ability to determine what is needed. \r\nThey will help you locate items then leave you on your own to browse and\r\n explore. The registrar's office is open Monday through Friday, \r\n8:30-4:30.</p>\r\n<p>Indexes (where would we be without them!) take many \r\ndifferent forms. In York, the indexes to probate estates are \r\nalphabetically arranged 3 x 5 card files, covering the period 1687-1900.\r\n Indexes for the period from 1900 to date are recorded in red ledgers, \r\nand actual docket files from 1981 to present are housed in folders. \r\nAccess to post-1981 dockets are controlled by staff, who will secure a \r\nsingle docket at a time.</p>\r\n<p>The 3 x 5 cards and ledgers contain the \r\nname of the estate, type of estate (i.e., will, petitions for \r\nadministration, bond, inventory and so on), and the docket number. The \r\ncross-reference to the docket will direct the researcher to rows of \r\ncabinets containing the actual vertical docket jackets. The original \r\npetitions, wills, guardian orders and other probate documents are housed\r\n in \"jackets,\" and because of their age, must be carefully handled, \r\nrefolded, and returned to their proper jacket. I find it thrilling to \r\nhold in my hands a letter or petition signed 200 or 300 years ago by an \r\nancestor, able to examine the writing style, signatures, and other \r\nmarks.</p>\r\n<p>Copies of probate documents are made by staff, and cost $1\r\n per page. Requests for copies of estates may be directed to Keith R \r\nPatterson, Registrar of Probate, PO Box 399, Alfred, Maine 04002. \r\nRequests must be specific and should include a self-addressed, stamped \r\nenvelope. The court will not copy any estate documents until funds are \r\nprovided in advance.</p>\r\n<p>The early probate and court records of York \r\nCounty have been published, and are contained in several books: </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li><em>Maine Wills, 1640-1760</em>, by William M Sargent \r\n(Portland, Me., 1887; reprint, Baltimore, Md., 1972).  </li>\r\n<li>John \r\nFrost, <em>Maine Probate Abstracts</em>, vol. 1, 1687-1775, vol. 2, \r\n1775-1800 (Picton Press: Camden, Maine, 1991). This monumental \r\ntwo-volume set consists mostly of York County, but includes also \r\nWashington and Hancock County probate records (1789-1800). Frost notes \r\nthat it is \"loosely called Maine Probate Abstracts since it comprises \r\nabstracts of all records of the Probate Courts of Maine, whether wills, \r\nadministrations, estate divisions, estate accounts, guardianships or \r\nother acts. Probate by strict definition refers only to the proving of a\r\n will, and administration to the administering of an estate whether the \r\nperson is testate or intestate.\" It is accessible in most repositories \r\nthat contain good genealogical collections and was the first book I \r\npurchased for my own library.  </li>\r\n<li>Joseph C. Anderson II, <em>York \r\nCounty, Maine Will Abstracts, 1801-1858</em>, 2 vols. (Picton Press, \r\nCamden, Maine 1997). These recently published volumes, though they \r\nrecord only estates documented by wills, continue John Frost's work. \r\nThey cover an amazing 57 years and typically represent the first-class \r\nwork we have come to expect of the author. At the beginning of the first\r\n volume is an alphabetical list of each testator, showing the town of \r\nresidence, the year the estate reached probate court, and a will \r\nnumber--this reflects the order in which the original will was recorded \r\nin the probate court volumes.  </li>\r\n<li>Finally, there is the \r\nmultivolume work by the Maine Historical Society, <em>Province and Court \r\nRecords of Maine</em> (Portland, Me., 1928-1975). These six volumes \r\ncontain abstracts of York County Superior Court proceedings, 1639-1727. \r\nMost early surnames appear in these volumes as plaintiff, judge, \r\njuryman, or witness. Searching these volumes is a must for research on \r\n17th- or 18th-century ancestors.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><strong>York County Deeds</strong><br>The\r\n years 1642-1737 represent the only time frame that deed records in \r\nAmerica have been published, yet the herculean task of transcribing \r\nalmost one hundred years of deeds remains mind-boggling. To my \r\nknowledge, no other county, and no organization, government or private, \r\nhas reached the high level of achievement represented by York Deeds \r\n(Portland, Me., 1887-1910). These rare volumes (18 in 19) will only be \r\nfound in repositories with a good genealogical collection. The volumes \r\ncontain a complete transcription of these very early York deeds, with an\r\n alphabetical grantor-grantee index.</p>\r\n<p>The York County Registrar of\r\n Deeds is a very busy office. Indexes from 1738 into this century are \r\ncontained in large ledgers, organized by date. Current deeds (1965 to \r\npresent) are also indexed and stored in computers. Genealogical \r\nresearchers need to have a good idea of the timeframe they are \r\ninterested in before consulting indexes in order to obtain the deed \r\nnumber. The actual transcribed copies of deeds are contained in the same\r\n heavy ledgers. Desk space is provided for researchers to use while \r\nsearching these ledgers. Deeds are filed by book and pages and are \r\ncommonly referred to thusly: 36:455 (book 36, page 455).</p>\r\n<p>The \r\noffice staff does not do genealogical research but will provide a list \r\nof local genealogical researchers who may be consulted. Requests for \r\ncopies of specific deeds may be forwarded to Lois Muse, Registrar of \r\nDeeds, PO Box 339, Alfred, ME 04002 (tel: 1-207-324-1576). Copies are \r\n$1.25 per page, and funds must be sent in advance. The hours at the York\r\n County Registrar of Deeds office are 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday through\r\n Friday.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Early Congregational Churches in York County</strong><br>Church\r\n records are a valuable but underused source of genealogical \r\ninformation. Unlike civil records, which are usually found at \r\ncourthouses or town offices, the location of church records is not \r\nalways obvious. It is worth the trouble to find them, though, as church \r\nrecords may fill in gaps left by other primary sources. Oftentimes \r\nchurch baptisms are the only source of information that directly links a\r\n child to his or her parents.</p>\r\n<p>In Maine, numerous churches, mostly\r\n Congregational, were established in the colonial period. A list of the \r\nYork County churches follows. For each is given the date of \r\norganization, the location of the original church records, if known, and\r\n the location of any transcript of church records<sup>2</sup>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>York\r\n 1st Parish, 1673</strong><br>Originals: The earliest records were lost in \r\nthe Indian massacre of 1692.

There\r\n are many \"faces\" worthy of repeating, but owing to space restrictions \r\ngreater detail can be found in my book, <em>A Longfellow Genealogy</em>. \r\nIt is the first published opus of the family. </p>\r\n<p><strong>William the Immigrant</strong><br>It was the immigrant William, of \r\nNewbury, Massachusetts, who set the litigious tone for the family, by \r\nvirtue of consistent court appearances in Essex County. <sup>1</sup> He \r\nenjoyed his spirits at the Blue Anchor tavern in Newbury, where he had \r\nacquired a reputation as one who took his time when it came to paying \r\nhis tavern bill. His father-in-law, Henry Sewall, spent upwards of \"a \r\nhundred pounds\" to get him out of debt, and William also approached the \r\nSewall family to pay his passage to England when it became necessary to \r\nreturn there in 1687, a result of his brother Nathan's death. William \r\nwas hopeful he would receive his \"patrimony\" from Nathan's estate. \r\nHowever, an uncle [a son of William's grandfather, Henry Sewall] in \r\nEngland apparently agreed to pay the passage, but only if his niece \r\nAnne, wife of William, agreed. William's father-in-law, Henry Sewall, \r\nback in Newbury, urged him to get what was to come to him through the \r\nestate process, and not become involved in frivolous lawsuits that would\r\n only end up wasting his money. </p>\r\n<p><strong>William the Second </strong><br>From William<sup>1</sup> was spun the \r\nsecond William<sup>2</sup>, who has been offered [erroneously] as \r\nprogenitor of the Maryland Longfellows.<sup>2</sup> That could not be, \r\nas William married Mary Davis in Charlestown, Massachusetts in 1705, and\r\n they left no issue. Therefore he could not have been father of Joseph, \r\nwhose earliest appearance in Maryland is 1710, when he witnessed the \r\nwill of Elizabeth Browne. There is now however definite proof of two \r\nprogenitors of the Longfellow name in America. There is currently no \r\nproof of the English link between the two families, although more \r\nresearch needs to be done in English archives.<br><br>It was Stephen<sup>2</sup>,\r\n the Newbury blacksmith and younger sibling of the second William<sup>2</sup>,\r\n who would later marry Abigail Thompson. They were \r\ngreat-great-grandparents of the poet, Henry<sup>6</sup> Wadsworth \r\nLongfellow (HWL). Stephen was the first of four consecutive Stephens in \r\nthe poet's line back to the immigrant. HWL would later pen the poem \"<a href=\"http://www.newenglandancestors.org/research/services/articles_longfellows_maine.asp\" target=\"_blank\">The Village Blacksmith</a>,\" as a tribute to his \r\ngreat-great-grandfather.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stephen Longfellow<sup>5</sup> and the Wadsworth Sisters</strong><br>Zilpah\r\n Wadsworth was the daughter of the famous Revolutionary War patriot, \r\nGeneral Peleg Wadsworth and Elizabeth Bartlett, formerly of Duxbury, \r\nMassachusetts. Zilpah's sister Elizabeth had caught the eye of one \r\nStephen<sup>5</sup> Longfellow, noted Portland attorney, congressman, \r\nand respected citizen of Falmouth (Portland). Tragically, Elizabeth \r\nwould succumb to her death from consumption on August 1, 1802. Zilpah \r\nwas devoted to caring for her younger sister, who required drinking and \r\nsoaking in solutions of potash. <sup>3</sup> On her deathbed, Stephen \r\nLongfellow held her hand until long after she expired, as members of her\r\n family watched. </p>\r\n<p>After Eliza Wadsworth was buried, Stephen Longfellow, father of the \r\npoet, remarked to Zilpah and her sister Lucia: \"You will still be my \r\nsisters.\"<sup>4</sup> As events unfolded, it was Zilpah, who Stephen \r\nwould marry [in the same room that Elizabeth had died]. Younger sister \r\nLucia Wadsworth, who was seven years younger than Stephen Longfellow, \r\nwould spend her life caring for their children, perhaps because of her \r\naffection and desire to be close to him. Lucia would tend to the many \r\nchores of keeping house at Portland for Stephen and Zilpah. She \"ran the\r\n house, cooking, sewing, knitting, and in general managing the entire \r\nfamily.\" <sup>5</sup> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Nathan Longfellow<sup>2</sup> </strong><br>The second William<sup>2</sup>\r\n had a brother Nathan<sup>2</sup>, who would marry Mary Green. Nathan<sup>2</sup>\r\n would continue his father's legal habits by often going to the Common \r\nPlea Court, held at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to settle differences \r\nwith siblings, neighbors, and friends. His wife Mary was the daughter of\r\n the respected Judge (Capt.) Jacob Green of Hampton Falls and his wife \r\nSarah, the earliest owners of the mills at Hampton Falls. The mills \r\nwould burn, but were rebuilt by Capt. Jacob despite the objections of \r\nNathaniel Weare, who operated a mill further up the Falls River. When \r\nNathan<sup>2</sup> died, leaving an estate of &#163;2,630, his widow Mary \r\nmarried Joseph Macress of Salisbury. This marriage led to more legal \r\nskirmishes in the Portsmouth court that would not be resolved among this\r\n family for many years. The nine children of Nathan and Mary (Green) \r\nLongfellow were:<sup>6</sup> </p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">Jonathan, born May 23, 1714<br>Samuel, born May 8, \r\n1716<br>Ann, born August 2, 1719<br>Mehitable, born December 18, 1720<br>Jacob,\r\n born July 20, 1722<br>Sewall, born October 6, 1724<br>Abigail, born \r\nFebruary 5, 1727<br>Nathan, born June 8, 1729<br>Green, born April 3, \r\n1731<br></p>\r\nThe repetition of the given name \"Green\" found in later \r\nLongfellow families can be traced back to Nathan's wife Mary. The name, \r\nwhich was also frequently used by families of Palermo and Kennebec \r\ncounties, was popular until about the mid-nineteenth century. It was \r\nfrom Nathan<sup>2</sup> that the progenitors of the Longfellow name in \r\nMaine would spring. \r\n<p><strong>Jonathan Longfellow<sup>3</sup></strong><br>Nathan's oldest son \r\nJonathan3was the judge of the first court in Machias, Maine. From him \r\nwould come the largest Longfellow settlement (Machias) of the colonial \r\nera. Jonathan was a young man of seventeen when he married Mercy Clark, \r\nwho was age sixteen. Both grandparents of Jonathan and Mercy would lose \r\ntheir lives on the disastrous expedition to Quebec led by Sir William \r\nPhips in 1690. Although Jonathan was wealthy, he frequently ignored \r\ncreditors and refused to pay his own promissory notes. He was assaulted \r\non several occasions and participated in a flurry of litigation \r\nunsurpassed in Longfellow history. It took twenty-two years to settle \r\nhis estate. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Nathan Longfellow<sup>3</sup></strong><br>Jonathan's brother Nathan<sup>3</sup>\r\n also spent his early years at the Hampton Falls settlement of New \r\nHampshire. It is not certain when he departed from the area, but it may \r\nvery well have been the same time his older brother Jonathan<sup>3</sup>\r\n left for Cornwallis in 1764. Nathan<sup>3</sup> was a resident of \r\nLincoln County, Maine in 1776 when he served in Colonel Poor's New \r\nHampshire Regiment. <sup>7</sup> He married Susanah Healey about 1749 \r\nand they had eleven children, seven of which were born in Hampton Falls,\r\n New Hampshire. The remaining four children were born in Whitefield, \r\nLincoln County, Maine. Nathan's seven sons, Stephen<sup>4</sup>, Samuel<sup>4</sup>,\r\n Sewall<sup>4</sup>, Jacob<sup>4</sup>, Nathan<sup>4</sup>, Green<sup>4</sup>,\r\n Levi<sup>4</sup>, and daughter (Sarah) would settle in Maine, and leave\r\n large families. Another daughter, Betsy, remained in New Hampshire \r\nhaving married Joseph Wadleigh 3d. The sons would settle at Great Pond \r\n(Palermo, Waldo County) and Hunts Meadow (Whitefield, Lincoln County). \r\nThe Hunts Meadow settlement was on the western edge of what is now known\r\n as Whitefield. The first settlers of Hunts Meadow were Silas Hunt, the \r\nAbraham Preble family, and Sewall Longfellow. It was named after Silas \r\nHunt, the brother of Benoni, who was married to Sewall's sister Nancy. <sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<p>The Whitefield settlement got its name from the British evangelist \r\nGeorge Whitefield, who inspired the colonists before the town was \r\nsettled in 1770. <sup>9</sup> The early settlement was in the parish of \r\nSaint Denis, located on a hill in the Irish section of town, an area \r\nreminiscent of the countryside of Ireland. Headstones tell of origins in\r\n the Emerald Isle. <sup>10</sup> Jonathan and Levi Longfellow lived \r\nthere in 1803 on lots 19 and 20. Sewall was at Ballstown (Jefferson) at \r\nthe time of the 1800 census with Nathan and Nathan Longfellow Jr., and \r\nJacob. In 1810 Green, Levi, Nathan, Nathan Jr., and Samuel Longfellow \r\nwere also living there. </p>\r\n<p>The fertile and wooded river valley provided sustenance and energy to\r\n woodsmen, farmers, millers, sawyers, and their families for decades. \r\nThose who plied their trade and practiced their craft were thankful for \r\nthe power and beauty of the Sheepscot River. The Longfellows lived in \r\nthe same general region. They built homes for their families while \r\nfishing, hunting game, and growing wheat and corn. Levi, Stephen, and \r\nSamuel were part of the Sheepscut [sic] Great Pond land settlement that \r\nsplit as part of the Kennebec Purchase from the late colony of New \r\nPlymouth of 1802-1803. They were among the families who were \"quieted\" \r\nand granted possession of 100 acres of land. <sup>11</sup> </p>\r\n<p>Much more detail can be found in my book, <em>A Longfellow Genealogy, \r\ncomprising the English ancestry and descendants of the Immigrant, \r\nWilliam Longfellow of Newbury, Massachusetts and Henry Wadsworth \r\nLongfellow</em> (WALRUS Publishers, Inverness, FL, 2002). </p>\r\n<sup>1.</sup>Russell\r\n Clare Farnham, CG <em>A Longfellow Genealogy, Comprising the English \r\nAncestry and Descendants of the Immigrant, William Longfellow of \r\nNewbury, Massachusetts and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</em> (WALRUS \r\nPublishers, Inverness, Florida, 2002):47-55.<br><sup>2. </sup>Ibid; \r\nArticle, \"The Longfellows of Maryland: Were They Cousins of Those of \r\nMaine?\" <em>The Maine Genealogist</em> 22 [Feb 2000]:1:31-36.<br><sup>3.</sup>\"Longfellow's\r\n Portland and Portland's Longfellow,\" <em>Maine Historical Society \r\nQuarterly</em>, 14[1987]:<br><sup>4.</sup> Ibid, pg 4.<br><sup>5.</sup> \r\nIbid, pg 27.<br><sup>6.</sup> Russell Clare Farnham, CG <em>A Longfellow \r\nGenealogy, Comprising the English Ancestry and Descendants of the \r\nImmigrant, William Longfellow of Newbury, Massachusetts and Henry \r\nWadsworth Longfellow</em> : 47-55.<br><sup>7. </sup>Nathan was about age \r\n45 [sic] when he appears on a roll of the sick, who were absent from Col\r\n Poor's Regt from January 1, 1776 - July 1776 as shown in Isaac W. \r\nHammond, A.M., <em>The State of New Hampshire Rolls of the Soldiers in \r\nthe Revolutionary War, 1775, to May, 1777 with an Appendix, embracing \r\ndiaries of Lieut.

Others may have a \r\nmore abiding interest in learning of the battles and units that the \r\nindividuals served in, exactly where they took place, the strategy, the \r\nsickness, the traveling, the heroes, and most important, the detail that\r\n lays it all out (known in this business as the source).

Men below the rank of \r\ncommissioned officer were not accepted if they were above forty-five or \r\nunder eighteen years of age, or if they were not in good physical \r\nhealth. Interestingly, the order also stipulated \"When practicable, you \r\nwill detail a commissioned or non-commissioned officer to drill, \r\ndiscipline and instruct such recruits.\" <sup>1</sup>The very broad \r\nwording of this order supports the urgent atmosphere and the popular \r\nnotion that the majority of the soldiers left their farms, businesses, \r\nand families to serve with only the most limited training to prepare \r\nthem for war. </p>\r\n<p>The following represents the staff of the 1st Regiment, Maine \r\nVolunteers: <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">Nathaniel J.

The \r\nfollowing are selected excerpts: <sup>3</sup></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Private Jeremiah C. Gilman, age 20, was of Milo, single, and was \r\nmustered into service 28 May 1861, in Company D, 2nd Inf.

Millett, age \r\n43, married, also of Milo who was discharged 4 Oct with a disability. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition to the published volumes relating to the service of \r\nindividuals, there are other military records that can provide still \r\nfurther information about our ancestors. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Compiled Military Service Records</strong>: Each individual who served \r\nduring the Civil War had a Compiled Military Service Record (CMSR) for \r\neach regiment in which he served. The Civil War section of the National \r\nArchives website describes it in detail: \"The CMSR contains basic \r\ninformation about the soldier's military career, and it is the first \r\nsource the researcher should consult. The CMSR is an envelope (a jacket)\r\n containing one or more cards. These cards typically indicate that the \r\nsoldier was present or absent during a certain period of time. Other \r\ncards may indicate the date of enlistment and discharge, amount of \r\nbounty paid him, and other information such as wounds received during \r\nbattle or hospitalization for injury or illness. The soldier's place of \r\nbirth may be indicated; if foreign born, only the country is stated. The\r\n CMSR may contain an internal jacket for so-called 'personal papers' of \r\nvarious kinds. [Note] however that the CMSR rarely indicates battles in \r\nwhich a soldier fought; that information must be derived from other \r\nsources.\" <sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Pension Records:</strong> Most Union soldiers or widows or minor \r\nchildren applied for a pension. In other cases, a dependent father or \r\nmother would apply. There are 544 rolls of film that are indexed and \r\navailable for viewing through the National Archives and Records \r\nAdministration (NARA) (T288, General Index to Pension Files 1861-1934). \r\nThese records can be accessed in person at the National Archives (700 \r\nPennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20408-0001). No prior arrangement is\r\n necessary. Copies of records are available by mail, by using NATF Form \r\n85 (Pension) and NATF Form 86 (CMSR) for each soldier. The forms can be \r\nrequested by sending an email that includes your name and address, form \r\nnumber, and number of copies requested to <a href=\"mailto:inquire@nara.gov\">mailto:inquire@nara.gov</a>or by writing \r\nto: </p>\r\n<p>National Archives and Records Administration<br>Attn: NWDT1<br>700 \r\nPennsylvania Avenue, NW<br>Washington, DC 20408-0001 </p>\r\n<p>The National Archives and Records Administration also has a branch \r\noffice at the Frederick C. Murphy Federal Center, (380 Trapelo Road, \r\nWaltham, Mass., 02452-6399; phone [781] 647-8104; email:<a href=\"mailto:waltham.center@nara.gov\">waltham.center@nara.gov</a>. It serves the New England \r\nstates, and is open Monday, Tuesday, and Friday from 8 a.m to 4:30 p.m, \r\nand Wednesday and Thursday from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. No original records are\r\n pulled after 4 p.m. Civil War Pension records are not available at this\r\n branch, but there are a host of New England records available there, \r\nand researchers are best advised to call first.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Records of Events: </strong>Information about a soldier's war \r\nactivities can be deduced from the activities of each company. These \r\nwere compiled from the original muster rolls and returns, and vary in \r\ncontent. Some give day-by-day narratives of a company's activities. They\r\n rarely name individuals. The records of Union regiments are reproduced \r\non microfilm (225 rolls, M594, Compiled Records Showing Service of \r\nMilitary Units in Volunteer Union Organizations). Confederate regiments \r\nare reproduced in 74 rolls (M861, Compiled Records Showing Service of \r\nMilitary Units in Confederate Organizations). These rolls are arranged \r\nby state, by regiment and by company, and are being published as <em>Supplement\r\n to the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies</em>, 51 \r\nvolumes (Wilmington, NC: Broadfoot Publishing Co., 1994-97). </p>\r\n<p>Most states have published volumes of material that show infinite \r\ndetail about those who served from their state. There are six volumes \r\nissued by the Maine Adjutant General that provide much detail about the \r\nindividuals who served from that state: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Annual Report of the Adjutant General of State of Main</em>e, for \r\nthe Year ending December 31, 1861 </li>\r\n<li><em>Annual Report of the Adjutant General of State of Maine</em>, for \r\nthe Year ending December 31, 1862 </li>\r\n<li><em>Annual Report of the Adjutant General of State of Maine</em>, for \r\nthe Year ending December 31, 1863 </li>\r\n<li><em>Annual Report of the Adjutant General of State of Maine</em>, for \r\nthe Year 1864 and 1865, Vol 1. </li>\r\n<li><em>Annual Report of the Adjutant General of State of Maine</em>, for \r\nthe Year 1864 and 1865, Vol 2. </li>\r\n<li><em>Annual Report of the Adjutant General of State of Maine</em>, for \r\nthe Year ending December 31, 1866. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, these annual reports are difficult to navigate, owing \r\nto the lack of an index. It is therefore absolutely essential that \r\nresearchers know the military organization of the person being \r\nresearched. The alternative is to spend hours pouring over these \r\nfour-inch thick volumes. Even that may never yield the name of an \r\nancestor because he may appear in another volume, or in the same volume \r\nbut in a different company to which he may have been transferred. The \r\nstate of Maine recognized this, and issued a supplement <sup>5</sup>containing\r\n five different indices. Of particular note is the initial index of <em>Volunteers\r\n in Maine and U.S. Organizations</em>:</p>\r\n<p>Volunteers from April 1861 to 1 Jan 1863<br>Volunteers from 1 Jan \r\n1863 to the close of the war </p>\r\n<p>The other more singular reference is of <em>Persons Drafted, Furnished\r\n Substitutes in 1863</em>. Two remaining indices are of individuals: <em>Transferred\r\n and omitted</em> [and] <em>Additional</em>. These provide a smoother \r\ntransition into the earlier volumes and should permit more rapid \r\nidentification of ancestors. </p>\r\n<p><sup>1. </sup>Annual Report of the Adjutant General of the State of Maine \r\nfor the year ending December 31, 1861 (Augusta: Stevens &amp; Sayward, \r\nprinters to the state, 1862):81. <br><sup>2. </sup>Ibid, 52-53. <br><sup>3.</sup>\r\n Ibid, Appendix D:10. <br><sup>4.</sup> \r\nhttp://www.nara.gov/genealogy/civilwar.html. <br><sup>5.</sup> \r\nSupplement to the Annual Reports of the Adjutant General of the State of\r\n Maine for the years 1861, 62, 63, 64, 65, and 1866 (Augusta: Stevens \r\n&amp; Sayward, printers to the state, 1867).&#160;</p>\r\n</div></div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/maine-soldiers-in-the-civil-war/", "published": "", "id": 220}, {"author": "Russell C. Farnham, CG ", "country": "Maine", "title": "Maine Superior Court Records", "content": "<p>Most genealogists are aware of the absolute goldmine of information \r\nfound in the estate dockets of probate court. Wills often contain the \r\nnames of children and spouses, and occasionally include names of distant\r\n relatives, nephews, nieces, and grandchildren as well. In those other \r\ninstances in which the person died intestate, we rely on petitions for \r\nadministration, bond, appointment of guardian, or other documents \r\nfrequently found in the docket. These may also reveal names and \r\nrelationships of heirs. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Superior Court records usually contain little of \r\nthe detailed information found in probate court records (with some \r\nexceptions as noted later). Instead, they reveal real life events that \r\ntook place, which in turn can uncover insights about our ancestors. \r\nThese records can give clues as to their personality, beliefs, and their\r\n economic stature in their community, as well as the daily events they \r\nwere confronted with. </p>\r\n<p>Two centuries ago, our ancestors had no access to what we know today \r\nas Small Claims Court. It was then called Superior Court, or Common \r\nPleas Court. As is the case in today's society, Superior Court allowed \r\ncitizens the right to take their grievances into court without the \r\nexpense of an attorney. Our ancestors would often first make attempts to\r\n settle their differences without going to court, but when that failed, a\r\n grievance was filed in the court against a person or business that they\r\n felt had wronged them. Common complaints filed with the courts in the \r\n1800s included failure to make payments as scheduled by promissory note,\r\n wrongful seizure of property, land disputes, trespassing, and \r\nnegligence. If, after filing the grievance, the two parties were still \r\nunable to settle their differences, the plaintiff would proceed to sue \r\nthe other party. After hearing the complaint, the clerk would summarize \r\nit in a brief and then issue a writ to the county sheriff or deputy. \r\nThis served to activate the legal process on behalf of the plaintiff, \r\nenabling the sheriff to serve the complaint on the defendant. At the \r\nsame time, the sheriff was instructed to \"attach\" a piece of property \r\nbelonging to the defendant that had equal value to the amount of money \r\nthe plaintiff was seeking in his suit. If the sheriff could not find any\r\n items of equal value, he would attach anything he knew to be the \r\nproperty of the defendant, which served as proof of delivery of the \r\nsummons. In his return of the writ to the clerk, the sheriff noted \r\nthereon any \"attachments\" he made as well as deliverance of the summons \r\nfor the defendant to appear in court.</p>\r\n<p>Some of these attachments had an air of humor. For instance, it was \r\nnot uncommon for the sheriff to attach a hat that belonged to the \r\ndefendant, which may have been found sitting on a porch or out in a \r\nfield. Perhaps this was the sheriff's way of letting the plaintiff know \r\nthat he did not think much of the entire event. He may have also had \r\ndifficulty finding property that he knew to be owned by the defendant, \r\nyet he was committed to enforce the law. It was more common for a \r\nsheriff to place his attachment on real (or moving) estate that he knew \r\nbelonged to the defendant, such as a house or barn, livestock, or other \r\nproperty of importance to the defendant.</p>\r\n<p>Here are some typical cases in the Common Pleas Courts of Kennebec \r\nCounty: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>On 30 May 1804, Oliver Whipple of Hallowell, Esq., and Abigail his \r\nwife, plaintiffs, vs. Phillip Norcross of Chesterville, yeoman, \r\ndefendant. In a plea of ejectment, Oliver and Abigail sought the seizure\r\n and possession of an undivided fifth part of land consisting of 25 \r\nacres in Hallowell. The plaintiff alleged that at a time of peace within\r\n \"fifty years last past,\" one Sylvester Gardiner, father of Abigail \r\nWhipple, was owner of the tract and took possession to the value of $5. \r\nThe Whipples also asked for damages from Norcross in the amount of one \r\nthousand dollars. Norcross, defended by his attorney, pled not guilty. \r\nThe plaintiff's attorney claimed the defendant's plea was \"bad and \r\ninsufficient,\" but the court ruled in favor of the defendant and awarded\r\n him judgement, which permitted him to recover costs. One deposition in \r\nthe docket file mentions Abigail and names her siblings: Hannah \r\nHallowell, wife of Robert Hallowell; Rebecca Dumarsque, [sic] wife of \r\nPhillip Dumaresque; Ann Brown, widow of John Gardiner; and William \r\nGardiner, their only child. A separate deposition in the file shows that\r\n Dr. Sylvester Gardiner left six children and also names the daughters' \r\nspouses: William, John, Ann (who married Col A Brown), Hannah (Robert \r\nHallowell), Rebecca (Phillip Dumaresque), and Abigail (O. Whipple). The \r\nsame document goes on to show that William Gardiner died in 1786, \r\nunmarried and without issue. The depositions in this docket file also \r\nuncover some inconsistencies that require resolution from other sources.\r\n The jury ruled for the defendant, but the ruling was overturned on \r\nappeal. <sup>1<br></sup><br></li>\r\n<li>On 28 Nov 1808, Nathan Kinsman of Portland, gentleman, at the Court \r\nof Common Pleas held at Portland, Cumberland County, plaintiff, sued \r\nJohn Johnson of Hallowell, Kennebec County, \"otherwise of Portland,\" and\r\n Daniel Johnson of Portland, bookseller, defendants. The plaintiff \r\nalleged that on or about \"the twentieth day of October last,\" by their \r\nnote, they promised the plaintiff to pay him on order $992 in sixty \r\ndays. The plaintiff alleged that demands for payment were ignored and \r\nsought $2,000 in damages. The defendants failed to show up in court and \r\nKinsman was awarded a default judgment for $1,047.68, plus costs of \r\ncourt \"taxed at $19.14.\" The deputy sheriff, in his return, noted that \r\nper the writ, he attached \"the books and other property, a schedule of \r\nwhich is [annexed]\" of John and Daniel Johnson. The attachment listed 6 \r\npages of various merchandise, consisting of \"writing books, paint boxes,\r\n green pocket books, letter inkstands, snuff boxes, pounce box, tooth \r\nbrushes, bunches of quills, penknifes, 3 doz. playing cards, day book, \r\ncopies slips, dutch memorandum books, juvenile letters, 33 warblars, 26 \r\ncopies of village Harmony, 3 copies of whole duty of women, 32 copies of\r\n art of reading, 3 copies Pinkerton's Geography, etc, etc, etc\". <sup>2</sup><br><br></li>\r\n<li>On 11 Mar 1839, Samuel Longfellow of Hallowell, yeoman, brought suit\r\n against Stephen Packard of Augusta, cabinet maker, and Otis Packard of \r\nRoxbury, Norfolk County, Massachusetts, merchant. The plaintiff alleged \r\nthat on 16 Jan 1836, by promissory note, the defendants promised to pay \r\nJohn Hubbard Jr. five hundred dollars within three years, with annual \r\ninterest. Hubbard then endorsed the note to the plaintiff, who made \r\ndemand on the defendants. The defendants, however, refused to pay him. \r\nThe deputy sheriff, James B. Norris, stated in his return that he \r\nattached all of the defendants' real estate that he could find in the \r\ncounty, which included \"the Brick Buildings &amp; land now occupied by \r\nsaid Stephen Packard and others in the village of Augusta.\" The sheriff,\r\n at the time of the attachment, also served the defendant Stephen \r\nPackard with a summons to appear in court. The sheriff's costs, as noted\r\n in his return, were 4 cents for travel, 15 cents for copy request, 10 \r\ncents paid request, another travel cost of 4 cents, and fifty cents for \r\nan abstract, for a total of $1.83. It was later revealed that \"Stephen \r\nPackard has been and now is arrested by James B Norris, a Deputy \r\nSheriff,\" and that an execution was issued against him for $616.70. A \r\nwrit of execution was awarded and a public auction was held, after being\r\n advertised in the newspaper. From the sale, Longfellow realized \r\n$334.38, which he received from the deputy sheriff on 3 Dec 1839. <sup>3</sup><br><br></li>\r\n<li>Amos Pollard of Sidney, yeoman, was summoned on 18 Apr 1806 to \r\nappear and answer to a complaint of the proprietors of the Kennebec \r\nPurchase from the late colony of New Plymouth in a plea of ejectment. \r\nThe allegation was made that Pollard had illegal possession of a piece \r\nof land in Sidney that was part of lot number 11 in the fourth range of \r\nlots, according to surveyor John Jones. The plaintiffs alleged that \r\n\"within thirty years last past they were seized of the demanded premises\r\n in their own right and as of fee takeing the profits thereof to the \r\nvalue of ten dollars by the years and being so seized thereof, the said \r\nPollard unjustly and without judgment of law entered into the same and \r\nejected the plaintiffs and hath ever since and still doth unjustly keep \r\nthem out.\" In serving the summons, deputy sheriff Jason D. Cony stated, \r\n\"I have summoned the within named Pollard by reading this writ loud in \r\nhis hearing.\" When Pollard came to defend, his attorney Solomon \r\n(Jonathan?) Vose stated that Pollard was not guilty. The plaintiffs \r\nresponded that the plea was \"insufficient\" and asked for judgment. The \r\nfile does not show the outcome, but it could likely be found in land \r\ndeeds. <sup>4</sup> </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The above examples reveal only the tip of the iceberg, but they show \r\nthat Superior Court records can provide genealogists with a good amount \r\nof interesting detail about our ancestors. Some documents are very \r\ndifficult to read as the handwriting is not the most fluid, but with \r\nexperience this obstacle can be overcome. Before attempting to research \r\ncourt documents, it is important to check with the county clerk's office\r\n to find out exactly what records have been preserved (dates, and/or \r\ndocket numbers, indexes, etc) and where they are being held. In the \r\nstate of Maine, most cases are sent to the Maine State Archives in \r\nAugusta. However this is not necessarily true in every instance. The \r\nbest rule is to first start at the county level and then write to the \r\nMaine State Archives (84 State House Station, Augusta, ME, 04333-0084). \r\nThe Archives' <a href=\"http://www.state.me.us/sos/arc/\" target=\"_new\">website</a>\r\n also provides additional details about the types of court records in \r\ntheir holdings and the histories of the various courts in the state. A \r\nnominal fee is charged for photocopying of the documents in these case \r\nfiles. </p>\r\n<p>Searchable name indexes of county court cases are available <a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.com/%7Eusgenweb/me/mecourt.html/\" target=\"_new\">online</a> for the following counties: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>York County (1686-1760)<br></li>\r\n<li>Kennebec County (1799-1854)<br></li>\r\n<li>Washington County (1839-1845)<br></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<sup>1. </sup>Kennebec County \r\nCommon Pleas Court, Oct 1805, Vol 2, pg 328<br><br><sup>2. </sup>\r\nKennebec County Common Pleas Court, Oct 1811, Vol D3, pg 190<br><br><sup>3.\r\n</sup> Kennebec County Common Pleas Court, Oct 1839, vol 10, pg 37<br><br><sup>4.\r\n</sup> Kennebec County Common Pleas Court, Jun 1807, vol 2, pg 529&#160;", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/maine-superior-court-records/", "published": "", "id": 221}, {"author": "Russell C. Farnham, CG ", "country": "Maine", "title": "Marriages Performed by the Rev. Josiah Winship, Woolwich Church, Maine (1765- 1821)", "content": "<p>&#160;Church records are probably the most sought after genealogical record. \r\nThe fact that these entries were made in journals by the minister \r\nperforming the marriage, who also had occasion to record the baptisms or\r\n deaths of individuals belonging to his church, are surely the foremost \r\nreason for the popularity of this record. A record of a marriage \r\nperformed by the town clerk or a justice of the peace, while also \r\nconsidered an original record, just does not carry the same weight. \r\nThose administered and recorded by a man of the cloth are irrefutable \r\nevidence, offering little opportunity for challenge. <br><br>To be sure,\r\n there are likely exceptions to this personal belief, but for the moment\r\n I wish to focus on the marriages performed at the Woolwich Church by \r\nthe Rev. Josiah Winship, of Boston and Harvard College, who was selected\r\n to become minister at the Nequasset Township, Sagadahoc County, Maine \r\nin 1764. He was not inclined to accept the invitation to Woolwich \r\n[successor of Nequasset] until the following year when he was ordained \r\nJune 12, 1765, and the Nequasset Church organized by the \"seven pillars \r\nor founders.\" They were Rev. Josiah Winship, Samuel Ford, Jonathan Reed,\r\n Benjamin Shaw, Joshua Bailey, Samuel Blanchard, and Nathaniel Thwing. \r\nRev Winship would serve fifty-nine years until his death in 1824.  </p>\r\n<p>The\r\n marriages performed from 1765 to 1821 by Rev. Winship are from a \r\nforty-six-page typescript document abstracted by the Daughters of the \r\nRevolution at the Maine State Archives in Augusta, Maine. It has been \r\ncompared with the original manuscript, and in some instances names and \r\ndates as they appear in the DAR document were changed to coincide with \r\nthe original manuscript [these are underlined]. The DAR document also \r\ncontains a numerical list of members of the church (1765-1809) and date \r\nof admission (1765-1800), including the dates of death of members, the \r\ndates they \"owned ye covenant,\" baptisms (1765-1823), and deaths (1765-1824).\r\n </p>\r\n <p>The original copy of Rev. Winship's journal is in possession of\r\n Roland Bailey, a member of the Woolwich Historical Society. A photocopy\r\n is on file at the Woolwich town offices and Woolwich Historical \r\nSociety. As with any transcribed document, researchers should be aware \r\nthe spelling in the original document is as it appears in Rev. Winship's\r\n journal. Variations in surnames and Christian names are commonly found \r\nthroughout this document. Interested researchers may wish to consult the\r\n original manuscript at the Woolwich Historical Society, by prior \r\narrangement with Mr. Bailey. He may be contacted at 1134 Old Stage Rd., \r\nWoolwich, Maine 04579, (207)-882-6891. </p>\r\n <p>[1] Burnette Bailey Wallace and Frances Soule \r\nMaher, compilers <em>History of Woolwich, Maine &#8211; A Town Remembered </em>(Woolwich\r\n Historical Society, 1994), pg 26. </p>\r\n <p>[2] Typescript, DAR, <em>Records of the Rev.

Farnham, CG ", "country": "Maine", "title": "Pownalborough Courthouse Collection at the Maine Historical Society", "content": "<p>The Pownalborough Courthouse Collection (#1924) at the Maine Historical \r\nSociety in Portland, Maine, is a seldom used but solid genealogical resource. \r\nThis particular collection is certainly not only unique, but one of the largest \r\nof its kind in Maine. Dedicated volunteers of the Lincoln County Cultural &amp; \r\nHistorical Association compiled a broad typescript summary of the contents, \r\nwhich provides detailed identification of the papers and folders in the \r\ncollection.&#160;This project began in 1970, and was revised in 1990 and 2001.&#160; The \r\n2001 update includes a summation that will enable interested genealogists \r\nresearching eighteenth and nineteenth century ancestors in that area to make a \r\nrapid determination of the relevant folders in the collection.&#160; One can imagine \r\nthe enormous difficulty of trying to navigate through eighty-six boxes of \r\ndocuments and sixteen boxes of charts, maps, and plans of larger items without \r\nthis convenient catalog! </p>\r\n<p>A background of the origin of the collection is in order.&#160; Major Samuel \r\nGoodwin (1716-1802) was one of the Plymouth Proprietors in the Kennebec \r\nPurchase, being agent and clerk of that company.&#160; His descendants were ship \r\nowners, shipmasters, farmers, businessmen, and local officials, whose records of \r\nlegal matters and life events went through the Pownalborough Courthouse.&#160; So the \r\ncollection concerns them as well as their family members, friends, relatives, \r\nand business associates.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The numerous papers, books, ledgers, and memorabilia of all sorts were stored \r\nin various trunks and boxes at the Pownalborough Courthouse until 1952, when the \r\nAlfred Canby family took possession of the collection.&#160; The arrangement of \r\ndocuments and papers, were initially filed by individual names, but over the \r\nyears this arrangement became disturbed. Poor storage conditions led to the \r\ndecision to move the collection.&#160; The Lincoln County Cultural and Historical \r\nAssociation at Wiscasset agreed to care for and accept responsibility for the \r\ncollection from the Canby family in 1955.&#160;&#160; Professional advice was sought and \r\nthe entire collection was&#160; placed in a third floor area that was safe and free \r\nof possible exposure to the elements.&#160;&#160; In 1998, by deed of gift from the Canby \r\nfamily [acting for the Goodwin-Johnson heirs], a transfer of the collection to \r\nthe Maine Historical Society was completed.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Papers and documents in the collection should be of great interest to the \r\nGoodwin, Johnson, and Prescott-Canby families of that era.&#160; The Samuel Goodwin \r\nfamily was briefly treated in the <em>Maine Families in 1790</em> series [1] and \r\nmention of the collection and associated families is also found in the NEHGR \r\n<em>Register</em>.[2] &#160; But there is bound to be more information in this \r\ncollection that will interest genealogists researching Dresden in the very early \r\nnineteenth century.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The Pilgrims came to the area to trade with the Indians for furs to send to \r\nEngland to pay their debts.&#160; Settlers from France and Germany came in \r\nmid-eighteenth century.&#160; The town of Pownalborough was incorporated in 1760, the \r\nsame year that Lincoln County was established, and it became the county seat. \r\nThe Court House built at Pownalborough was named after Thomas Pownal, the Royal \r\nGovernor in Boston.&#160; The original town included all of the present towns of \r\nWiscasset, Dresden, Alna, and Perkins or Swan Island. The town residents soon \r\nrealized the need to divide the large town into precincts or parishes, and the \r\neast parish of Pownalborough (now Wiscasset) was created in 1773. </p>\r\n<p>By 1794 the west parish towns of Dresden and New Milford (Alna) were set off. \r\nThe courts were then transferred to the east parish, which in 1802 was named \r\nWiscasset. Dresden became famous in the middle of the nineteenth century when \r\nice from the Kennebec River was shipped all over the world.&#160;&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The papers, maps, and published books and posters of the era remained in the \r\nOld Court House of Dresden for 200 years and have since been grouped into two \r\nbroad categories, &#8220;Goodwin&#8221; and &#8220;Dresden.&#8221; [3] &#160; The genealogies and names of \r\nthe Pownalborough families are worthy of further mention: [4] </p>\r\n<p><strong>Capt. Samuel Goodwin</strong>: Included are family papers (1753-1916), \r\naccounts, daybooks, etc. [5] William Goodwin was the nephew of Major Samuel \r\nGoodwin, who resided in Charlestown by the ferry, and later in Boston.&#160; He \r\ncollected fares for the ferry and tolls for the bridge, and owned lands on the \r\nupper Kennebec.&#160; He and his father were styled &#8220;Chaise-Makers.&#8221;&#160; </p>\r\n<p>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; William Goodwin took for his second wife Abigail Goodwin, daughter of \r\nSamuel.&#160; She was the widow of Capt. Thomas Johnson, who died in 1776.&#160; After the \r\ndeath of Goodwin, Abigail lived in Charlestown until 1839 when Thomas Johnson, \r\nadministrator of her husband&#8217;s estate, had her come to live at Pownalborough \r\nwhere she died at age 93.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Caroline Louise Prescott (1829-1919), niece of Thomas Johnson, was \r\nmarried in 1855 to William J. Canby of Philadelphia.&#160; The Prescott-Canby papers \r\nare from 1801-1898. </p>\r\n<p>3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Her sister, Sarah Augusta Prescott (1830-1914), was married to Capt. \r\nSamuel Randolph Goodwin in 1852 and went to sea with him on many voyages.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Capt. John Johnson (1741-1813), son-in-law of Major Goodwin, was an \r\nearly postmaster at Pownalborough.&#160; Family papers of the Johnson family are from \r\n1772-1901. </p>\r\n<p>5.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Thomas Johnson (1778-1850) was another early postmaster.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>6.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Martha Ann Johnson (1824-1891), the sister of Sarah, was married in \r\n1848 to James F. B. Marshall.&#160; They lived in Hawaii and Washington. </p>\r\n<p>7.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Henry C. Pratt was a resident of Charlestown, but originally was from \r\nOrford, New Hampshire. He was a well-known portrait painter of the \r\nmid-nineteenth century.&#160; In 1831 he married Sarah Howard Johnson (1797-1882), \r\nwho was daughter of John Johnson of Charlestown and niece of Thomas Johnson.&#160; \r\nSeveral of his portraits of members of the &#8220;Court House Family&#8221; hang in the \r\ncourt today.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>8.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; James F. B. Marshall went to Hawaii in 1839 where he became a partner \r\nin the C. Brewer Company.&#160; While on a business trip back to Boston he married \r\nMartha Ann Johnson (1824-1891) who was daughter of John Johnson (see #6). </p>\r\n<p>9.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Jonathan Bowman was one of the initial justices in Lincoln County.&#160; \r\nHe took as his second wife Ann Goodwin, who was granddaughter of Major Samuel \r\nGoodwin.&#160; Jonathan was born 1735 in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and graduated \r\nfrom Harvard in 1755. He was a classmate of John Adams and others of that class \r\nwho became prominent citizens.&#160; Judge Bowman was a heavy investor in lands and \r\nshipping, amassing a large estate over the years.&#160; He was politically astute and \r\nsided against the King in the years before 1776.&#160; Papers of the Bowman family \r\nare from 1761-1856.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong><u>Dresden</u></strong>: </p>\r\n<p>The files of Jonathan Bowman, judge of probate, were moved to the court from \r\nBowman&#8217;s home after his death. They contain legal matters concerning civil \r\ndisputes (1760-1795),&#160; such as line disagreements, lawsuits, and writs, as well \r\nas probate records, and original deeds.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The thirteen folders that comprise the &#8220;Town of Dresden Affairs&#8221; papers \r\nconcern a multitude of subjects, most of which are commonly found in \r\nnineteenth-century town records.

Maine Newspaper Collections", "content": "<a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/preserv/usnppr.html\" target=\"new\">The United States Newspaper Program </a>(USNP) is an \r\nongoing cooperative national effort among the states and the federal \r\ngovernment to locate, catalog, and preserve on microfilm newspapers \r\npublished in the United States from the eighteenth century to the \r\npresent.&#160; Funding is by a grant from the National Endowment for the \r\nHumanities, with technical assistance by the Library of Congress.&#160; <div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p>The USNP has supported projects in each of the fifty \r\nstates, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin \r\nIslands.&#160; Each project is conducted by a single organization within a \r\nstate or territory, usually the state&#8217;s largest newspaper repository.&#160; \r\nStaff then will inventory holdings in public libraries, county \r\ncourthouses, newspaper offices, historical museums, college and \r\nuniversity libraries, archives, and historical societies.&#160; Catalog \r\nrecords are entered into a national database maintained by the Online \r\nComputer Library Center (OCLC), that are accessible through more than \r\n15,000 dedicated computer terminals worldwide. Microfilm copies of \r\nnewspapers produced under this program are available to researchers \r\nanywhere in the country through interlibrary loan.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Within Maine, this project is being overseen by \r\nJanet Roberts, project coordinator of the Maine Newspaper Project (MNP) \r\nfor the Maine State Library, who is focused on finding collections \r\nthroughout the state that will be integrated into this system.&#160; The \r\nMaine project team has completed its inventory work, and preliminary \r\noverview information on newspaper titles and holdings for each county \r\nhas been sent to every library, historical society, and museum in that \r\ncounty.&#160; MNP hopes to be able to place this information on a searchable \r\ndatabase on the Internet in the near future. </p>\r\n<p>Newspapers\r\n are universally recognized as a valuable tool to genealogists, who \r\noften find themselves stymied in the search for information of elusive \r\nancestors.&#160; Obituaries often provide answers.&#160; Finding an obituary in an\r\n old newspaper is usually not a difficult chore if the researcher knows \r\nthe date and place of death, and is able to access the paper.&#160; It is \r\noften necessary to review many reels of unindexed film, if the newspaper\r\n is even available on film.&#160; Of secondary interest is the desire to \r\nlearn more about lifestyles of the past. Possibly a major event or \r\nnewsworthy subject is the interest.&#160; Whatever it may be, the newspaper \r\ncan provide the genealogist with detailed information that will permit a\r\n more realistic picture of the times that our ancestor lived in.&#160;&#160; </p>\r\n<p>That is the easy part.&#160; Then the researcher must \r\ndetermine what newspapers survived and where newspaper collections can \r\nbe found in order to conduct a search. Fortunately, various Maine \r\nrepositories decided long ago to begin collecting newspapers, or to \r\nsiphon data out of these papers that would be useful to genealogists. \r\nThere is no single source or document that provides the Maine \r\ngenealogist a broad view of the newspaper resources in the state.&#160; It is\r\n not the intent to offer in this article anything resembling an \r\nall-inclusive look at such a list or document, but rather to highlight \r\nthe core newspaper collections in the state of Maine.&#160; These collections\r\n can be found at the Maine State Library (MSL) in Augusta, the Fogler \r\nLibrary at the University of Maine in Orono, and in Portland, the \r\nPortland Public Library, and Maine Historical Society.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.state.me.us/msl/\" target=\"new\"><strong>Maine\r\n State Library </strong></a><br>State House Station # 64<br>Augusta, \r\nMaine 04333<br>207-287-5600<br><br>Most of the older paper copies of \r\nnewspapers at the MSL are stored off-site, so they need to be ordered a \r\nday in advance of a planned visit. The MSL has an extensive microfilm \r\ncollection, but genealogists are encouraged to contact the library by \r\nphone to determine if the paper being sought is available. Requests must\r\n be very specific, i.e., &#8220;<em>Kennebec Journal</em> of February 21, \r\n1876.&#8221;&#160;&#160; </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.library.umaine.edu/\" target=\"new\"><strong>Fogler\r\n Library </strong></a><br>University of Maine<br>5729 Raymond H.

Once the Special Collections page\r\n has been accessed look to the lower right side of the page for a link \r\ntitled &#8220;Maine Newspapers.&#8221; From this page you will see two links at the \r\ntop of the page that permit the researcher to view the newspapers either\r\n by &#8220;title&#8221; or &#8220;location of publisher&#8221; of the paper. The most common \r\nusage of interest to the genealogist is the &#8220;location of publisher&#8221; \r\noption, as most genealogists (myself included) have little or no idea \r\nwhich paper was putting out the news 100 or 150 years ago.&#160; But we most \r\ndefinitely are tuned in to the &#8220;location&#8221; of our research problem!&#160; </p>\r\n<p>By clicking on this option, a listing of the \r\nnewspapers appears, sorted alphabetically by town or city, which also \r\nshows the dates (by year of publication) that are available at the \r\nlibrary.&#160; The list shows, for instance, twenty-one papers available in \r\nthe city of Augusta, ranging from specialized interest papers (<em>Maine \r\nState Labor News</em>) and religious newspapers (<em>Gospel Banner and \r\nMaine Christian Pilot</em>) to traditional newspapers such as the <em>Kennebec\r\n Journal</em> and the<em> Kennebec Weekly Journal</em>. Most of the Augusta\r\n newspapers are not on microfilm, so access to the original copies must \r\nbe ordered at the Fogler Library a week in advance through the Special \r\nCollections Department (email them at <a href=\"mailto:%20spc@umit.maine.edu\">spc@umit.maine.edu</a>or call at the\r\n number above).&#160;The earliest <em>Journal</em> newspapers available \r\ncommence from 1825 (<em>Kennebec Weekly Journal</em>), with scattered \r\nissues. A more complete collection of the <em>Kennebec Journal</em> is \r\nfound from 1870 to the present.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Eighteen \r\nBangor newspapers are listed under a variety of names, some of which (as\r\n with any paper) may be the same paper, but under new owners or \r\nmanagement and with a new name. Only a small number of issues of some \r\npapers are available. As expected, the deepest newspaper collections are\r\n from the metropolitan areas.&#160; In Augusta it was the <em>Kennebec Journal\r\n </em>and the <em>Kennebec Weekly Journal</em>.&#160; The library has the <em>Bangor\r\n Daily Whig and Courier</em> on microfilm from 1836 to 1900 and the <em>Bangor\r\n Daily News</em> from 1900 to the present. The <em>Bangor Commercial</em> \r\noffers an opportunity for a further look into the late nineteenth \r\ncentury (1872-1956), although it may lack human-interest stories owing \r\nto its title. These newspapers can also be found at the Bangor Public \r\nLibrary (see below for more information). This highlights an important \r\npoint: do not give up if the paper you seek is not at a certain \r\nlocation&#8212;you may find it at a different repository. There may be other \r\ninstitutions that extracted information from the same common source. \r\nSmall local libraries and historical or genealogical societies should \r\nnot be overlooked as they often have select issues of paper copies, or \r\nhave compiled their own abstracts (indices) of local residents for their\r\n archival collections.&#160;&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The following list \r\nrepresents selected towns and city newspapers that are included in the \r\ncollection at the Fogler Library, showing the earliest date <em>any</em> \r\nnewspaper from these locations is available. This may only consist of a \r\nsingle issue or the collection may jump to a later date. For instance, \r\nyou may only find a single issue of a Kennebunk newspaper in 1802 before\r\n jumping ten years to 1812.&#160; Typically, researchers will wish to access \r\nthe Fogler Library website (or contact library staff), to determine the \r\nprecise issues available.&#160; As in any situation, it is wise to do your \r\nhomework before traveling to the library. </p>\r\n<table width=\"50%\" border=\"1\" class=\"contentTableText\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>Town</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>Earliest date of newspaper&#160; </strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Alfred</td>\r\n<td>1915</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Auburn</td>\r\n<td>1880</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Augusta</td>\r\n<td>1825</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Bangor</td>\r\n<td>1836</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Bar Harbor </td>\r\n<td>1881</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Bath</td>\r\n<td>1820</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Belfast</td>\r\n<td>1820</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Biddeford</td>\r\n<td>1860</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Brunswick</td>\r\n<td>1820</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Calais</td>\r\n<td>1832</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Camden</td>\r\n<td>1869</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Caribou</td>\r\n<td>1880</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Castine</td>\r\n<td>1809</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Clinton</td>\r\n<td>1879</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Damariscotta</td>\r\n<td>1860</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Dover-Foxcroft</td>\r\n<td>1828</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Eastport</td>\r\n<td>1819</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Ellsworth</td>\r\n<td>1851</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Farmington</td>\r\n<td>1840</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Gardiner</td>\r\n<td>1826</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Hallowell</td>\r\n<td>1810</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Houlton</td>\r\n<td>1860</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Kennebunk</td>\r\n<td>1802</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Lewiston</td>\r\n<td>1847</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Machias</td>\r\n<td>1823</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Norridgewock</td>\r\n<td>1844</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Norway</td>\r\n<td>1824</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Old Town </td>\r\n<td>1875</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Paris</td>\r\n<td>1827</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Pittsfield</td>\r\n<td>1882</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Portland&#160;</td>\r\n<td>1798</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Presque Isle </td>\r\n<td>1857</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Rockland</td>\r\n<td>1852</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Rumford&#160;</td>\r\n<td>1893</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Saco</td>\r\n<td>1845</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Sanford</td>\r\n<td>1923</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Skowhegan</td>\r\n<td>1842</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>South Paris </td>\r\n<td>1833</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Thomaston</td>\r\n<td>1832</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Waldoboro&#160;</td>\r\n<td>1873</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Waterville</td>\r\n<td>1849</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td height=\"17\">Westbrook</td>\r\n<td height=\"17\">1901</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Wilton</td>\r\n<td>1881</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Wiscasset</td>\r\n<td>1859</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>York</td>\r\n<td>1901</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p><br>In addition to these original newspapers, the \r\nFogler Library also keeps numerous published resources containing \r\nabstracted information of death notices, marriages, and divorces.&#160; The \r\npublished books do not contain copies of obituaries.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Published books on the subject are:&#160;&#160; </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li><em>Abstracts of Death Notices \r\n1833-1852 and Miscellaneous News Items from the Maine Farmer 1833-1924</em>,\r\n David C.

Farnham, CG", "country": "Maine", "title": "Research in North-Central Maine", "content": "<p>Because of travel time and distances, genealogists doing research in Maine \r\nquickly learn the value of familiarity with archives and existing record \r\ntranscripts (print, typescript, manuscript, or microfilm). Maine is so large \r\nthat most of the rest of New England could fit within its boundaries. But unlike \r\nsmaller areas or states, the commute to the north-central part of Maine requires \r\nsome planning. And consider the largest cities, Augusta and Bangor. They offer \r\nthe best opportunities for research. The Maine State Archives (MSA) at Augusta \r\nis the single state repository and holds the largest amount of published \r\nmaterial, including filmed copies of town records. Easy access to the office of \r\nVital Records, Department of Human Resources, is readily available just a short \r\nwalk across the street.</p>\r\n<p>Generally speaking, genealogical research in north-central Maine is \r\nconcentrated in the repositories listed below. The collections, from the largest \r\nto the smallest, are the most popular and certainly the best known in the \r\nregion. Many small-town libraries throughout the region have small collections, \r\nas do numerous local genealogical or historical societies. Owing to budget and \r\nstaff constraints, the limitations are understandable. But researchers would be \r\nill advised to shun or ignore the important role \"local\" libraries can play in \r\ngood research. It is a given in this business that experienced genealogists make \r\na beeline to the well-known facilities before they concentrate on the local \r\ncollections. In my view, it is generally advisable to go to the largest facility \r\nfirst. If answers are not there, go to the local collection. </p>\r\n<p>Local librarians are an invaluable resource. They know that vast numbers of \r\npeople are searching for their family roots. It follows that, given budgetary \r\nconstraints, they are interested in collecting any research done by local \r\nfamilies on their ancestors but especially ancestral lines that include the \r\ntowns early settlers. They also may have on their shelves family histories \r\n(published in limited quantity) that may not have found their way into the \r\nlarger repositories. Vertical files are another valuable resource and can \r\nrepresent an assemblage of material from a variety of sources (newspaper \r\nclippings, obituaries, notes, copies, handwritten letters, military documents) \r\nand are apt to represent extremes. Many are very well organized and neatly put \r\ntogether. Others may be cluttered, with little or no mention of sources or \r\nspecificity. But information found in localized vertical files is often pure \r\ngold and can be used to bridge a gap. It can provide important clues for the \r\nresearcher to nail down the facts (and sources). Librarians can also assist the \r\nresearcher by offering contact information for local historical and genealogical \r\nsocieties as well as for the single most informed person on genealogy or early \r\nfamilies for the area. I like to refer to that person as the local \"guru.\" In \r\nany event, I never give up a search without contacting that person. </p>\r\n<p>The repositories discussed in this article are: </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Maine State Archives (MSA), Augusta </li>\r\n<li>Penobscot Marine Museum, Stephen Phillips Memorial Library, containing the \r\nPriscilla Jones Genealogical Collection </li>\r\n<li>University of Maine, Orono, Fogler Library </li>\r\n<li>Sagadahoc History and Genealogy, Patten Free Library </li>\r\n<li>Alvin &amp; Whitmore Memorial Collection, Ellsworth Public Library </li>\r\n<li>Bangor Public Library</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.state.me.us/sos/arc/\" target=\"_new\"><strong>The Maine State \r\nArchives</strong></a><br>The Maine Cultural Building in Augusta houses the State \r\nArchives, Library, and Museum.

No bags, attache cases, or purses are permitted beyond the sign-in desk. \r\nOnly pencils and note pads can be used within the collection. The most common \r\nresearch tool used here are the Maine censuses (1790-1920) and filmed copies of \r\ntown records, containing vital records, meetings, petitions, and so forth. \r\nGenerally speaking, these are the same records that have been filmed by the \r\nMormon Church. Researchers may also ask to use the Civil War Soldiers Index. \r\nThis card index contains the names of all Maine soldiers who served in the Civil \r\nWar and are more definitive than the published Adjutant General Reports. The \r\ncard shows the age of the soldier, where he was born, residence, occupation, \r\npersonal features, and more. </p>\r\n<p>Requests for photocopies of birth, marriages, and deaths (1892-1922) should \r\nbe directed to the Maine State Archives, State House Station #84, Augusta, ME \r\n04333-0084; telephone (207) 287-3184. Requests should be explicit, showing the \r\nfull name of the individual, the date and location of the event. If a birth \r\nrecord is requested the staff need to know the father's name.</p>\r\n<p>A little-known resource at the State Archives are records submitted by town \r\nclerks in compliance with the Maine Vital Record Act of 1865.

The approximate dates \r\nvary, but most begin 1863 and end 1865-67. Some, however, extend (with gaps) \r\ninto the 1880s. Some commenced in 1885-86. A complete list by town and \r\napproximate date can be found in the <em>Maine Genealogist</em> (Nov. 1996): \r\n153-160. By legislation, Maine again instigated the registration of vital \r\nstatistics and records in 1892.

It is generally organized \r\nby <em>subject</em> matter or <em>discipline</em>. There is no single genealogical \r\nsection. </p>\r\n<p>Each of the United States censuses of Maine, 1790 to 1920 is available on \r\nfilm. Many, if not all, of these pre-1850 films, include the censuses of the \r\nother states. For instance, the reel containing the 1810 census of Maine also \r\ncontains CT, DE, KY, LA, MD, MA, NH, NY, NC, PA, RI, SC, TN, VT and VA. The reel \r\nof the 1830 census contains Maine as well as CT, MA, NH, RI and VT. Also \r\navailable is an index and finding aid to the Maine 1800-1850 censuses. The \r\nSoundex (index) to the 1880, 1900, and 1920 Maine censuses are also available on \r\nfilm.</p>\r\n<p>Name and geographic indexes are also available for Ontario, Canada. \r\nAdditionally, the nominal censuses of Lower Canada (1769-1835, 1825, 1831, 1842, \r\n1851), New Brunswick (1851-1901, every ten years), Nova Scotia (1851-1901, every \r\nten years), Prince Edward Island (1841, 1861, 1881, 1891, 1901), and Quebec \r\n(1851-1901, every ten years) are also available on film. </p>\r\n<p>Among the most popular resources is the vast collection of Maine Newspapers. \r\nThey are coded as either available on microfilm or not. The latter require a \r\nweeks advanced notice. Many of the papers have huge date gaps. The number of \r\ntitles is too extensive to present here, but an index to the entire collection \r\ncan is available on the <a href=\"http://library.umaine.edu/speccoll/newspapers_location.htm\" target=\"_new\">Internet</a>. To take advantage of the collection, and before \r\nvisiting the library, the researcher should initially focus on the town (or the \r\nnewspaper <em>name</em>). First, identify the location where a particular \r\ngenealogical problem exists. Then go to this web address for that location. See \r\nif the newspaper for that year is available on film. When navigating the index, \r\nkeep in mind that many newspapers provided <em>regional</em> coverage and were not \r\nconfined to a local market. So the <em>Goodtime Gazette</em> may cover a region \r\nnot readily identifiable by the name of the paper. Or the town of <em>Happy</em> \r\nmay be included in the region covered by the <em>Goodtime Gazette</em>. The \r\ninternet source also has another index by newspaper name. For example, in \r\nBiddeford there is the <em>Biddeford Journal</em> as well as <em>La Justice de \r\nBiddeford</em> , the<em>Union and Eastern Journal,</em> and <em>Union and \r\nJournal</em>, each of which are available on film, but for drastically different \r\nperiods (some extended, some short). There is an extensive collection of the \r\n<em>Biddeford Weekly Journal</em> covering more than fifty years (1877-1930), but \r\nthe <em>Union and Eastern Journal</em> consists of a single issue (8/18/1854).</p>\r\n<p>Typically, the buzzword for using this collection is <em>familiarity</em>. Know \r\nyour research and your problems. If all other resources have been exhausted, the \r\nresearcher would be well advised to visit the library to use this extensive \r\ncollection. It could very well help solve a mystery. The library is located on \r\nthe grounds of the University of Maine, Orono, ME 05729, telephone (207) \r\n581-1110. Copy machines are available as well as microfilm reader/printers (10 \r\ncents per copy).

Farnham, CG ", "country": "Maine", "title": "Research Report: The Pursuit of the Nathan Longfellow Family", "content": "<p>In the process of compiling a new opus on the Longfellow family, I recently had \r\noccasion to research the family of Nathan Longfellow, born in Whitefield, Maine, \r\nDecember 26, 1805, the son of Jacob Longfellow. What follows is the account of \r\nmy pursuit of the Nathan Longfellow family and the methodology of creating and \r\nexecuting a research plan. </p>\r\n<p>I knew little about Nathan Longfellow. He graduated from Bowdoin College, \r\nspent a year as a teacher, and then took a position at a private seminary in \r\nAtlanta, Georgia. However that record does not give any indication whether he \r\nwas teaching there or if he may have been leaning toward the priesthood. \r\nSomething to place in the \"things to do\" hopper! After eight years, Nathan \r\nreturned to New England and married Eliza Wayne Southwick, allegedly at \r\nVassalboro, Maine, February 6, 1844, and they settled in Wellesley Hills, \r\nMassachusetts. (I reminded myself it would be important to look at published \r\n<em>Southwick Genealogies</em> to possibly learn of Eliza's parentage. Another \r\nthing to place in my \"things to do\" hopper!) Nathan acquired a paper mill from \r\nthe well-known Crane family and took up farming later in life. His teaching \r\nbackground clearly influenced his decision to aid his community by serving on \r\nthe school committee, which he did for 24 years. </p>\r\n<p>But I needed to learn more about him. Off I went to the most logical \r\nrepository, the New England Historic Genealogical Society (NEHGS) in Boston. A \r\ncursory examination of the vast archival material there did not yield much, but \r\na published index of the Norfolk County Probate Court files more or less \r\nconfirmed Nathan's death at Wellesley in 1894. That year coincides exactly with \r\ninformation I had from other sources, and as he was the only known Nathan \r\nLongfellow with a presence there, there is no question as to the identity. \r\nMoreover, just above his name was Eliza W. Longfellow, surely his wife. But a \r\nthird entry for a Nathan Longfellow at Wellesley, this one in 1892, really got \r\nmy attention, as this was a guardian file. Hmmm! How could this be? Could it be \r\nan unknown son of the same name? But the date was before the death of either \r\nNathan or wife Eliza! </p>\r\n<p>I went downstairs at NEHGS, where I was able to access the probate court \r\nfiles of Norfolk County on microfilm. Having already printed a copy of the \r\nprobate index page containing Nathan, it was now necessary to correlate that \r\ndocket number with the volume and page index. To my astonishment, the guardian \r\ndocket on Nathan Longfellow showed the order concerned him, and was a result of \r\na petition filed by his wife Eliza W. Longfellow, and daughter Fannie E. \r\nLongfellow, in 1892. He was declared \"insane, and incapable of caring for \r\nhimself.\" I shrugged this off as nothing more than the normal aging process, as \r\nNathan was then 87 years old. </p>\r\n<p>The following day I made plans for my next stop at the Middlesex County \r\nProbate Court in Cambridge. I wanted to be certain that those probate files did \r\nnot hold any of the Wellesley families. Before leaving, I had to be certain that \r\nthe court still possessed 150-year-old probate files and that they hadn't been \r\ntransferred to the State Archives in Dorchester. It would be foolish to drive \r\ndown the turnpike to Cambridge, cope with the commute, parking, and the \r\ncourthouse without knowing for certain that they still possessed the files I was \r\nafter. I was finally able to reach a live person at the court (don't we love the \r\nautomated answering devices and their limited menus!). \"Don\" assured me that \r\nthey indeed had the post-1871 probate files (but not pre-1871) at the Cambridge \r\ncourt, so off I went to face the commute. The Cambridge court is directly in \r\nfront of Superior Court, where all of the civil cases are heard. Access to the \r\nprobate court is from Cambridge Street, a main thoroughfare, and the Register of \r\nDeeds is conveniently located directly across the street. I was obliged to wait \r\nabout an hour as \"Don\" retrieved from another building the old dockets that I \r\nwished to review. They were then brought to me and I was able to look at the \r\noriginal documents filed in each docket. </p>\r\n<p>Having now gathered the facts from the probate court, I made plans to visit \r\nthe Wellesley town library the next day. However, there was little in the way of \r\ngenealogical materials there. The reference desk librarian was very helpful in \r\nlocating the many titles they suggested about the town's history. I was able to \r\nlook at several very small town histories, and one in particular, an \r\nenvironmental report on \"Longfellow Pond,\" really tweaked my interest. Was the \r\npond named for Nathan, or his cousin the poet? I also reviewed the <em>History of \r\nthe Town of Wellesley, Massachusetts</em> (Hon. Joseph E. Fiske) and, since \r\nWellesley was not incorporated until 1881, the <em>History of Needham \r\nMassachusetts 1711-1911</em> (George Kuhn Clarke, A.M., L.L.B., 1912). The latter \r\ncontained considerable references to the Longfellows, but the former had very \r\nlittle information. However, the <em>Annual Town Reports</em> of Needham and \r\nWellesley were of great interest to me, as they revealed the taxpayers residing \r\nin the towns and other incidental information (for instance, Nathan was paid $23 \r\nin 1859 for his service on the school committee, and $1.60 for \"gravel\" in \r\n1882). The \"gravel\" entry insinuated that he was reimbursed by the town for \r\nlaying down gravel, perhaps to improve drainage, or for a road. </p>\r\n<p>I was then off to the next town to visit the Needham Public Library because I \r\nhad concern about some loose ends. While marriage and death records were shown \r\nin the town reports (no Longfellows however), birth records were not. But the \r\ntax records I found fascinating because I was able to see the growth of Nathan's \r\nproperty, as witnessed by the acreage he owned for his pasture, the buildings \r\n(his house and barn), and the mill that he acquired from the Crane family. </p>\r\n<p>The birth records were nowhere to be found, but after further review, I began \r\nto have strong suspicions the births occurred in Maine rather than in Wellesley, \r\nas I had seen in a secondary source. However, I could now present a much broader \r\npicture of Nathan's lifestyle, by virtue of the information uncovered at these \r\nvarious repositories. I found primary records attesting to his health just \r\nbefore his death, his purchase of the mill and buildings from the Crane family, \r\nhis 24-year tenure on the school committee, and evidence that he still continued \r\nto farm his land in his retirement years. <br><br>I also found mention of three \r\nother Longfellows: A. W. Longfellow (whom I suspect was Augustus, a female), \r\nMary Longfellow, and Fannie E. Longfellow. The latter is a proven daughter of \r\nNathan's, who began teaching at age 16. But Mary Longfellow continues to baffle \r\nme, as she shows up early in the 1850s as a teacher, too early to be Nathan's \r\ndaughter. Could she possibly be a sister? I attempted to access the 1850 U.S. \r\ncensus population schedule for Needham at these libraries to see who was living \r\nin Nathan's home at that time, but was unsuccessful. I have now put that into \r\nthe \"things to do\" hopper as well, along with my plan for further research. Of \r\nspecial use and interest will be the 1855 census, which the county or town \r\nconducted, which could narrow the window considerably. Finally, there is the \r\nlingering question of Nathan's stay in Georgia. I plan to look at the 1840 \r\nAtlanta census to see if he shows up there. He may very well have had an earlier \r\nmarriage to a southern woman, and that would explain Mary Longfellow's presence \r\nin Wellesley. If so, the 1840 census will show me the number of individuals that \r\nlived in Nathan's household, which will help me reconstruct his family before he \r\nmoved to Wellesley. </p>\r\n<p>For the next phase of Longfellow research, there is clearly a need for a \r\nresearch plan, as there are many loose ends that need to be clarified.

Sharon Howland established the Washington County, Maine \r\nRecords Preservation Fund (WCMRPF), a non-profit trust fund. In addition\r\n to her role as trustee of the fund, she is the author of <em>Calais \r\nVital Records Prior to 1892</em>, <em>Records of Calais, Maine Vol. 2 \r\n(Early Vital Records, Tax Lists, Census Records)</em>, and <em>Vital \r\nRecords of Alexander, Maine</em>. She has been keenly interested in \r\npreserving and publishing the historical records of Machias, as well as \r\nother towns in the county. A working committee of the WCMRPF has been \r\nestablished with a goal of conducting an inventory of town vital, \r\ncemetery, church, and library records.

They were found during a recent real estate transaction in \r\nActon of a home that was not owned by a Farnham.&#160; My bid was successful for the \r\nfollowing ten items:</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><ol>\r\n<li><div>Ledger, measuring 8&#8221; x 6 &#189;,&#8221; detailing various trading \r\ntransactions</div></li>\r\n<li><div>Ledger, measuring 3&#190;&#8221; x 5&#190;,&#8221; also containing trading \r\ntransactions</div></li>\r\n<li><div>Original deed from Charlotte Wentworth to Paul Farnham of Shapleigh, Maine \r\n(York Co.

So there was never a question if they contained \r\n<em>unrecorded</em> transactions of any significance.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The maintenance deed (York Co. Deed 384:50) had special interest for me \r\nbecause it was a deed I did not review or abstract in my book, <em>The New \r\nEngland Descendants of the Immigrant, Ralph Farnum of Rochester, Kent County \r\nEngland and Ipswich, Massachusetts</em> (Portsmouth, NH: Peter E. Randall, \r\npublisher, 1999).&#160; </p>\r\n<p>But the ledgers of Ira Farnham also yielded interesting information. The \r\nentries concerned numerous trades (payments) of goods, while offering a window \r\ninto mid-nineteenth-century life at Acton.&#160; However, the entries do not always \r\nclearly indicate if Ira Farnham was the creditor or debtor. They appear to show \r\nmonies that were owed to him, while recording work done by debtors to pay off \r\nthe debts, but which could also be payments made by Ira to satisfy his debts. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>The smaller ledger consists of a light blue cover and eight interior pages, \r\nheld together in the center by thread.&#160; The entries in this smaller ledger \r\nconcern only John Farnham, David Horn, and Nathaniel Jewett.&#160;A sample page of \r\nthe ledger follows:</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ira Farnham 01\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Maine/ira_farnham1lg.jpg\"><img height=\"204\" border=\"0\" width=\"263\" title=\"Ira Farnham 01\" alt=\"Ira Farnham 01\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Maine/ira_farnham1lg.jpg\"></a></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><br><em>Page from the ledger of Ira Farnham<br>Click image for \r\nenlarged view<br><br></em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this image, the notation &#8220;Dr,&#8221; (debtor?) is \r\nvisible in the upper right corner of the left page.&#160; The left side would appear \r\nto list debts that were incurred by Nathaniel Jewett (i.e., Ira&#8217;s accounts \r\nreceivables).&#160; The first entry shows that Ira worked one day on March 4, 1838, \r\n&#8220;hauling logs one hand and four cattle&#8221; [10 hours], and earning $1.67.&#160; This was \r\nprobably not work done personally by Ira, but by his farmhand, using oxen \r\nbelonging to Ira. This work took place over four consecutive days.&#160;&#160; Ira&#8217;s next \r\nentry on his account with Jewett was recorded over a year later on August 29, \r\n1839. On this date he charged the same $1.67, but this time for &#8220;two days mowing \r\nfound our selves.&#8221;&#160; This probably meant Ira did the mowing himself.&#160; The \r\nfollowing year, on January 15, 1840, he charged $1.25 for &#8220;one days loging from \r\nHorns mill one hand and four cattle.&#8221; \r\n<p>The right side of the ledger is titled &#8220;To Ira Farnham&#8221; and contains similar \r\nentries.</p>\r\n<p>The larger ledger is a manufactured booklet containing interior pages of \r\nhorizontally lined paper.&#160; The dark brown hard cover and endpapers are bound \r\ntogether with glued endpapers.&#160; Some pages have been removed with a razor or \r\nother sharp instrument.&#160; A sample page is below. </p>\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ira Farnham 02\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Maine/ira_farnham2lg.jpg\"><img height=\"204\" border=\"0\" width=\"173\" title=\"Ira Farnham 02\" alt=\"Ira Farnham 02\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/Maine/ira_farnham2lg.jpg\" style=\"width: 173px; height: 204px;\"></a><br><em>Page from the ledger of Ira Farnham<br>Click image for \r\nenlarged view</em></p>\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<p>Individuals&#160;named in this larger ledger included: </p>\r\n<p>N.

But some of these \r\ndocuments also record him as a shoemaker and a millwright.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>On a separate piece of paper inserted between the pages of the ledger I found \r\na note with &#8220;Maine Side&#8221; written across the top, and the following names written \r\nbelow it: </p>\r\n<p>Mrs. W. S. Miller<br>Mrs. Wm. Pinfold<br>Mrs. James Merrone<br>Mrs. Frank \r\nHurd<br>Mrs. _ Hill<br>Mrs. C. S. Lowed [and]<br>Mrs. S. Lowed&#160; </p>\r\n<p>On the other side was written &#8220;N.H.

Hannah was second spouse of \r\nNathaniel Ham; Ellen, who was the beneficiary of Ira&#8217;s homestead as seen below \r\nin his maintenance deed, was married to Mark N. Wiggin; and Sarah was the first \r\nspouse of Josiah W. Witham.<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>&#160; Elizabeth, the second oldest daughter, never married and \r\ndied at Acton, June 20, 1916, at age 82y, 2m, 19d.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a> </p>\r\n<p>I wanted to learn more of Asa Fox and also wished to follow these families a \r\nbit further.&#160; I consulted the census and the recently published <em>Early \r\nFamilies of Shapleigh and Acton, Maine</em> (Frederick Boyle, Peter E Randall, \r\nPublisher, Portsmouth, NH, 2002). Asa was listed as a &#8220;trader&#8221; in the 1850 \r\ncensus, residing in Milton, New Hampshire.<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]</a> His family composition was:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Asa Fox, </strong>age 39 [sic], trader, with $2000 of real estate, born \r\nMaine<br><strong>Harriett W. Fox, </strong>wife, age 40, born [Shapleigh] Maine She was \r\ndaughter of Enoch and Dorothy [Heard] Wood,<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\">[4]</a> and was formerly married to a Plummer <a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a> <br><strong>Charles D.

[sic Elbridge W.] Fox, </strong>age 15, trader, born New \r\nHampshire, who apparently dropped &#8220;Enoch&#8221; in his adult life<br><strong>Asa A. Fox \r\n</strong>age 13, born New Hampshire</p>\r\n<p>Asa Fox was born October 23, 1809, the son of Daniel and Mary (Roberts) Fox, \r\nand died in Milton, New Hampshire, on September 29, 1887, at age 77y, 11m, \r\n23d,<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a> where he is buried with his wife and a number of \r\nchildren.</p>\r\n<p>Ira Farnham is found as &#8220;farmer&#8221; at the same 1850 census, residing nearby at \r\nActon, Maine.<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]</a> His family composition is as follows: </p>\r\n<p><strong>Ira Farnham, </strong>age 45, farmer, $1,500 worth of real estate, born \r\nMaine<br><strong>Sally Farnham, </strong>wife, age 45<br><strong>Hannah Farnham, </strong>age \r\n21<br><strong>Elizabeth Farnham, </strong>age 16<br><strong>Ellen Farnham, </strong>age \r\n11<br><strong>Sarah Farnham, </strong>age 5</p>\r\n<p>Living next door to Ira in 1850 was his widowed mother, Olive Farnham, age \r\n84, who was living alone in her own home.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>I went back to the census to try and locate Ira&#8217;s son-in-law [Sarah&#8217;s \r\nhusband] Josiah W. Witham, but found that was not so simple owing to the \r\nmultiple individuals found with that name.&#160; In 1850 there were two persons named \r\nJosiah Witham residing in Milton, New Hampshire, both in their thirties, and \r\n[coincidentally] one with a wife named Sarah.<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">[8]</a>&#160; But that census was of no help as Sarah and Josiah did \r\nnot marry until 1867.&#160; Moreover, Josiah was mourning the loss of Sarah who died \r\nApril 14<sup>th</sup> of that same year, surely from complications at the birth \r\nof son Clarence A. Witham in March, who himself later died in July.<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\">[9]</a> According to Boyle<em>, </em>Josiah was residing that year \r\nin nearby Wakefield,<a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\">[10]</a> but a review of that census failed to locate him.&#160; His \r\ntwo-year-old son, Ira Farnham Witham, was living with his grandfather Ira \r\nFarnham at the time. </p>\r\n<p>The maintenance deed written by Ira and his wife Sally is a common document \r\nthat specified that daughter Ellen Wiggin was to provide care for them, as well \r\nas their daughter Elizabeth Ann Farnham, for the rest of their natural lives.&#160; \r\nElizabeth was a spinster with no handicap noted in the census records.&#160; The deed \r\nspecifies that Ellen would provide them with nursing care, medicine, food and \r\nshelter, and a decent burial.&#160; In return, Ellen was to receive the homestead, \r\nwhich sat on a hundred acres in Acton, and all other buildings thereon.&#160; The \r\nacreage was described as bounded by John G. Sanborn, George N. Lord, Elias L. \r\nMiller, Josiah W. Witham, John E. Gerrish, Noah Merrow, and James Berry.&#160;&#160; Ira&#8217;s \r\npersonal estate, including a pair of oxen, one heifer, three sheep, and farming \r\ntools were part of the stipulation, which was signed by Ira and Sally before \r\nElbridge N. Fox, Justice of the Peace, on December 17, 1881.&#160; Coincidently, \r\nElbridge Fox was born December 3, 1834, the son of the trader Asa and Harriett \r\n(Wood) Fox.&#160; Because of the markings on this deed (&#8220;return to E.W.

Farnham, CG ", "country": "Maine", "title": "The Maine Old Cemetery Association", "content": "<p>In 1968, Dr. Hilda M. Fife, using the Vermont Old Cemetery Association (VOCA) as \r\na model, saw a similar need to identify small, neglected cemeteries throughout \r\nthe state of Maine. Sponsored by the Maine League of Historical Societies and \r\nMuseums and the University of Maine&#8217;s Department of History, Dr. Fife chartered \r\nthe Maine Old Cemetery Association (MOCA) as a non-profit organization.&#160; \r\nInitially, the primary purpose of MOCA was to locate old cemeteries in order to \r\nencourage their care and preservation, which would in turn aid in the \r\npreservation of historic information. Over the years MOCA has worked with scout \r\ntroops, Masons, various historical societies, and other organizations to clean \r\nup deserted and neglected cemeteries as they are identified. They also inspire \r\nand motivate local efforts by town or city officials to assist in this endeavor \r\nby calling attention to cemeteries in disrepair through local media \r\nchannels.</p>\r\n<p>As the growth of MOCA began to accelerate, programs were developed to record \r\nthe writings on tombstones in order to preserve their historical and \r\ngenealogical interest.&#160; MOCA has taken on the herculean task of recording and \r\ndocumenting the inventory of every cemetery in the state, whether large and well \r\nknown or small and well concealed. What an absolutely worthwhile goal!&#160; It is \r\nrefreshing that MOCA, in addition to recording the tombstone inscriptions, also \r\ngathers the dedicated volunteer resources necessary to accomplish this task.&#160; \r\nOnce the inscriptions are recorded, the next step is to transfer the raw \r\nmaterial into some form of permanent record and make it available to \r\nrepositories in the towns of Maine and beyond. It is a vast undertaking, made \r\neven more difficult by the condition of the stones themselves. Some tombstones \r\nare hundreds of years old and are worn due to long exposure to the environment. \r\nOlder tombstones that are not set properly become cracked and settle, or even \r\ndisappear, beneath the soil.&#160;</p>\r\n<p>There are several active MOCA projects that may be of great interest to \r\ngenealogists. They are described below.</p>\r\n<p><u><strong>Bicentennial Inscription Project (BIP)</strong></u><strong>&#160; </strong></p>\r\n<p>During the bicentennial year, MOCA received a grant for their Bicentennial \r\nInscription Project (BIP), in which they would compile information on \r\nRevolutionary War soldiers buried in Maine. The BIP covers 7,500 veterans who \r\nlived in Maine before, during, or after the war, and includes their names; dates \r\nof births, deaths, and marriages; and burial places. The data collected has been \r\nentered into a computer, printed out, and distributed amongst the following \r\nlibraries:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ancient Landmarks of Parsonfield, Route 160 </li>\r\n<li>Bangor Public Library </li>\r\n<li>Belfast Free Library </li>\r\n<li>Cutler Library, Farmington </li>\r\n<li>Fogler Library, University of Maine, Orono </li>\r\n<li>Maine Historical Society, Portland </li>\r\n<li>Maine State Library, Augusta </li>\r\n<li>Patten Free Library, Bath</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><u>MOCA Cemetery Inscription Project (MIP) </u></strong></p>\r\n<p>The MIP will hold great interest to researchers who are into &#8220;tombstone \r\nhopping,&#8221; while searching for the grave of an ancestor. This project consists of \r\nthe transcription of information from every tombstone in hundreds and hundreds \r\nof cemeteries. Before MIP was begun, researchers would generally head to larger \r\ncemeteries in hopes of finding the elusive graveyard holding the remains of an \r\nancestor. However, someone who lived far away with limited time on their hands \r\nwould be hard pressed to visit (let alone <em>find</em>) a 200-year old family \r\ncemetery in the back field of an old deserted farmhouse located a half-mile off \r\nthe Route 23 county highway road, and 100 feet beyond a cluster of oak trees and \r\nbushes, with nothing but a crude slate marker, engraved by hand, that is \r\npartially covered by the earth. Oh me!&#160; Such dedication on the part of these \r\ninspired volunteers! They give up their free time (often on weekends) because of \r\na sincere desire to preserve the final resting places of departed individuals.&#160; \r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong><u>Surname Index Project (SIP) </u></strong></p>\r\n<p>While MIP just listed the names and dates inscribed on the tombstone, the \r\nSurname Index Project went a step further. In addition to listing the available \r\ninformation from gravestones, family relationships are recorded from cemetery \r\nrecords, genealogies, etc.&#160; For example, if a tombstone read:&#160; &#8220;Mary, wife of \r\nJohn Gilbert and dau of James Jones,&#8221; Mary would be cataloged not just as Mary \r\nGilbert, but also as Mary Jones, dau of James Jones, and the names&#160;indexed \r\naccordingly.&#160; Or, if cemetery records revealed that &#8220;Gertrude Smith Jones&#160;was \r\nthe dau of John Smith,&#8221; then both John Smith and Gertrude Smith would be \r\nindexed. The Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints filmed the results of this \r\nenormous project, and a typescript copy of these several volumes, which cover \r\nevery county in Maine, has been deposited at the Maine State Library in \r\nAugusta.&#160; Researchers must search by cemetery, which means all volumes must be \r\nsearched when the location of a death is known but the cemetery is not.</p>\r\n<p><strong><u>The Marble Records</u> </strong></p>\r\n<p>These are the record books of the Marble Monument Company and its \r\npredecessors, spanning the years 1855-1918.&#160; This was a business that originated \r\nin Bath and flourished in Skowhegan, and their records contain the inscriptions \r\nof stones that were carved by the company. In addition to more than 50,000 names \r\nand address of purchasers, these records include the name of the cemetery the \r\nstones were delivered to, and in many instances, a diagram of the stone itself.&#160; \r\nThe originals of these records are kept at the Maine Historical Society in \r\nPortland, but a copy of the originals plus a computerized index will soon be \r\navailable at the Maine State Archives in Augusta. </p>\r\n<p>MOCA recognizes the need to make their enormous amount of data available to \r\nresearchers and the general public, and to that end, they have clearly defined \r\ntheir present goals and priorities.&#160; Foremost at the top of the agenda is to \r\ntransfer the mountains of handwritten, typescript, photographed, or sketched \r\ndata into the computer. While this monumental task slowly proceeds, new \r\ncemeteries continue to be discovered, requiring inventories to be taken, and \r\nbeginning the cycle over again.&#160; MOCA exists solely on the volunteers who beat \r\ndown the bushes to find new cemeteries and trudge out on their free time to \r\nwrite down inscriptions appearing on tombstones.&#160; They are anxious to develop a \r\ncore of computer literate individuals who could provide valuable and much-needed \r\nassistance from the comfort of their own homes.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Two of the largest counties in Maine have been completely inventoried and \r\ncomputerized.&#160; Within the past six years, MOCA has published four volumes of the \r\n<em>Maine Cemetery Inscriptions, York County</em>, containing 107,277 entries \r\n(Augusta, ME: MOCA, 1995), and the latest, <em>Maine Cemetery Inscriptions, \r\nKennebec County </em>(Rockport, ME: Picton Press, 2000), in six volumes, \r\ncontaining 135,094 entries. The latter title is also available on CD.&#160; The \r\nKennebec volumes ($399) can be acquired from the publisher; however, the York \r\nCounty volumes ($260) and the Kennebec CD ($99) are available directly from MOCA \r\n(P.O. Box 641, Augusta, ME 04332-0641).&#160; The indices to more than a quarter \r\nmillion names are without regard to the location of the cemetery, but the \r\ninterior pages are arranged first by town and then by cemetery, enabling a \r\nresearcher to conveniently view all cemeteries within a town or city.&#160; \r\nPurchasing these highly acclaimed publications directly from MOCA enables them \r\nto recapture the large sums of money initially advanced to publish these \r\nbeautiful volumes. </p>\r\n<p>It is estimated that more than 75% of the inventory of Maine cemeteries has \r\nbeen completed.&#160; Typescript volumes for every county in Maine are on file at the \r\nMaine State Archives.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Membership in the Maine Old Cemetery Association is open to the public for a \r\nmere $5 per year, or $20 for five years, with lifetime membership available for \r\n$100.&#160; A nifty quarterly newsletter is mailed to members, whose numbers are \r\nheading toward the 1000 mark.&#160; Questions regarding MOCA &#8220;look-ups,&#8221; \r\nvolunteering, new cemeteries or those being neglected, speakers, membership, or \r\nany matter of interest, may wish to contact: </p>\r\n<p>Cheryl Patten, President&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>RR#1, Box \r\n2980&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Smithfield, ME \r\n04978&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<br>Tel: 207-634-2156 </p>\r\n<p>Roland Jordan, Treasurer<br>42 Hector St.<br>Auburn, ME 04210<br>Tel: \r\n207-784-3338</p>\r\n<p>Researchers may write to MOCA at the following address or visit their <a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.com/~memoca/moca.htm\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> \r\n:&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>\r\n<p>Maine Old Cemetery Association<br>P.O.

Taylor", "country": "Massachusetts", "title": "Ancestral History in Massachusetts", "content": "<p>Genealogical research fills in the branches on your family \r\ntree, but does it help you understand your ancestors&#8217; daily lives in \r\nMassachusetts?&#160; Probably not. Social history picks up where records research \r\nends and enables you to learn about the times in which your ancestors lived. \r\nRe-creating their lives is an exciting pursuit and can actually uncover new \r\navenues of research for you to add to your family tree. Social history is the \r\nstudy of everyday life and in order to learn more about your relatives you will \r\nwant to look at photographs of people and places as well as study their \r\nhometowns, jobs, and what their home life was like. Here are some time-tested \r\nways to do just that.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>Start by creating a timeline of the facts of their lives, \r\nsuch as when they were born and married, and when they died. Include school \r\nattendance, year of immigration, dates they changed towns of residence and, of \r\ncourse, birth dates for their children. Then find out what was happening during \r\nthose years, both in the towns in which they lived and in terms of world events. \r\nPlot those items on your timeline. The goal is to make your ancestor a real \r\nperson, so immerse yourself in the history and culture of their lives. It will \r\ngive you a whole new appreciation of those branches on your tree. It doesn&#8217;t \r\ntake a PBS reality show like <em>1900</em> to find out the details &#8212; just a sense \r\nof curiosity, library research, and some time to read. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Timeline Helps </strong></p>\r\n<p>A good resource for world events is <em>The Timetables of \r\nHistory</em> by Bernard Grun and Daniel Boorstin (Touchstone Books, 1991).&#160; For \r\nlocal events, read local histories or newspapers. Public libraries in \r\nMassachusetts have materials on the history of the areas they represent and some \r\nhave copies of their town newspapers. The Boston Public Library (www.bpl.org) \r\nhas a complete collection of all newspapers published in Massachusetts. A list \r\nof ethnic newspapers appears on the <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.bostonfamilyhistory.com/\">Boston Family History \r\n</a>website. If you don&#8217;t live in the area, consult their online catalog and see \r\nif your public library can help you obtain what you need through inter-library \r\nloan. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Finding Photographs </strong></p>\r\n<p>Once again, public libraries come to the rescue with their \r\nlocal history collections. Start there or use Elizabeth Petty Bentley&#8217;s \r\n<em>Genealogists Address Book</em> (GPC, 1998) to find a historical society near \r\nwhere your ancestors lived. Consult an earlier Massachusetts column in this \r\nseries, &#8220;Often-Overlooked Massachusetts Repositories&#8221; for some useful links. If \r\nyou are looking for photographs of localities, try searching the expansive \r\ndigital collection online at the <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.loc.gov/\">Library of Congress American Memory </a>site. The <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.arcadiapublishing.com/\">Arcadia Publishing Company \r\n</a>specializes in illustrated histories and many Massachusetts towns are \r\nalready included in their imprint under the Images of America series. Arcadia&#8217;s \r\nwebsite contains a list of what titles are available through most booksellers. \r\nAbove all, don&#8217;t forget to ask relatives for images! </p>\r\n<p>Use your genealogical research skills to discover when a \r\npicture was taken by researching when a photographer was in business or by \r\nstudying the clothing clues. Images can even provide you with a sense of your \r\nancestors&#8217; personality based on their attention to fashion or their stance. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Examine Artifacts </strong></p>\r\n<p>Learning about daily life involves more than just researching \r\nthe time period; it also involves looking at items that your ancestors owned &#8212; \r\nscrapbooks, silver, clothing, furniture, quilts, and myriad other objects. Those \r\nartifacts tell you something about what was important to your ancestors and \r\nprovide clues to uncover their lives. <em>Antiques Roadshow</em> examines items to \r\ndetermine their value as historical artifacts, but often there are materials \r\npassed down through several generations that have added value to the family \r\nhistorian. Consult Joe L. Rosson and Helaine Fendelman&#8217;s <em>Treasures in Your \r\nAttic</em> (Harper Collins, 2001) for additional information. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Historical Context </strong></p>\r\n<p>There are some great books to help you understand the times \r\nin which your ancestors lived. Type Massachusetts into an online bookstore \r\nsearch engine and you&#8217;ll discover thousands of books either about the state or \r\nusing it as a location for a work of fiction. Children&#8217;s books provide a quick \r\noverview of the history of Massachusetts, supplying the basics without \r\noverwhelming you with details. A good example is Sylvia McNair&#8217;s \r\n<em>Massachusetts</em>, part of the &#8220;America the Beautiful&#8221; series (Children&#8217;s \r\nPress, 1998). If you want a book intended for adults, read the informative \r\n<em>Massachusetts: A Concise History</em> by Richard D. Brown and Jack Tager \r\n(University of Massachusetts Press, 2000). Christopher Kenneally&#8217;s <em>The \r\nMassachusetts Legacy: 150 Landmark Events that Shaped Our Nation</em> (Adams \r\nPublishing, 1995) spotlights events in Massachusetts history in which your \r\nancestors might have participated.&#160; To find timelines on Boston neighborhoods \r\nand some ethnic groups consult <a href=\"http://www.bostonfamilyhistory.com/\">www.bostonfamilyhistory.com</a>. </p>\r\n<p>There are also titles that focus on a particular time period. \r\nIf your ancestors came over on the <em>Mayflower</em> then a must-read is <em>The \r\nTimes of Their Lives &#8212; Life, Love and Death in Plymouth Colony</em>, by James C. \r\nDeetz and Patricia Scott Deetz (W.H. Freeman, 2000). Boston&#8217;s role in the Civil \r\nWar is covered in Thomas H. O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s <em>Civil War Boston: Home Front and \r\nBattlefield</em> (Northeastern, 1999). The fact is that there are plenty of \r\nchoices if you are trying to set your ancestors in historical context for a \r\nwritten genealogy or attempting to discover a fact that might lead to new \r\ngenealogical discoveries. Use the following checklist to get the most out of \r\nyour research. </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Use online card catalogs to find appropriate publications \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Ask your local reference department staff at your public \r\nlibrary for help when you can&#8217;t find the book you need. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Borrow books from the NEHGS Circulating Library (It&#8217;s a \r\nmembership benefit!) </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Use the Web </strong></p>\r\n<p>Find information 24/7 by using your Internet connection. Type \r\na topic into an online search engine like google.com and see what turns up. Be \r\nas specific as possible when looking for information online. A very general \r\nsearch for &#8220;Massachusetts history&#8221; revealed more than 10,000 sites with \r\npertinent information! Many of these hits were sites created by cities and towns \r\nthat included historical data.&#160; One interesting site for Boston is <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.iboston.org/\">Boston History and Architecture \r\n</a>,&#160;which has a Boston-specific &#8220;this day in history&#8221; as well as trip-planning \r\ntips. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Step Back in Time </strong></p>\r\n<p>There are a plethora of museums in Massachusetts that allow \r\nvisitors to time travel. Of course, there is the world-renowned <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.freedomtrail.org/\">Freedom Trail </a>that lets \r\nvisitors walk through three centuries of Boston history, but I&#8217;ll bet you can \r\nfind a historical museum that covers some aspect of your ancestor&#8217;s life. Below \r\nare a couple examples to start you on your way. </p>\r\n<p><a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.osv.org/\">Old Sturbridge \r\nVillage<br></a>Experience early nineteenth-century village life in western \r\nMassachusetts where guides answer your questions about their daily life and \r\noccupations. </p>\r\n<p><a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.plimoth.org/Museum/museum.htm\">Plimoth Plantation<br></a>According to their website, it is always \r\n1627 at this living history museum featuring interpretive guides. Step back in \r\ntime and even meet some of your <em>Mayflower</em> ancestors. </p>\r\n<p>There are so many ways to make your family more than just \r\nnames and dates on your family tree. Katherine Scott Sturdevant&#8217;s <em>Bringing \r\nYour Family History to Life Through Social History </em>(Betterway, 2000) offers \r\nadditional suggestions for making your ancestors real people.&#160; Have fun with \r\nyour pursuit by trying ethnic foods, exploring neighborhoods, or even listening \r\nto period music. You might discover you have more in common with your ancestors \r\nthan you could imagine. </p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/ancestral-history-in-massachusetts/", "published": "May 16, 2003", "id": 232}, {"author": "Ann Smith Lainhart", "country": "Massachusetts", "title": "Boston in Print, Part 2: Town Records and Annexed Lands", "content": "<p>This is the second of three columns covering sources that can be useful when \r\nresearching people who have lived in Boston.

The biggest drawback \r\nto using these other volumes is that they are mostly indexed by surname only. If \r\nyou are dealing with one of the larger families in Boston, this can mean a lot \r\nof pages to check! But I encourage you to do so. With so many New England town \r\nrecords not in print, or only on microfilm in the old handwriting, or not even \r\nyet microfilmed, these published Boston records should not be overlooked by \r\nanyone with Boston ancestry.</p>\r\n<p>As with most town records, you may not find the answers to genealogical \r\nquestions like who was John's father or what was Mary's maiden name, but you may \r\nfind some very interesting biographical details which will help you to \r\nunderstand how your ancestors lived. Here are some random examples; the first \r\nthree are from minutes of the selectmen's meetings and the last three from \r\nminutes of town meetings:</p>\r\n<p>11 Jan 1765</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Mr Langdon Usher at the North Grammar School being still confined to his \r\nHouse by means of Bodily disorder the Select men this Day Agreed with Mr Andrew \r\nEliot Junr to serve the school in that capacity for one Month.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>17 Jun 1767</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Thomas Littlewood (?), from London last from Philadelphia came ye 19. of \r\nApril last appeared and asked liberty of the Selectmen to open a Shop in this \r\nTown adjoining The Probate Office for the carrying on the business of a Silk \r\nDyer - whereupon Voted, that he have liberty.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>14 Sep 1768</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Mr Paul Farmer was directed to receive into the Alms house by two of the \r\nSelectmen - vizt - Joseph Jackson &amp; John Ruddock, to be supported there at \r\nthe public charge one Richard Swansbury, a Stranger &amp; not an Inhabitant of \r\nany Town in this Province nor having wherewithall to support \r\nhimself.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>2 Feb 1779</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>The Committee of seven appointed, to Enquire into the Conduct of Forestallers \r\nEngrossers and Monopolizers, and to ascertain Facts - Reported in part: That one \r\nSampson Reed a Stranger is suspected of Engrossing and Forestalling the \r\nNecessaries of Life - that in a particular Manner he has monopolized a great \r\nquantity of Glass.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>12 Mar 1798</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>What steps shall be taken to prevent dead Carcasses being thrown into the \r\nMill Pond - was read - whereupon moved &amp; Voted, that Honble Thomas Dawes \r\nEsq., William Cooper, John Warren Esq., William Eustis Esq., a Committee \r\nrelative to Health be a Committee to consider &amp; Report \r\nthereon.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>9 Apr 1804</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>The Request of William Tudor, Harrison G.

It shows \r\nthat Benjamin Gillam was an early shipwright and owned parts of more than one \r\nship, that he served the town, owned land with a house and wharf, probably had a \r\nson Benjamin since they are called junior and senior, and may be related to a \r\nRobert and an Edward Gillam. This material comes from seven of the Reports \r\nvolumes and I have put them all into one chronological list:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1637 25 Sep </strong><br>Also Robert Gillam, marryner, hath leave to buy a \r\nhouseplott where he can.<br><strong>8 Jan </strong><br>The great Allottments at Rumley \r\nMarsh and Pullen Point.<br>Beniamyn Gillam, eight and twenty acrs: bounded on \r\nthe South with Thomas Matson; on the West with Mr Keine; and on the North with \r\nJohn Gallopp; and on the East with the highway.<br><strong>1638 16 Apr </strong><br>Also \r\nthat all fence about the Corne feilds shalbe sufficiently made, according to \r\nCourt order...And to be seene unto by these men...Beniamyn Gillam.<br><strong>1639 25 \r\nMar </strong><br>Also it is ordered that all the Cornefeild fences about the Towne \r\nshalbe made sufficient before the eight day of this next 2d moneth...about the \r\nfort feild by or brethren Beniamyn Gillam.<br><strong>1640 30 Mar </strong><br>...and \r\nlikewise Beniamin Gillam and Edmund Jackson for the Fort feild.<br><strong>20 Apr \r\n23</strong><br>John Odline is to have 8 Acres of marsh at muddie River for L4...Ben. \r\nGillum 10 Acrs for L5.<br><strong>1645 10 Dec </strong><br>A bond of 1000ii wherein Adam \r\nWinthrop &amp; Benjamin gillom are bound to Emanuel Downeing Joshua ffoote \r\nStephen Winthrop &amp; Thomas Bell to prepare 100 Masts of white pine or \r\nspruise.<br><strong>1646 1 Dec </strong><br>An Attest to a Copie of a Bill of sale of one \r\nfourth part of the Unity of Boston wththappurtenances from Benjamin Gillom to \r\nJohn Leverit.<br><strong>1647 23 Aug </strong><br>Mr Adam Winthrop constitued Isaac \r\nAllerton of New haven his Attnr to aske &amp;c: a debt of twelve pounds sterl \r\npayable in Bever to himself &amp; Benjamin Gillom.<br><strong>23 Sep </strong><br>Benjamin \r\nGillam ordered Thomas Bell to pay his Bills of Exchange to John Parke or his \r\nassignes out of the pduce of his pt of the Cargo.<br><strong>30 Oct </strong><br>I \r\ntestifyed under my hand a Copie of a Bill of sale of so much as comes to two \r\nhundrd &amp; fifty pounds of the Ship Expectation &amp; her Cargo, from John \r\nTurner &amp; Benjamin Gillom to Stephen &amp; Adam Winthrop.<br><strong>1648 \r\n</strong><br>Benjamin Gillom his possession within the limits of Boston.<br>One house \r\nand garden bounded with Benjamin Ward on the west; Mr Wm Hibbins south; John \r\nCompton and the Cove east; and the marsh north.

Emer O'Keefe (1999)</p>\r\n<p>From the introduction:</p>\r\n<p>\"The destruction of the potato crop four years in succession caused Ireland's \r\npopulation to decline from 8.2 million in 1841 to 6.5 million in 1851.&#160; While \r\nIreland was emptying, Boston was filling with Irish immigrants, showing a \r\nten-year increase of 105 percent.&#160; From 1846 to 1849, 100,000 Irish persons \r\narrived in Boston.&#160; Most immigrants would expect to obtain their first \r\nemployment through family networks of siblings, uncles, nephews and sons who had \r\npreceded them to America.&#160; Ireland was a society in which obligations and claims \r\namong kin were extremely powerful and disregarded only at the cost of severing \r\nfamily ties permanently.&#160; However, many immigrants would discover after arrival \r\nthat it was not enough to know only the name of the town where they had last \r\nheard from their relative.&#160; America was a much larger country than the new \r\narrivals could ever have imagined, and following the employment trail could \r\neasily take them hundreds of miles from where they had begun.\"</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, many Irish turned to the <em>Boston Pilot</em> and placed \r\nadvertisements to try and locate their missing relatives and friends.&#160; Almost \r\nall of these entries identify specific places in Ireland where they came from.&#160; \r\nWhile the persons inquiring and those being looked for can be from all over the \r\ncountry, many are from Boston or passed through Boston as these examples \r\nshow:</p>\r\n<p>Of EDWARD TIERNEY, native of Newtown, parish of Burriscarra, co. Mayo, who \r\nlanded in Boston in the Spring of 1848.&#160; He left Boston in May, 1849, for \r\nVermont in company with Martin Foy and Patrick Coulter, and not heard from \r\nsince.&#160; Any information respecting him will be thankfully received by his \r\nbrother, THOMAS TIERNEY, Hopkinton, Massachusetts.</p>\r\n<p>Of PATRICK KELLY, a native of Dublin, who came to this country in June, 1849 \r\n- landed in Boston - when last heard from was at No. 63 Atkinson street, \r\nBoston.&#160; Any information respecting him will be thankfully received by JOHN \r\nQUIN, care of S.S. Thompson, Lancaster, N.H.</p>\r\n<p>TIMOTHY B. MURPHY and son, JOHN ENGLAND MURPHY, left Pittsburgh 11th April, \r\n1846.&#160; He was a mathematical teacher.&#160; When last heard of was in Glenburine, 5 \r\nmiles from Kingston, Upper Canada, teaching school.&#160; The Boy is going on 15 \r\nyears old.&#160; Any information respecting them will be thankfully received by his \r\nwife &amp; younger son.&#160; Direct to MARGARET H.

Even one that is cracked, worn, and lichen-covered -- but still mostly readable -- is a triumph. On the other hand, many times we must make do with someone else's view. Yet even finding a written record can mean a giant step back in our family history.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p><strong>Cemetery Records Come in Various Forms</strong><br>Obviously there are the stones themselves. Then there are transcriptions of the stones. Thirdly there are records kept by those who maintain the cemeteries. A few words about each: </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>If you are planning to visit a cemetery, take along a clipboard and paper, a tape recorder or perhaps your laptop. A folding chair gives you a lap. Bring a camera (black and white film works very well), a mirror, and someone to be company in a lonely place and to hold the mirror so that the light casts shadows in the letters, making them stand out clearly. If you are tempted to bring along shaving cream, chalk, or rubbing materials, read about the subject first (rubbings can be harmful to the stones if improperly done). If there is someone you can contact to help you find the location of the graves, do so. Be sure to ask permission if it is on private property. Ask permission also before cutting briars or digging around the stone. In fact, read a few articles on cemetery research. Marcia Melnyk's is particularly entertaining and informative (see below). </li>\r\n<li>Transcriptions of headstones vary. It's a good idea to look at several for the same cemetery if you can find more than one. Older is probably better, because stones may have disappeared. But the format and detail may vary. I have photocopies of a very old transcription of a rather large cemetery. Each name is followed by the years of birth and death. When I had occasion to visit the cemetery I discovered that the stones usually included full death dates and that the birth years had been calculated from the age at death. Only the older stones were transcribed. Other words on the stones, usually indicating relationships, had been omitted. But one good thing about the transcript was that the names were listed as the transcriber walked through the cemetery. Alphabetical transcriptions are easier to search, but they lose the relationships within groups, even between husband and wife. </li>\r\n<li>Cemetery offices, or sometimes town clerks, will have their own records. My experience is that the official will rarely let the genealogist browse through the records, but generally they are willing to search and make copies. Photocopies are, of course, better than handwritten notes. They may ask a fee, which is reasonable because they are employees, and someone is paying for their time. If you can, view the gravestones themselves. I spoke with someone at a Springfield cemetery office on the phone who said they could tell me where the stone I wanted was and advised me to come when the office was open. When I had occasion to be in the Connecticut River valley on a Sunday afternoon (when the office was closed), my son and I walked that huge cemetery for an hour or more and never did find that little child's stone. On the other hand, some years ago I went to a cemetery office looking for my great-grandmother's sister's grave. The office insisted she was not buried there. So I asked about her parents. Yes, they were buried right outside the office door. I walked out around Jeremiah's plot and there was the stone I'd been looking for, as solid and legible as one could wish. </li>\r\n<li>Cemetery office records will also include information on ownership of plots. </li>\r\n<li>Funeral home records are another resource that, if located, would be very helpful. Occasionally you will find them on Family History Library microfilm.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Even though you find two or three transcriptions of gravestones, it is still important, if you possibly can, to visit the cemetery itself, or at least get photographs of the stones. Recently I used a very nice transcription, by Esther Whitcomb, listed below. It gave me the maiden name of Pierson T. Kendall's first wife, Lucinda Kilburn. Wanting to know more about her, I checked Worcester County probate records and found a guardianship for a Lucinda Kilburn. This led to Wendell in Franklin County, where her father was a minister and left a nice probate record identifying his daughter. Months later I finally visited the cemetery in Sterling and found to my astonishment that her gravestone not only named her parents but also said they lived in Wendell! The other records were still worth finding, but if she had not inherited property from her grandfather in Worcester County, I would not have found her parents via that route. The moral of that tale is that if you are compiling a transcription of gravestones, please include all the information on the stone.</p>\r\n<p>The same row of gravestones also confirmed that her son Charles B. Kendall was indeed the man of that name who had died in 1876. Since the transcription was in alphabetical order, I had not been able to tell whether Charles B. belonged in that particular family.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How Does One Find Cemetery Records in Massachusetts?</strong><br>The answer to that question is about to get a lot easier. David Lambert, an NEHGS librarian, has been compiling his <em>Guide to Cemeteries Located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts</em> for about twelve years now and plans to publish this year. This will include not only information about the cemeteries themselves, but also a great many references to published transcriptions and manuscripts. In the meantime, there are other avenues. </p>\r\n<p>To locate a cemetery itself, many of the suggestions below for locating transcripts will be helpful. But it may be a good idea first to locate the land where the person lived. If you discover he lived near the edge of a town or county, it will be a good idea to look in neighboring jurisdictions. Good topographical maps will include cemeteries on them. Newspaper death notices may mention a cemetery. The town clerk, an historical society, or reference librarian can refer you to the cemetery commission or office.</p>\r\n<p>Consider both the time when the individual died and his or her religious affiliation. Early residents will probably be in old cemeteries, but not necessarily. Graves have often been moved. In Massachusetts the most dramatic example is when the Quabbin Reservoir displaced many old cemeteries. Both vital and cemetery records of the extinct towns are at the Dam Headquarters.</p>\r\n<p>Cemeteries may be known by two or three different names. I went into the Athol library one day many years ago, pointed to the name of a cemetery in the published Athol vital records and asked, \"Where is it?\" No one knew. Try the local historical society or ask until you find a knowledgeable person.</p>\r\n<p>To locate transcriptions of gravestones or other types of cemetery records: </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>In the NEHGS library, check all catalogs, particularly a small \"Typescript Catalog\" behind the desk on the 5th floor. This has a main section and another small section of items that have LC [Library of Congress] numbers. </li>\r\n<li>In the <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\" target=\"_new\">Family History Library Catalog</a> look under the category \"cemeteries\" in three places: town, county, and state. Check also under the Daughters of the American Revolution as author. </li>\r\n<li>Many cemetery records have been published in genealogical journals. Look in PERSI (the Periodical Source Index) at Ancestry.com. Searching under \"Location and Record Type\" in the 1999 release on CD-ROM revealed that there are 369 entries for \"Massachusetts\" and \"cemetery\" or \"cemeteries.\" </li>\r\n<li>Try the <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/catalog/\" target=\"_new\">Library of Congress</a> . Many local town clerks or historical societies have transcripts, often annotated by local historians. </li>\r\n<li>Town histories and published vital records often contain cemetery records. The \"Official Series\" of vital records designates a cemetery record as \"G.R.,\" keyed to the list of abbreviations in the front of the book. </li>\r\n<li>And don't forget David Lambert's book, discussed above.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Some More Helpful References</strong><br>On cemetery records in general: </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li><em>The AGS Quarterly</em>, formerly the <em>Association for Gravestone Studies Newsletter</em> makes for interesting reading.

The Bay Colony having been \r\nfounded partly for religious reasons, church records begin early in our state. \r\nBut while many church records are readily available, others can be frustratingly \r\ndifficult to find.<br><br><strong>What sort of information can be found in church \r\nrecords?</strong><br><br>The earliest church records in Massachusetts are those of \r\nthe Congregational Church. There are also early Episcopal records, but Quakers \r\nand Baptists were <em>personae non grata </em>in the Commonwealth, and many fled \r\nto Rhode Island. By the nineteenth century, though, we have the whole array of \r\ndenominations. Different churches, of course, kept different kinds of records. \r\nWhile Congregationalists recorded infant baptisms, Baptists, to whom this \r\npractice was anathema, recorded only baptisms of youths and adults. \r\nEpiscopalians and Lutherans often recorded confirmations, sometimes along with \r\nbirth or baptism dates.<br><br>Besides baptisms, you will frequently find both \r\nmarriage and death or burial records. In early colonial days, marriages were not \r\nusually a religious ceremony, so churches did not usually record them. As for \r\ndeaths, it is often difficult to tell whether the date given is that of the \r\ndeath or of the burial. The difference could be important in some cases. While a \r\nchild's baptism suggests that at least one of the parents was a church member, \r\ndeath records might be for anyone in the community.<br><br>Membership records \r\nare another important source of information. Sometimes notices of admission and \r\ndismission appear in the records of church meetings. If a new member was \r\nadmitted by letter from another church, you can often learn where that \r\nindividual came from. Members were sometimes dismissed to other named churches \r\nor towns. Annotated membership lists can prove to be a treasure. Sometimes a \r\ndeath date was be added, or the married surname of a woman who joined as a \r\nteenager. Sometimes these member records have been published in \"Manuals\" of the \r\nchurch. They can be found in libraries and historical societies. The original \r\nrecords may contain more detail.<br><br>The minutes of church meetings may also \r\nprove useful. All sorts of business was transacted in the meetings. The most \r\ninteresting matters are usually disciplinary cases for everything from \r\nnon-attendance to profanity, drunkenness, and fornication, but you will also \r\nfind mention of people elected to office, paid for sweeping or repairing the \r\nmeetinghouse, or permitted to build a pew. Often the church itself was a \r\nseparate organization from the society that maintained the building and sold the \r\npews. These latter records may be included in the town records. Those who argue \r\ntoday over separation of church and state seem to be ignorant of the fact that \r\nthe Congregational Church was the established church of the Commonwealth of \r\nMassachusetts until 1833. The First Amendment evidently applied to Congress, not \r\nto the states.<br><br><strong>How does one find church records in \r\nMassachusetts?</strong><br><br>Records of any particular Massachusetts church might \r\nbe found in any number of places and in different formats. The original records \r\nmay be at the church itself, in the town clerk's vault, or in an institution \r\nsuch as the Congregational Library in Boston, the Archives of the Archdiocese of \r\nBoston, the Harvard Divinity School Library, the American Antiquarian Society in \r\nWorcester, or the Massachusetts Historical Society. You need to locate a central \r\ndepository for that denomination.<br><br>Records may have been published or \r\nmicrofilmed. Transcriptions are often on deposit in any number of places. \r\nAbstracts may have been published in books, periodicals, and on microfilm; some \r\nmay reside in libraries as manuscripts. Published abstracts will probably also \r\nbe indexed. It's usually a good idea to look for a published transcription or \r\nabstract of the records first. That gives you the assistance of a transcriber \r\nwho was probably very familiar with the handwriting and organization of the \r\noriginal records. Then if you feel you need to look at the original, you have a \r\nhead start.

Although few complete transcriptions of all records for a given \r\nchurch have been published, a journal may have published part of them verbatim \r\nor, more frequently, abstracts of baptisms, marriages, etc. The NEHG \r\n<em>Register</em> for example, published a new-found volume of Swansea Baptist \r\nChurch records in vol. 139 (January 1985). \r\n</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://lcweb.loc.gov/coll/nucmc/\" target=\"_new\">National Union \r\nCatalog of Manuscript Collections </a>(NUCMC) \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Any other promising library or historical society. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Many of the published volumes of town vital records include church records of \r\nbaptism, marriage, and death. However, in the \"official series\" (see <a title=\"my previous  column\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=15728&amp;libID=15734\">my previous  column</a> on vital records) it appears that such records were included only \r\nwhen there was no corresponding record in town records or when the church record \r\ndiffered in some way. For example, the children of Nicholas Harris appear in the \r\npublished Wrentham vital records, most of them with birth date, but a few with \r\nonly baptismal date. All of them, however, appear in baptism records of the \r\noriginal Church of Christ in Wrentham.<br><br>Finding the original records of \r\nthe church will take some detective work. Many churches have deposited their \r\nolder records in an institution that has a vault: a denominational archive, a \r\nlibrary, historical society, or even a bank. The easiest way to find them is \r\nprobably to contact someone in the town: the church itself, a reference \r\nlibrarian, the town clerk, or a local historian. Do not take \"There are none\" \r\nfor a final answer until you are certain you are talking with someone who really \r\nknows. Recently I had occasion to look at the records of a small town. Having \r\nchecked with Worthley's inventory of Congregational Church records (cited \r\nbelow), I knew, or thought I knew, that they should be in the town clerk's \r\nvault. Over the phone the town clerk told me she did not have them. The church \r\nsecretary had no idea where they were. Needing a look at town records as well, I \r\nwent to the clerk's office anyway. Eventually she let me look in the vault \r\nmyself, and there, in a small black metal box in a very awkward place, I found \r\nthe church records. </p>\r\n<p class=\"web-body-indent\">Sometimes the church is no longer in existence. In this \r\ncase, if the references given below fail you, a local historian may still be the \r\nbest person to check with. Churches often merged, and the present church office \r\nmay have the records. If not, the records may have ended up in the vault of an \r\ninstitution. Local and county histories usually provide some history of the \r\nchurches, but they may or may not mention what has become of the records. City \r\ndirectories can help you pinpoint the name and location of churches.<br><br>You \r\nwill find the following references helpful: </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>See all the materials discussed in the first column of this series, \r\nparticularly the <em><a href=\"http://pictonpress.com/store/show/1856\" target=\"_blank\">Genealogist's Handbook for New England Research</a></em><em>,</em> \r\n4th ed., pp. 114-16.

Taylor", "country": "Massachusetts", "title": "Coming Home to New England: Creating a Family History Itinerary", "content": "<p>In 1899, New Hampshire Governor Frank West Rollins began a trend. He \r\ninaugurated &#8220;Old Home Week.&#8221; It was a reunion occasion billed to people \r\nas &#8220;an opportunity to come back to their old homes and meet once more \r\ntheir old friends and schoolmates.&#8221;<sup>1</sup> Within a few years \r\nMaine, Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island all followed suit. An \r\neditorial in the <em>New England Magazine</em> explained the importance \r\nof the event, &#8220;If only a small percentage of New England&#8217;s absent \r\nnatives can be induced to come back and settle down among us again, if \r\nmerely in the capacity of summer visitors, something will have been \r\naccomplished toward counteracting the drain upon our resources that we \r\nare now feeling so seriously.&#8221;<sup>2</sup> So many people left New \r\nEngland for other areas of the country that the region suffered economic\r\n consequences. Rollins idea was an attempt to reverse that trend. It was\r\n successful. <br><br>People returned to New England. They came for Old \r\nHome Week, summer vacations and because they connected with family \r\nhistory. There are no statistics on how many decided to stay, but those \r\nthat visited endowed public drinking fountains, public libraries, and \r\nleft behind tablets and monuments to their ancestors. <br><br>Old Home \r\nWeek was a great idea. While a few towns still honor the event, most \r\nhave forgotten it ever happened. Why wait until your ancestral hometown \r\nresurrects that reunion feeling. Create your own. <br><br>My family is \r\nfrom Rhode Island for several generations so if I get homesick I get in \r\nmy car and drive across the border. It takes less than an hour for me to\r\n revisit childhood places and reminisce. I&#8217;m lucky. I still live close \r\nto the places most of my ancestors called home, but that doesn&#8217;t mean \r\ntheir neighborhoods still look the same. To really get a sense of the \r\nplaces they lived, worked and played it&#8217;s necessary to create a \r\npersonalized family history itinerary. It&#8217;s not as difficult as you \r\nmight think. As a genealogist you can put your research skills to work \r\nto chart a trip into ancestral New England.<br><br><strong>Family \r\nHistory is the Key</strong><br><br>Start by making a list of all the \r\nplaces your ancestors lived and when. Those place names probably appear \r\nin the genealogical documents you&#8217;ve accumulated&#8212;court records, census \r\ndocuments, city directories and more. Next organize them by surname (for\r\n a family specific trip) or by place name for a more general family \r\nhistory tour. As you probably know the types of records your ancestor \r\ncreated and the information recorded depends on when they lived. You can\r\n plan your trip using the following resources: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Early census records mention the head of household, but by the \r\ntwentieth century all sorts of data appear on the enumerations including\r\n street addresses. Search federal census records online using \r\nAncestry.com or HeritageQuest.com or use microfilm at libraries like \r\nNEHGS and the National Archives.<br><br></li>\r\n<li>City directories list exact street addresses and often occupations \r\nallowing you to schedule the street on which your ancestor lived into \r\nyour itinerary. House numbers and street names are often changed so look\r\n carefully at directories to see if there is any information in the \r\nfront on street renumbering or renaming. Most New England city \r\ndirectories are on microfilm at research facilities across the country \r\nincluding the NEHGS library. Ancestry.com is in the process of expanding\r\n their online directory collection. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Nineteenth and twentieth century maps like Beers Atlases contain \r\ndots signifying houses with surnames beside them. When visiting a town \r\nin New Hampshire where family once lived in the early nineteenth century\r\n I asked a town historian to help me find their neighborhood. All the \r\nhouses were gone replaced by a development, but then she showed me a \r\nmid-nineteenth century map and there they were. A mere dot, but it meant\r\n a lot to get a sense of the area when they lived there. Other \r\nnineteenth and twentieth century maps are in electronic format.

Travel \r\ndiaries present first person accounts of trips; published guidebooks \r\nresemble familiar favorites like Fodor&#8217;s while even gazetteers add a few\r\n extra bits of information to personalize an itinerary. <br><br><ul>\r\n<li><em>Diaries and Letters</em><br><br>Perhaps your ancestor kept a \r\njournal of their trip cross country or sent letters home describing it. \r\nCheck with family to locate documents and turn to the National Union \r\nCatalog of Manuscript Collections (NUMUC) to search for others.

For instance, Sarah Kemble \r\nKnight left Boston for a five month round trip to New York in 1704. Her \r\ndiary mentions road conditions and accommodations. You can view it \r\nonline at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6524/\">History Matters</a>.

They offer a variety of motor and foot itineraries of \r\nhighlighted sites and short histories of the towns and places. In \r\naddition to what you&#8217;ll see along the way is interesting trivia and \r\nliterary references. For instance, in the Rhode Island volume under \r\nNewport site 22, (3 Pelham St on the corner of Thames St.) &#8220;is a marker \r\nindicating the house in front of which David Melville placed gas lights \r\nin 1806, the first installation of the kind in the country.&#8221;<sup>3</sup>\r\n These guides are available in public libraries through interlibrary \r\nloan or can be purchased through used book dealers. Beverly Rice, CG \r\ndescribes these useful books in &#8220;A Look Back in Time: The American Guide\r\n Series&#8221; in the <em>Association of Professional Genealogists Quarterly</em>\r\n (APGQ).<sup>4</sup> Sometimes it&#8217;s fun to follow these old tours and \r\nsee what&#8217;s the same and what&#8217;s different.<br><br></li>\r\n<li><em>Gazetteers</em><br>One of my favorite books is a well-worn copy \r\nof Lippincott&#8217;s 1884 <em>Gazetteer of the World</em> I purchased at a \r\nused book sale.

I know it&#8217;s not a guidebook \r\nbut the listings help me imagine the past providing the number of \r\nresidents to the chief industries. Every year I visit Peru, Vermont a \r\ntown that figures prominently in my husband&#8217;s family. According to \r\nLippincott, Peru, a post-village in Bennington County, Vermont, 30 miles\r\n S. of Rutland had a township population of 500.&#8221;<sup>5</sup> It&#8217;s not \r\nmuch bigger today. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Visit the Past</strong><br>Since it\r\n isn&#8217;t possible to sit in H.G.

Taylor", "country": "Massachusetts", "title": "County Resources in Massachusetts", "content": "<p>\"Few areas in this country or the British Isles equal the \r\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts for the quantity and quality of its \r\nhistorical records,\" stated Edward W. Hanson and Homer Vincent Ruther in\r\n their 1984 book, <em>Genealogical Research in New England</em>. What they\r\n said almost twenty years ago remains true today. In fact, the access to\r\n these records has only increased with time thanks to the Internet. \r\nRather than focus on specific town records that are useful only if you \r\nknow the name of the town, let's survey county level materials. \r\nResearchers in Massachusetts are fortunate in that there is an amazing \r\namount of genealogical and historical information available for the \r\nstate's counties. Listed below are five different avenues to explore to \r\ndiscover more about your family.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Know Your County<br></strong>As colonists began spreading out from the \r\noriginal settlements and acquiring new land it became necessary to \r\ndivide the state into counties. Even parts of New Hampshire were once \r\nunder the jurisdiction of Massachusetts from 1641/2 to 1679. In order to\r\n access county records, you first need to identify the correct one based\r\n on where your family lived and when. For instance, Suffolk County \r\noriginally included land now found in Norfolk and Worcester Counties. If\r\n your ancestor lived in Dedham after 1793 then they were in Norfolk \r\nCounty rather than Suffolk County. Thomas Galvin's <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pictonpress.com/store/show/1821\">Historical\r\n Data Relating to Counties, Cities and Towns in Massachusetts, 5th \r\nEdition</a></em>(NEHGS, 1997) helps sort out the details.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Date County Formed</strong><br>Barnstable 1685<br>Berkshire 1761<br>Bristol\r\n 1685<br>Dukes 1683<br>Essex 1643<br>Franklin 1811<br>Hampden 1812<br>Hampshire\r\n 1662<br>Middlesex 1643<br>Nantucket 1695<br>Norfolk 1793<br>Plymouth \r\n1685<br>Suffolk 1643<br>Worcester 1731</p>\r\n<p><strong>Land and Probate Records</strong> <br>In Massachusetts, these records \r\nare located on the county level rather than in town halls. In larger \r\ncounties this may be further broken down so that records are divided \r\nbetween two repositories. Consult Marcia Melnyk's <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://pictonpress.com/store/show/1856\">The \r\nGenealogist's Handbook for New England Research</a></em>(NEHGS, 2001) to\r\n find out where materials exist for the county you are interested in. </p>\r\n<p>The good news is that many land records are now online and available \r\nfor various fees.

Of course, researchers can also use original records by \r\nvisiting research facilities on the county level.</p>\r\n<p><strong>County Histories and Biographical Cyclopedias<br></strong>Did you know \r\nthat published histories exist for every county in Massachusetts? \r\nBesides being a wonderful resource for historical information, many \r\ncounty histories also feature genealogical data on prominent families. \r\nBiographical encyclopedias, also known as \"mug books\" due to the number \r\nof photographs of prominent citizens in them, became popular civic \r\nendeavors in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Individuals \r\ninvited to participate in these encyclopedias often wrote their own \r\nbiographies or genealogical statements. Be sure to verify all the \r\nmaterial mentioned in one of these publications in case your relative \r\nhadn't done their research. Consult P. William Filby's <em>A Bibliography\r\n of American County Histories</em> (1985) or John Haskell's comprehensive\r\n <em>Massachusetts: A Bibliography of Its History</em> (1976) for titles \r\nand locations.

There are articles on all \r\nsix New England states, including Edward W. Hanson and Homer Vincent \r\nRutherford&#8217;s &#8220;Genealogical Research in Massachusetts: A Survey and \r\nBibliographical Guide,&#8221; which was originally published in the <em>New England \r\nHistorical and Genealogical Register,</em> 135 (1981): 163&#8211;98. The authors treat \r\nvarious topics and provide detailed information about counties and towns. This \r\narticle also has a select bibliography of town histories and compiled \r\ngenealogies. If you do much New England research, this is worth owning. \r\nUnfortunately, it is currently out of print. \r\n</li>\r\n<li><em>Ancestry&#8217;s Red Book: American State, County, and Town Sources</em>, rev. \r\ned. (Salt Lake City: Ancestry, 1992). The Massachusetts chapter, by Alice \r\nEichholz, provides some historical background, then topic by topic gives detail \r\non various sources, including some bibliography and addresses of repositories. \r\nThere is also a handy list of counties, with information about their formation \r\nand the location of probate and deeds. A list of towns shows when they were \r\nformed, the parent town(s) and location of land records. Available through many \r\ncommercial genealogy sources, e.g., this site, as a book ($49.95) and on CD-ROM \r\nas Ancestry Reference Library, which includes several other books as well \r\n($69.95).

Melnyk (Boston: NEHGS, 1999). A new edition of this well-used resource! Each \r\nstate section begins with a map showing counties and towns and a list of towns \r\nwith some basic information on each. For Massachusetts it provides the date \r\nestablished, parent town, county, and a code that identifies where one can find \r\nthe vital records. Various sections give the nitty-gritty detail of where to \r\nfind records, vital, census, probate, land, cemetery, church, military, and \r\nimmigration and naturalization records. There is also information on libraries, \r\nincluding LDS Family History Centers, and societies. Finally there is a very \r\nvaluable but brief bibliography. This book is indispensable if you are working \r\non site in New England. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>William Francis Galvin [Secretary of the Commonwealth], <em>Historical Data \r\nRelating to Counties, Cities and Towns in Massachusetts</em> (Boston, NEHGS, \r\n1997). This is a new edition of the 1966 publication. Town by town, it gives \r\ncomplete detail on their formation and border changes. Part 3 of the earlier \r\nedition, &#8220;Extinct Places,&#8221; has been incorporated into the main text, and a new \r\nindex refers the reader to a new category under each town called \r\n&#8220;Section/Village Names.&#8221; There is statewide map at the beginning; small maps of \r\neach county are given at the end.

Published in many editions, this book has sections on each \r\nstate. After some basic information on a few topics, there is a list of \r\n&#8220;Genealogical Archives, Libraries, and Societies.&#8221; This is followed by \r\ninformation on census records and mortality schedules, a small bibliography and \r\nfinally county data, the date created, an abbreviated summary of records \r\navailable, the address and phone number of the courthouse and a list of towns \r\norganized before 1800.

Schweitzer, <em>Massachusetts Genealogical Research</em> (1990) \r\nprovides much of the same information in the sources cited above but in a rather \r\nawkward format. It has an opening chapter with background information, a long \r\nsecond chapter on types of records with all sorts of bibliographical \r\nsuggestions.

Unlike most other states, these records are kept in the \r\ntowns. There was no statewide registry until 1841. Even then, some towns were \r\nslow to submit copies. Boston did not comply with the new law until \r\n1848.<br><br>Perhaps because it was a deliberate legal act, marriages were the \r\nmost likely to be recorded. Births far outnumber deaths in the official civil \r\nrecords. But births were not necessarily recorded at the time or even in the \r\nsame town where they occurred. Sometimes one can tell by looking at the original \r\nrecords that a father probably visited the clerk and recounted the vital events \r\nfor his whole family at one time, often including his and his wife&#8217;s birth, \r\ntheir marriage date, and children born at a previous residence. If we are lucky, \r\nhe brought the family Bible along to assist his memory.<br><br>Where does one \r\nfind these records? What indexes exist? Which records are in print or manuscript \r\ncopy or on microform? Remember that the original records are always in the town \r\nor city clerk&#8217;s vault. Divorce records are kept in the probate courts and will \r\nnot be discussed here.<br><br>Think in terms of three periods of time: </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><ul>\r\n<li>1906 to the present \r\n</li>\r\n<li>1841 to 1905 \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Pre-1850</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><br><strong>1906 to the Present</strong><br><br>Almost all vital records are open to \r\nthe public. The only exceptions are out-of-wedlock and sometimes abnormal births \r\n(when there has been a physician&#8217;s report filed) and marriages. Corrected \r\nrecords filed later will be in a different place, and the original will not be \r\naccessible. If you know the town where the vital event occurred, you can go \r\nthere or write to the clerk for a copy. Call ahead for hours and fees if you \r\nneed a certificate. The clerk who answers may even look to see whether they have \r\nthe record you want. If you do not know the town, look in the state \r\nindexes.<br><br>Microfilm copies of the indexes to 1971 are at the State \r\nArchives and a few other places (see the list in the next section). The original \r\nindex volumes are at the State Registry of Vital Records and Statistics. This is \r\nnow at 150 Mt. Vernon Street, Dorchester, MA 02125-3105. Telephone: 617-740-2600 \r\n-- not far from the Massachusetts State Archives. Unless procedures change at \r\nthe new location, you can get a certified copy for $6, or go there and search \r\nfor $3 per hour on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from 9-12 and 2-4:30. \r\nThe indexes are in volumes for five-year periods. Be sure to check spellings \r\nimaginatively. Fill out a slip for each entry you want to examine, and hand \r\nthree at a time to the attendant when he calls for them, every fifteen minutes \r\nor so. He must check each birth or marriage entry to see whether it is all right \r\nfor you to look at it. Some are in books and some on microfilm. If you have \r\nlooked up the references ahead of time, and it is not crowded, you may be able \r\nto examine up to six records in half an hour.<br><br><strong>1841 to \r\n1905</strong><br><br>Every five years another five-year segment of the records is \r\ntransferred from the State Registry to the State Archives, and microfilm becomes \r\navailable for purchase from the Family History Library (FHL), but only by \r\ninstitutions and with written permission from the state. The next five years of \r\nrecords will probably be transferred sometime in 2001. Bills before the state \r\nlegislature, S345 in the Senate and H122 in the House, if passed, would provide \r\nfor the transfer of marriages and deaths through 31 December 1955 and births \r\nthrough 31 December 1915 to the State Archives.<br><br>Presently both indexes \r\nand records for 1841-1905 are available at the State Archives, across the \r\nparking lot from the JFK Library on Columbia Point.

The spelling \r\nof surnames is exactly as it appears in the record, so check all possible \r\nspellings.<br><br>The State Archives will search for and issue certificates for \r\n$3 for each event. If an approximate date is known, they will search \r\napproximately three index volumes, i.e., fifteen years. It is a good idea to \r\nnarrow down the time by using census or other records first. Surprisingly, only \r\nabout 40% of the approximately 150 requests per week that the archivists receive \r\ncan be found in the records. So give all relevant information, including date, \r\nplace, spouse, parents, and age -- whatever you already know. When there is a \r\ncommon name, if both the year and at least the general area are known there is a \r\nmuch greater chance of success.<br><br><strong>Pre-1850 Vital \r\nRecords</strong><br><br>There is no master statewide index to records before 1841. \r\nHowever, a large percentage of birth and marriage (not death) records are in the \r\nInternational Genealogical Index (IGI). Many have been submitted by members of \r\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but the Family History \r\nDepartment of the Church has also extracted records from most of the published \r\nbooks and from some original records. Thus the IGI serves to a large extent as \r\nan index. Nevertheless, it is well to bear in mind that member submissions have \r\nbeen taken from a myriad of sources, such as genealogies, town histories, and \r\nunpublished family compilations. The place given for the event may have been \r\ncarefully researched or may have been a guess, usually based on a known \r\nresidence.<br><br>Family Tree Maker&#8217;s <a href=\"http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/231facd.html\" target=\"_new\">Family \r\nArchives CD #231</a>, <em>Marriage Index: Massachusetts, 1633-1850</em>, contains \r\nmarriages from about 227 towns.

These volumes are in nearly \r\nevery public library in Massachusetts, and many other libraries have at least a \r\nselection of them. The compilers arranged the names in alphabetical order. While \r\nthis makes searching easier, the original order has been lost. Items from church \r\nand cemetery records and others, such as Bible records and newspaper notices, \r\nhave usually been included. If there was a town record of birth, a baptism was \r\nnot included unless it added information. The same would be true for other types \r\nof records as well.<br><br>Records of many towns have been published in \r\nindependent volumes or in the <em>Register</em> or the <em>Mayflower Descendant</em> \r\n(see the <em>New England Handbook, Redbook</em> or PERSI). Sometimes these too are \r\nalphabetical; other times they follow the original order and are then \r\nindexed.<br><br>There are many unpublished transcriptions of town vital records. \r\nSome are on FHL microfilm.

It&#8217;s easy to get carried away with excitement tracing a \r\nnotable ancestor, especially when you find materials that help tell the story of \r\nhis or her involvement in a key event in early American history.&#160; It&#8217;s a \r\nwonderful melding of history and genealogy.&#160; Here&#8217;s a method for staying on \r\ntrack and an overview of resources. </p>\r\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s Available in Print? </strong></p>\r\n<p>When researching topics I start with what&#8217;s in print because the resources \r\nare easy to locate and often lead to new discoveries. You&#8217;ll also save time. \r\nRather than hunting for documents and sifting through irrelevant ones, start \r\nwith the printed sources and consult footnotes to locate those pertinent to your \r\nancestor. </p>\r\n<p>After first checking the index to see if there are any specific references to \r\nyour ancestor, study the text to familiarize yourself with the background \r\nhistory. This will help you interpret what you do find. </p>\r\n<p>Your local public library should be able to obtain many of the titles listed \r\nbelow through interlibrary loan.

All these facts help you to understand them as people \r\nrather than just names and dates. You can start with general histories of \r\nMassachusetts to read about immigration patterns or work from specific details \r\nsuch as place names. In either case it&#8217;s a good idea to begin by searching card \r\ncatalogs, online bookstores, and websites for available resources. Then develop \r\na bibliography of printed materials that can help you fill in the blanks on your \r\nfamily tree. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>Here are some of my favorite printed local history sources to help you get \r\nstarted.&#160; Watch for additional material on these resources in future \r\ncolumns.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Gazetteers</strong></p>\r\n<p>You&#8217;ve just discovered from a document that your family once lived in an area \r\nyou never heard of.&#160; One of the best ways to find out more about that location \r\nis to consult a gazetteer. Contemporary gazetteers will tell you where a place \r\nis, but nineteenth century volumes let you peek into the past.&#160; These \r\ndictionaries of place names contain an amazing amount of useful data. Suppose \r\nyour ancestor lived in Farleyville, Massachusetts. Well, in the 1890 <em>A \r\nGazetteer of the State of Massachusetts</em> by Rev. Elias Nason and George J. \r\nVarney you&#8217;ll discover Farleyville is actually a village in the town of \r\n&#160;Wendell. By turning to the appropriate page you will locate a description of \r\nWendell that includes the number of inhabitants (509), its location, and a list \r\nof all the villages within the town. The fact that it is on the Fitchburg \r\nRailroad line tells you how people and goods were transported. Economic data, \r\nsuch as the types of industries active in the area, might enlighten you about \r\nwhat they did here, and you can use that information to <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/research/services/articles_help_wanted_researching.asp\">track down \r\nemployment records</a>. The notation that there were both Congregational and \r\nBaptist churches can lead you to church records.&#160; Gazetteers for Massachusetts \r\n&#160;are available at NEHGS and at other repositories, so start browsing online card \r\ncatalogs for available copies.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Travel Guides</strong></p>\r\n<p>The use of travel guides will allow you to build on what you&#8217;ve learned in \r\nyour study of gazetteers. In the nineteenth century, Moses King published a \r\nseries of guidebooks for major cities. His <em>King&#8217;s Hand-Book of Boston</em>, \r\nfirst printed in 1878, is like taking a walk in the past. Information about \r\nroadways, buildings, charitable organizations, clubs, churches, and schools is \r\ngiven, sometimes accompanied by an illustration. You can use the facts to make \r\nyour family story more interesting or to track down additional records for \r\nplaces no longer in existence. In the twentieth century, auto clubs printed \r\ndriving guides to non-metropolitan areas that included tourist information. \r\n<em>Massachusetts: A Guide to Its Places and People</em> (Houghton Mifflin, 1937), \r\ncompiled by the Federal Writers Project of Works Progress Administration, \r\nmentioned local history and presented a modified tour of towns.&#160; Before you know \r\nit you will want to use these guides to take a trip in time and add historical \r\ndetails to your genealogy. </p>\r\n<p><strong>County and Town Histories</strong></p>\r\n<p>In the nineteenth century, publishers printed local histories that included \r\nbiographies and even genealogies of families who contributed to the cost of \r\npublication. These &#8220;mug&#8221; books, so called because a picture of the subject often \r\naccompanied their biography, are fun to look at. The basic facts of local \r\nhistory appear but because of their narrow focus these county and town histories \r\noften include details broader histories leave out. The biographies are meant to \r\nflatter contributors so all details should be researched and verified.&#160; Not all \r\nearly families have bragging rights to having immigrated with John Winthrop.&#160; An \r\nearlier column, &#8220;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/research/services/articles_county_resources_mass.asp\">County Resources in \r\nMassachusetts</a>,&#8221; covered printed histories and where to find them. Consult P. \r\nWilliam Filby's <em>A Bibliography of American County Histories</em> (1985) or \r\nJohn Haskell's comprehensive <em>Massachusetts: A Bibliography of Its History</em> \r\n(1976) for titles and locations. The Committee for a New England Bibliography \r\nperiodically updates Haskell's work and you can search the latest volume (nine) \r\n<a href=\"http://nebib.uvm.edu/\" target=\"new\">online</a>. The NEHGS research and \r\ncirculating libraries also have a wonderful collection of these books. </p>\r\n<p>It is not enough to follow the written word about your ancestor&#8217;s town. Take \r\ntime to look at pictures and imagine what life was like. <a href=\"http://www.arcadiapublishing.com/\" target=\"new\">The Arcadia Publishing \r\nCompany</a> publishes illustrated town histories in their Images of America \r\nseries. Books exist for many Massachusetts towns. Arcadia is always looking for \r\nknowledgeable people to work with them to publish a local history. If there \r\nisn&#8217;t a volume on your town, propose the idea to them and make it happen. \r\nContact information is available on their website. You can purchase these books \r\nthrough online booksellers or borrow them from a library. </p>\r\n<p><strong>City Directories</strong></p>\r\n<p>City directories can help you create a year-by-year timeline for your \r\nancestors. The first city directory was printed in Boston in 1789, and other \r\nareas eventually followed suit. The NEHGS Research Library has a complete \r\ncollection of Boston directories on microfiche on the 4<sup>th</sup> floor. \r\nStandard listings include names, residence, occupation, and sometimes the place \r\nof employment.&#160; While these volumes are useful to track an ancestor&#8217;s movements \r\nduring their lifetime, the full research potential only becomes known if you \r\nlook in the front and back of the book. This is where you will find maps, street \r\nnames, business directories, advertisements, and lists of clubs, companies, and \r\nchurches. Discover the name of the minister at the church where your ancestor \r\nmarried or verify when a photographer was in business. There are so many ways to \r\nuse a city directory that this topic requires a column all of its own.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newspapers</strong></p>\r\n<p>Many researchers use newspapers to search for birth, marriage, and death \r\nnotices without scanning the news for important events. Reading newspapers can \r\nuncover your great grandfather&#8217;s reasons for moving to a particular area.&#160; His \r\nmigration might have been triggered by a land company&#8217;s notice placed in the \r\npaper or the opening of a new factory. If you truly want to get a sense of what \r\nyour ancestor&#8217;s lives were like then take some time to read the news. The Boston \r\nPublic Library has a large collection of newspapers published in Massachusetts. \r\nOne of the first things that new immigrant groups did when they settled in a \r\nparticular area was print a newspaper. A list of ethnic papers appears on <a href=\"http://www.bostonfamilyhistory.net/\" target=\"new\">http://www.bostonfamilyhistory.net/</a>, and a search of the <a href=\"http://www.bpl.org/\" target=\"new\">Boston Public Library catalog</a> will \r\nresult in many of these newspapers as well. </p>\r\n<p>Background research can help you find solutions to brick walls and let you \r\ndiscover the &#8220;real&#8221; person behind the name and date on your pedigree chart. \r\nConsult \"<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/research/services/articles_overlooked_repositories_mass.asp\">Often-Overlooked \r\nRepositories in Massachusetts</a>\" to expand your search for printed material \r\nbeyond Boston. Public libraries and local historical societies are also good \r\nhunting places for new material, printed or otherwise. Two helpful guides are \r\nElizabeth Petty Bentley&#8217;s <em>Genealogist&#8217;s Address Book</em> (GPC, 1998) and \r\nMarcia Melnyk&#8217;s <em><a href=\"http://pictonpress.com/store/show/1856\" target=\"_blank\">Genealogist&#8217;s Handbook for New England Research, Fourth \r\nEdition</a></em> (NEHGS, reprint 2001).

If you've never tried walking in your\r\n ancestor's footsteps then you are missing a unique experience. Take an \r\nhistorical map of your town that shows landmarks and buildings and walk \r\nany street that appears on the map. You won't believe how it has \r\nchanged. You will notice differences in names, structures, and even \r\nbuilding usage. It's a great activity for kids too. Using a map of the \r\nneighborhood of their school or the street they live on, ask the \r\nchildren to identify what has changed. This is a fun activity that also \r\nlets them appreciate history. However, you won't be able to take that \r\nwalk unless you have an historical Massachusetts town map or a \r\nreproduction of one. Now that the 1870 Beers County Atlas CD Collection \r\nof Massachusetts is available from Piper Publishing, studying the past \r\nhas never been easier. </p>\r\n<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p>Piper Publishing, located in Easton, Connecticut, works \r\ncollaboratively with libraries to reproduce &#8220;significant popular \r\nhistorical academic collections in print and electronic formats.&#8221; A \r\ncomplete list of their offerings appears on their website <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.piperpublishing.com/\">http://www.piperpublishing.com/</a>.\r\n </p>\r\n<p>As every genealogist knows, maps are very valuable research tools. \r\nHaving a collection of Massachusetts atlases on a series of CDs opens up\r\n new avenues of sleuthing to family historians because of the amount of \r\ninformation contained on each map. The Beers family produced many \r\nwell-known nineteenth-century maps with detailed data, but it is \r\ndifficult to find a complete atlas. Many of them are in poor condition \r\nor have been disbound for framing and sale. By collaborating with the \r\nConnecticut Valley Historical Museum, the Jones Library Special \r\nCollections Library in Amherst, the Massachusetts State Library Rare \r\nCollections, and the Monson Free Library, Piper Publishing was able to \r\nmake this new set available to researchers.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>There are CDs for Berkshire, Bristol, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, \r\nHampshire, Middlesex, and Worcester counties. Each one contains a \r\nfacsimile of the original maps published by the Beers family, which \r\nmeans they feature business directories, statistics, a table of \r\ndistances, and engravings of significant buildings. The front matter of \r\neach volume presents an overview of the history of the county and each \r\nlocality that appears in the atlas.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Beers atlases offer a fascinating glimpse into the past. Unlike many \r\nearlier maps, the Beers set includes the names and location of \r\ngeographic features such as ponds and hills, schools, churches, mills, \r\nbusinesses, railroad lines, and the surname and at least first initial \r\nof property or house owners for all but the most densely populated areas\r\n of cities and towns. Finding the name of an ancestor on a map helps \r\nfamily historians discover exactly where ancestors lived, so that they \r\nmay learn more about the area and perhaps even visit the site. </p>\r\n<p>These maps also include cemeteries, which may help you find that \r\nhistoric graveyard that you cannot locate on a contemporary map. The \r\ncemetery could now be overgrown and forgotten, but its location might be\r\n clearly marked in this resource. Unfortunately for genealogists, there \r\nis no surname index to assist in locating directory listings and land \r\nowners, so you need to know exactly which map to consult. </p>\r\n<p>System requirements are a computer with at least Windows 95/98, and \r\n64 MB of RAM. There is no installation required. If you want to print \r\nout any of the maps you will need Adobe Acrobat, which can be downloaded\r\n for free at <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.adobe.com/\">http://www.adobe.com/</a>.\r\n Just click on the print command and an entire page of the atlas will be\r\n printed on a sheet of 8.5 x 11 paper. Printing the close-up details is a\r\n little more complicated, but a separate card enclosed with the CD leads\r\n users through the steps. For good quality prints, photo paper is \r\nrecommended. Copies suitable for framing are available from the \r\npublisher. </p>\r\n<p>Aside from the multi-step process required to print out magnified or \r\nzoomed-in views, the CD is otherwise easy to use. Since there is no \r\nsoftware to download, you can begin using it immediately. An \r\nintroduction places the maps in historical context and a publisher&#8217;s \r\nnote provides background on the collaboration that made this possible.&#160; \r\nEach map appears quite small and unreadable until you utilize the zoom \r\nfeature, which is activated by clicking the + button. </p>\r\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example of one of the towns in Franklin County &#8212; \r\nHeath. A short paragraph outlines some basic historical facts, such as \r\nwho founded the town and when it was established. The population \r\nstatistics may be of particular interest to genealogists &#8212;in Heath there\r\n were 1,200 inhabitants in 1832 but only 613 in 1870, due to emigration.\r\n On page nine of the atlas on the CD it is possible to see a full view \r\nof the town or an inset of Heath Centre. This inset is one of the \r\nspecial features of the nineteenth-century atlases and oversized maps \r\nthat Beers and other companies produced. The full town page is too large\r\n to include the information present in the small town center. Several \r\nclicks on the zoom button allow you to view the inset and see that a \r\nMrs. H. White lived in the center of town, which is also where S.W. \r\nBarber&#8217;s Boot, Shoe and Grocery Store conducted business. While property\r\n boundaries are not visible in a whole town, they are outlined in the \r\ndetailed inset maps. </p>\r\n<p>In addition to your stroll through the past, there are several ways \r\nto use these maps. Here are a few other suggestions.</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Study the map to understand the local history of an area and \r\nincorporate what you&#8217;ve learned into your family history. Find your \r\nancestor&#8217;s hometown from other documents such as census and city \r\ndirectories and then try to find exactly where they lived by consulting a\r\n map.<br><br></li>\r\n<li>Visit the site and take pictures to use in your family history. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Track your family history using maps of the area much like you would\r\n with city directories. Try to find relations on any printed maps \r\navailable of the area in which they resided. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Use the maps to lead you to a new family story. For instance, if you\r\n have several ancestral families living in one town you might discover \r\nyour great grandfather married the girl next door. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In general, maps are a lot of fun beyond the genealogical material \r\nthey contain. They are beautiful glimpses into a world that no longer \r\nexists. Even without a surname index, these CDs are an exciting new tool\r\n for genealogists. Each county CD is reasonably priced in the $35 to $45\r\n range.</p>\r\n</div></div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/nineteenth-century-beers-atlases-and-local-maps-on-CD-ROM/", "published": "", "id": 244}, {"author": "Maureen A.

Perhaps the most important \r\nthing a new researcher should know is that the 1850 census is the first one in \r\nwhich the name of each individual (at least each white individual) in the \r\nhousehold was listed. Before that, from 1790 to 1840, the census taker recorded \r\nonly the name of the head of household and followed it with a series of marks in \r\nvarious age categories and usually a few categories describing race or \r\noccupation, e.g. agriculture or manufacturing. </p>\r\n<p>Census records are available on microfilm in many places: </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>The National Archives, their regional branches, and the Family History \r\nLibrary in Salt Lake City </li>\r\n<li>Many local libraries have at least some films for the local area.

But \r\nbefore using the census, one usually wants to use an index. For the features of \r\nall the various indexes, see these reference works. These indexes may be found \r\nin various places. </li>\r\n<li>On the Internet one can look at <a href=\"http://www.ancestry.com/\" target=\"_new\">Ancestry.com</a>and <a href=\"http://www.familytreemaker.com/\" target=\"_new\">FamilyTreeMaker.com</a>or <a href=\"http://www.genealogylibrary.com/\" target=\"_new\">GenealogyLibrary.com</a> </li>\r\n<li>LDS Family History Centers have an earlier edition of the Accelerated \r\nIndexing Systems (AIS) 1790 to 1850 indexes on microfiche. Here all the indexes \r\nfor the various states for a given year are compiled into one nation-wide list \r\n</li>\r\n<li>The National Archives and its various branches and the Family History \r\nLibrary in Salt Lake City have many of the indexes available as books and/or CDs \r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When searching, remember that indexes from 1790-1870 must be searched for \r\neach possible different spelling. From 1880 we have Soundex indexes. Also \r\nremember that the index includes only the head of household and, beginning in \r\n1850, others in the household with different surnames. Thus if you are looking \r\nfor a wife or child, you will need to know the name of the family head. The \r\nexception for Massachusetts is the new index to the 1870 census, which seems to \r\ninclude every individual. However, the indexers evidently took some shortcuts. I \r\nfound, for example, that \"Jos. Page\" in the index turned out to be \"Joseph Page\" \r\nin the census itself. A new index to the 1880 census should be available at \r\nFamilySearch.org sometime in 2001. </p>\r\n<p>The 1910 census for Massachusetts presents a special challenge, as there is \r\nno index. Some volunteers started out to do it, but the project was too large \r\nand soon stopped. For a place of any considerable size, it would be helpful to \r\nsit down with city directories from, say, 1908 to 1912, locate the family's \r\naddress and ward and then use a detailed town map of surrounding streets while \r\nrolling through the film. See the bibliography below for three helpful \r\nresources. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Mortality Schedules</strong><br>The 1850 to 1880 mortality schedules, taken \r\nalong with the federal censuses for those years, should perhaps have been \r\nincluded in the previous column on vital records. This record of deaths, which \r\nincludes ages and cause of death, for the year previous to each census, that is, \r\nfor example, from 1 June 1849 to 1 June 1850, is found on National Archives \r\nmicrofilm T1204, cataloged at the Family History Library as 1421015-023. </p>\r\n<p>An index, which appears on both microfiche at many Family History Centers and \r\non Family Archives CD #164, does not include Massachusetts (and is incomplete \r\nfor the states it does cover). </p>\r\n<p><strong>The 1890 Veterans' Census</strong><br>Massachusetts is among the states for \r\nwhich the special veterans' census of 1890 survived, National Archives number \r\nM123. Massachusetts is on FHL films #338170-175. However, Worcester Co. is \r\nmissing. Not only is this census on microfilm, it has been indexed. See Bryan \r\nLee Dilts, <em>1890 Massachusetts Census Index of Civil War Veterans or their \r\nWidows</em> (Salt Lake City: Index Pub., 1985). It is important to look at the \r\nactual census film, because the entry will give a great deal of information \r\nwhich can lead you to various war records, particularly of the Civil War, but \r\nalso occasionally of the War of 1812 or the Mexican War. </p>\r\n<p><strong>The State Censuses of 1855 and 1865</strong><br>The original schedules of these \r\ncensuses are at the Massachusetts State Archives. However, even there one must \r\nuse the microfilm. NEHGS has copies of the 68 films, which are also available at \r\nany LDS Family History Center. </p>\r\n<p>Most towns are unindexed, but Ann S. Lainhart has transcribed, indexed, and \r\npublished some 73 towns. Copies are at many libraries. Search the NEHGS library \r\ncatalog by author's name and town <a href=\"http://library.nehgs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>&#160;or the <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\" target=\"_new\">Family History Library Catalog </a>by author's name for a list. </p>\r\n<p><strong>The 1771 Tax</strong><br>Original schedules for about half of the towns in the \r\nstate survive and are in the State Archives, but Betty Pruitt has published a \r\nmassive computerized index volume available in many libraries. Not only does \r\nthis give the name of the landowner, it also lists buildings, livestock, and \r\nproduce. See Betty Hobbs Pruitt, <em>The Massachusetts Tax Valuation List of \r\n1771</em> (Boston: G. K. Hall, 1978). </p>\r\n<p><strong>The 1798 Direct Tax</strong><br>This federal tax identifies both owner and \r\ntenant of each individual property, plus some additional descriptive \r\ninformation. Only parts of Norfolk and Suffolk Counties are missing. The \r\noriginal schedules for this federal tax are owned by NEHGS and were filmed by \r\nthem in 1978, along with an index and guide. They are available on microfilm at \r\nthe Family History Library but are not available for circulation to Family \r\nHistory Centers. However, the film may have been purchased from NEHGS by other \r\nlibraries. See also Michael H. Gorn, ed., <em>An Index and Guide to the Microfilm \r\nEdition of the Massachusetts and Maine Direct Tax Census of 1798</em> (Boston: \r\nNEHGS, 1979). The Boston list was published in volume 22 of the Boston Record \r\nCommissioners series of city records. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Other Tax Records</strong><br>Every town compiled tax lists every year. There \r\nwere town, church, school and county taxes as well as colony or state taxes. \r\nThese may sometimes be found among the town records, often on microfilm. Not \r\nonly do these lists give some idea of the individual's real estate and wealth \r\nrelative to other townsmen, they may indicate how many males over 21 were in the \r\nhousehold. In fact, many individuals were only taxed on their polls, so they \r\nprovide a good check on the birth year when a young man appears for the first \r\ntime. </p>\r\n<p>Many lists other than those for 1771 are at the State Archives. Look also \r\nunder the category \"taxation\" in the Family History Library Catalog (FHLC) as \r\nwell as under \"town records\" for the town being searched. Copies of most, if not \r\nall, of the microfilms of Massachusetts town records in the FHLC are at the \r\nState Archives on Columbia Point. </p>\r\n<p>Other lists appear in various places. The Massachusetts State Library has \r\nsome lists from 1780 to 1811 in their Special Collections in Room 55 in the \r\nbasement of the west wing of the State House. See the bibliography below for \r\nsome specific published records. </p>\r\n<p>Br&#248;derbund's Family Archive CD #136, the old GRS version, has records, \r\nprobably mostly tax lists, for many Massachusetts towns. Unfortunately it does \r\nnot identify the list itself beyond giving the year and the place. On the other \r\nhand, these old GRS CDs can be searched by given name and played with in ways \r\nthe newer search engine does not permit. The new version is CD #310, ambiguously \r\nlabeled <em>Census Index: Colonial America, 1607-1789</em>. At <a href=\"http://www.genealogy.com/\" target=\"_new\">Genealogy.com</a>one can see a \r\ndescription of it and see how many entries it contains from each of twelve \r\nMassachusetts counties. One still does not know exactly what records it was \r\ncompiled from, but it is nevertheless useful. Ronald Vern Jackson, <em>Records \r\nIndexed by AIS</em> ([Salt Lake City]: Corporation of the President of the Church \r\nof Jesus Christ of L.D.S., c1984, c1983), FHL microfiche 6067399, may contain \r\nthe answer needed. </p>\r\n<p><strong>City Directories</strong><br>As noted above, city directories can be a great \r\nhelp in locating individuals, particularly in the 1880 and 1910 censuses, but, \r\nsince indexes are not perfect, they may also prove useful when someone cannot be \r\nfound in 1900 or 1920. NEHGS has a large collection of Massachusetts city and \r\ntown directories on microfiche. A joint project with Ancestry.com will put these \r\non-line over the next few years. </p>\r\n<p>Of course, one must have an inkling of what town to look in, but once one \r\ndoes, an individual can be followed from year to year (sometimes at two-year \r\nintervals). Not only does this provide a name and address, it often gives the \r\noccupation, the place of business as well as the home, the deceased husband of a \r\nwidow and sometimes even information about death or removal to another town! \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Don't overlook other features of these directories. Use the street directory \r\nto pinpoint between which cross streets a house number falls and the description \r\nof wards to identify which census microfilm to consult. Look at the business \r\ndirectories, advertisements and other supplementary pages, which may differ from \r\nyear to year and publisher to publisher. </p>\r\n<p>City directories are available in many places: NEHGS to begin with, also the \r\nBoston Public Library, the Massachusetts State Library, local libraries and the \r\nFamily History Library, The American Antiquarian Society in Worcester and the \r\nLibrary of Congress. </p>\r\n<p><strong>A Bibliography</strong> </p>\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>Arends, Marthe. <em>Genealogy on CD-ROM</em>.

Kilburn", "country": "Massachusetts", "title": "Peter Bulkeley: Deacon and Co-Founder of Concord, Massachusetts", "content": "<p>One of the more important deacons to migrate to New England during the Great \r\nMigration of 1629&#8211;1640 was Peter Bulkeley.&#160; Peter (b. 1583) graduated from \r\nCambridge University in 1608 with an MA from St. John&#8217;s College. Peter&#8217;s line \r\ncan be traced back to Saher de Quincy, one of the barons who signed the Magna \r\nCharta in 1215, and also King Henry II. [i]&#160;&#160; He succeeded his father as deacon \r\nat the Odell Church in Cheshire (Bedfordshire), England, where he served until \r\nbeing forced out in 1634 during the purge of many of the &#8220;tainted&#8217;&#8221; Puritan \r\ndeacons at that time of religious upheaval.&#160; Peter and his family somehow \r\nmanaged to slip out of England, and, with the exception of eldest son Edward, \r\nwho made the journey the year before, they sailed to America on the ship Susan \r\n&amp; Ellen, arriving in Boston during the summer of 1635.&#160; Peter was one of the \r\nfounders of Concord, Massachusetts, and he would become one of the major \r\nministers in New England.&#160; Part of his fame rests on the fact that many of his \r\nsermons and writings have been published.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Bulkeley Genealogy in England</strong> <br>The Bulkeley surname can \r\nbe traced to the town of Bulkeley, Cheshire, some twelve miles southeast of \r\nChester and immediately south of the Bickerton Hills.&#160; Approximately five miles \r\nnorth in the Bickerton Hills is Beeston Castle, which affords a magnificent view \r\nof Bulkeley country in all four directions.&#160; Southwest of the town of Bulkeley \r\non Bulkeley Hall Lane is a large manor house called Bulkeley Hall. Robert de \r\nBulkileh was lord of this manor in 1200.&#160; His son William received a quitclaim \r\nfrom his two sisters in 1233 that provides solid evidence of their ownership of \r\nthe property at that time. [ii]&#160;&#160; The family retained ownership of the manor for \r\nseveral generations (and through several surname variations) until Peter de \r\nBulkylegh (b abt 1325), who held Haughton, Cheshire, in right of his wife, \r\nNichola le Brid, moved there with his family. It was Peter&#8217;s son who left \r\nCheshire for Woore, Shropshire, and this is where grandson Hugh was born (abt \r\n1405). For several generations the family remained in Woore, and it was here \r\nthat Peter&#8217;s grandfather, Thomas, was born about 1515. He later married \r\nElizabeth Grosvenor (abt 1539) in Bellaport, and they had five children. \r\nElizabeth&#8217;s mother was Ann Charlton, who was born about 1480 at Apley Castle, \r\nShropshire, and it is her ancestry that leads back to royalty.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Edward Bulkeley (b abt 1540) was the second child of Thomas and Elizabeth.&#160; \r\nEdward married Olive Irby (b abt 1547) about 1566 at Goldington, Bedfordshire. \r\nThey had eleven children, the youngest of which was Peter, our emigrant \r\nancestor. </p>\r\n<p>The Reverend Edward Bulkeley had a distinguished academic record.&#160; He \r\nmatriculated at St. John&#8217;s College in Cambridge, in 1555, when he was fifteen. \r\nHe was a scholar by 1555 and proceeded to earn four degrees over the course of \r\neighteen years, concluding his efforts with a DD in 1578. He became rector at \r\nOdell, probably in 1571, and remained in that post until 1609 when he resigned \r\nat the age of sixty-nine.&#160; He died at Odell early in January 1621.&#160; Dr. Bulkeley \r\nwas a moderate Puritan and passed his love of academics and books, as well as \r\nhis Puritan leanings, to his son Peter. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Peter Bulkeley in Odell</strong></p>\r\n<p>Peter was the most famous rector of the Church of All Saints in Odell, \r\nbecause of both his religious writings and his immigration to America. [iii]&#160;&#160; \r\nThe youngest child of Thomas and Olive, Peter was born in Odell on January 31, \r\n1583, and died in Concord, Massachusetts, March 9, 1659. [iv]&#160;&#160; Peter was \r\nadmitted to St. John&#8217;s College, Cambridge, when he was about sixteen.&#160; Cotton \r\nMather, in his Magnalia Christi Americana, wrote of Peter&#8217;s education as &#8220;... \r\nlearned, it was genteel, and, which was top of all, it was very pious.&#8221;&#160; He \r\nbecame a Fellow of St. John&#8217;s in 1605.&#160; He was also a university preacher and \r\ncanon of Lichfield in 1609, but returned to Odell in 1610 to assist his father.&#160; \r\nHis father resigned the same year and Peter became rector, a position he \r\nretained until &#8220;suspended&#8221; by church authorities in 1634.</p>\r\n<p>Peter married Jane Allen at Goldington, Bedfordshire, on April 12, 1613.&#160; She \r\nwas baptized at Goldington on January 13, 1588, and died at Odell about December \r\n8, 1626.&#160; They had nine [v] children but only six survived childhood. They \r\nundoubtedly moved into the rector&#8217;s house where his father and mother lived.&#160; \r\nHis mother died two years after the marriage, on March 10, 1615.&#160; His father \r\nprobably lived with the son and his growing family in the large house until he \r\ndied on January 5, 1621.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Five of Peter&#8217;s sons lived to sail to America. Their first son, Edward (bap \r\nAugust 5, 1614), was born the year after Peter and Jane were married.&#160; He \r\npreceded the family to Boston in 1634 and arranged for them to move directly \r\ninto a house in Cambridge after they arrived.&#160; He succeeded Peter as minister at \r\nConcord when his father died.&#160; The second son, Thomas (bap April 13, 1617), my \r\nancestor, married Sarah Jones, daughter of Reverend John Jones, and moved from \r\nConcord with the Reverend in 1644 to Fairfield, Connecticut, where he became a \r\nlandowner.&#160; The third son, John (bap February 6, 1620), was a member of \r\nHarvard&#8217;s first graduating class in 1642.&#160; He stayed at Harvard and taught, but \r\neventually returned to England where he became rector of Fordham, Essex.&#160; The \r\nfourth son, Joseph (bap May 4, 1623), and the fifth son, Daniel (bap August 28, \r\n1625), also came to America with the family.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Jane died on December 8, 1626, and was buried at Odell.&#160; She died during or \r\nshortly after childbirth, as the ninth child, Jabez, was baptized on December \r\n24, 1626 (he died in 1629).&#160; </p>\r\n<p>In addition to his personal tragedies in the 1620s, Peter was struggling with \r\nhis faith.&#160; Puritanism was a growing religious force and no preacher in the land \r\nwas unaffected by this new religion.&#160; Its appeal of simplicity, earnestness, and \r\ndefinite ideas about reform appealed to many devout and sincere clergymen.&#160; Many \r\nfelt that the English church of the day was too much concerned with ritual and \r\nceremonials.&#160; Jacobus states it thus: [vi] </p>\r\n<p>&#8220;In brief, the ideal of the Puritans was to get away from formalism, to \r\neliminate the trimmings and trappings, to appeal to the conscience of the \r\nindividual, and to make the Bible (rather than church doctrine) the basic guide \r\nand authority for the religious life.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>The crisis for Peter came in 1634 when he was suspended for not attending the \r\nvisitation of Sir Nathaniel Brent, Vicar-General.&#160; Peter himself later admitted \r\nthat he did not wear a surplice, nor make the sign of the cross in baptism, \r\nregarding them as superstitious ceremonies.&#160; The Bishop of Lincoln did not seem \r\nto object to what he considered token nonconformity, but Archbishop Laud would \r\nnot tolerate any deviation from church doctrine, hence the suspension.&#160; Peter \r\nknew that if he did not apologize and reform he would lose his rectorship.&#160; \r\nPeter chose not to yield but to continue his Puritan approach. He laid plans to \r\nmigrate to New England, where, despite being over fifty years old, he could \r\npreach completely from the heart and not be subject to constant eavesdropping \r\nand concern about deviation from church doctrine.&#160; It must have been a momentous \r\ndecision, for he was wealthy and lived nearly all his adult life in a large and \r\ncomfortable house in the village where he had grown up.&#160; He would be giving up \r\nphysical comfort for religious freedom.</p>\r\n<p>Today Odell&#8217;s population is less than two hundred. When my wife and I visited \r\nthe village in 1997, the Church of All Saints was definitely the prominent \r\nfeature.&#160; Immediately to the east of the church was the modified rector&#8217;s house \r\nwhere Peter was probably born and raised.&#160; A small village green and a \r\nthatched-roof public house with a sign reading &#8220;since 1716&#8221; are located a block \r\nfrom the church. A small stream runs through the village, with a side channel \r\nthrough the inoperative mill in the old mill house.&#160; The gears and wheel still \r\nremain.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>We visited the church on Sunday and the churchgoers welcomed us, as a \r\nBulkeley descendant was not a frequent occurrence.&#160; They showed us around the \r\nchurch, explained the stained glass windows, and showed us the font where Peter \r\nand his children were baptized.&#160; Peter was their most famous reverend and an \r\narea in the rear of the church had a table displaying books, scrapbooks, maps, \r\nand copies of various documents (including Archbishop Laud&#8217;s 1634 report on \r\nPeter&#8217;s &#8220;subversive&#8221; activities).&#160; Many Americans have visited the church in the \r\npast, and their interest is primarily responsible for assembling this \r\ncollection.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Peter remained an unmarried widower for eight years before marrying Grace \r\nChetwood in April 1635. [vii]&#160;&#160; That same year he liquidated his holdings and \r\nassembled &#163;6000 for the voyage to America. The trip took careful preparation.&#160; \r\nAnyone leaving the country had to obtain certificates from the justice of the \r\npeace and the church, and being a non-conformist minister he would not have been \r\nallowed to leave. Fortunately, some members of the clergy were sympathetic to \r\nnon-conformists and were willing to provide them with the required papers. \r\nFurthermore, most ship captains were interested in passage money, not religious \r\nmatters. </p>\r\n<p>The main challenge for Peter and his family was to avoid government spies, \r\nand to this end Peter took special precautions. On April 13, 1635,&#160; &#8220;Jo:Backley&#8221; \r\n[John Bulkeley] was placed on the ship&#8217;s approved passenger list.&#160; Five days \r\nlater &#8220;Ben Buckley&#8221; (11) and &#8220;Daniell Buckley&#8221; (9) were accepted [undoubtedly \r\nJoseph and Daniel].&#160; It is presumed that friends, perhaps those sailing with \r\nPeter, took these boys separately to the shipping office to give the impression \r\nthey were part of their families.&#160; Almost a month later, on May 8, his new wife, \r\nGrace, age 33, was put on the passenger list of the Elizabeth &amp; Ann, while \r\non the following day Peter, age 50, put his own name on the Susan &amp; Ellen \r\nlist.&#160; Both ships were to sail at about the same time, and in this way the \r\nfamily could exit England with less chance of discovery.&#160; However, Grace, who \r\nwas pregnant at the time, definitely sailed with her husband on the long voyage \r\nof the Susan &amp; Ellen, as written stories of her illness on the ship reveal.&#160; \r\nIt is likely that Grace simply changed places with another woman, who took her \r\nplace on the Elizabeth &amp; Ann.</p>\r\n<p>Edward, the eldest son, had sailed the year before and was making \r\npreparations for the arrival of Peter and his family. The second son, Thomas, \r\ndoes not appear on any passenger lists found to date, though he probably sailed \r\nwith his father under another name.&#160; Another theory is that the \r\nseventeen-year-old sailed with his older brother in 1634.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The trip was not without trauma.&#160; As previously noted, the pregnant Grace was \r\nvery ill for most of the trip and, according to one account, had died, but was \r\nresuscitated just before landing in Boston.&#160; She was carried from the ship as an \r\ninvalid, but fully recovered and bore four children: Gershom, born in Concord \r\nthe next January, Eleazer (b 1638), Dorothy (b August 2, 1640), and Peter (b \r\nAugust 12, 1643). Grace died in 1669 the age of sixty-seven.</p>\r\n<p>The ship arrived in midsummer and the family repaired to Cambridge where \r\nThomas had obtained accommodations for the family.&#160; The leadership in Boston, \r\nincluding Governor John Winthrop and Reverend Cotton Mather, agreed that \r\nBulkeley and Simon Willard should lead an expedition of about one hundred \r\nfamilies some fifteen miles west through the wilderness and establish a new \r\nchurch and settlement in the Musketaquid area, later to become Concord, \r\nMassachusetts. Although only twelve families actually made the trek, they \r\naccomplished what they had set out to do.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Settlement in Concord</strong></p>\r\n<p>Musketaquid was at the confluence of two rivers and was, in many respects, \r\nlike Odell, where Peter Bulkeley came from. [viii]&#160; Reynolds wrote of the \r\nsimilarity, \"The same green meadows, the same upland plains, the same tranquil \r\nstream, meet the gaze in the one case as in the other.\" Scudder describes the \r\nsite as having</p>\r\n<p>\"...seven natural ponds; more than nine miles of beaver-haunted \r\nfish-abounding river, bordered by meadows of lush grass . . . excellent for \r\ncattle; any number of lesser streams on which to build mills; several small \r\ncornfields already under Indian cultivation, and plenty of rich bottom land for \r\nclearing . . .\"</p>\r\n<p>Peter may have heard of Musketaquid in England, for his son Edward may have \r\npresented this idea to the Great and General Court, the governing body of the \r\ncolony of Massachusetts.&#160; On September 2, 1635, the town of Concord was \r\nincorporated by this court, not long after Peter&#8217;s arrival.</p>\r\n<p>Peter became acquainted with many of the colony&#8217;s settlers and several \r\nministers in the Boston area.&#160; He and the well-known minister John Cotton, of \r\nBoston&#8217;s First Church, were both Cambridge graduates and residents of the same \r\ndiocese in England.&#160; Peter was known as a courageous, well-educated leader who \r\npossessed a strong faith. His leadership was unquestioned, particularly in \r\nreligious matters, and he worked closely with Reverend Jones, who held the title \r\nof Minister, in establishing the first church.&#160; Peter was initially appointed \r\nTeacher by the Boston authorities and did not become Minister until Jones left \r\nin 1644.&#160; Jones was another disposed deacon from England who arrived in Boston a \r\nfew weeks after Peter and his family.</p>\r\n<p>While Peter became the key religious leader, the secular leader and \r\nco-founder of Concord was Simon Willard, a &#8220;thirty-year-old Kentish soldier, \r\nshrewd trader, expert surveyor.&#8221;&#160; As a leading citizen of the town, he was \r\nappointed to several prestigious posts, including captain of the militia \r\ncompany, the town&#8217;s first assistant to the governor, and its first magistrate.&#160; \r\nWillard later led the colony&#8217;s forces against the Indians and was made \r\ncommissioner of the colony&#8217;s fur trade.</p>\r\n<p>Led by Bulkeley and Willard, twelve families made the original trip to \r\nMusketaquid, which consisted of thirty-six square miles, six miles on each side. \r\nThe route they traversed, later called the Great or Bay Road, was rough, swampy \r\nin places, rocky in others, yet they forced their oxen with supplies and \r\nbelongings and finally arrived at the former Musketaquid and the new Concord.&#160; \r\nScudder describes the scene and the first years thusly:</p>\r\n<p>\"In front lay the little river.&#160; To the right, cutting off winds from the \r\nnorth, stretched a long, uneven, sandy ridge with a crook in its elbow, the \r\nforearm bent northward. In this ridge, the . . . dozen families scooped crude \r\ndugouts, where they lived through that first hard winter.&#160; Simon Willard knew \r\nall about wigwam dugouts, copied from Indian storage pits by ingenious white \r\nmen.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>\"Probably the first real house built was the minister&#8217;s, or the trader&#8217;s.&#160; \r\nRight afterwards would follow the meetinghouse for congregational worship.&#160; \r\nAfter the minister&#8217;s house came other permanent dwellings along the sunny side \r\nof the Bay Road beneath the ridge where the dugouts were caving in.&#160; Small \r\nhouses, smaller than most yeomen&#8217;s cottages in Kent and Suffolk and other \r\nBritish shires, from which their lines were copied, built of boards instead of \r\nEnglish brick or stone, the wood soon seasoning to a wasp-nest gray.&#160; Sedge from \r\nthe river meadows, in place of English thatch, for roofs &#8230; [ix] \"</p>\r\n<p>Each household was granted a land allotment of six acres. The portions of the \r\ngrant most suitable for plowing and planting were divided into planting fields \r\nand within them strips were divided equally among the settlers.&#160; Soon the common \r\nfields were exchanged and traded so that each person had his own block of land, \r\na much more economical way of managing the agricultural land.</p>\r\n<p>The first order of business, however, was the treaty with the Indians, which \r\ntook place at Jethro&#8217;s Oak, which today is marked with a sign.&#160; Simon Willard \r\nled the negotiations.&#160; They eventually purchased &#8220;6 myles of land square&#8221; from \r\nthe squaw sachem with the following:</p>\r\n<p>&#8230;for one parcel of wampum, several knives and hatchets, some hoes to replace \r\ntheir cultivating sticks and clamshells, some cotton clothes and shirts . . . \r\n.To the medicine man&#8212;the squaw sachem&#8217;s husband&#8212;a suit of cotton cloth, a \r\nhigh-crowned hat of heavy English felt, shoes, stockings, and a greatcoat. [x] \r\n</p>\r\n<p>With these negotiations and token payment the new settlers gained title to a \r\nlarge area.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Peter Bulkeley, the wealthiest of the group, reserved gristmill rights and \r\nlocated his millhouse at the &#8220;milldam,&#8221; now in the center of town where part of \r\nthe brickwork for the old millhouse is still present.&#160; This had been the site of \r\nan Indian fishing weir.</p>\r\n<p>On July 5, 1636, the Concord Church was officially organized in Cambridge \r\n(itself only six months old).&#160; The new church was the fifteenth established in \r\nMassachusetts. At the organizational meeting Peter Bulkeley and John Jones were \r\nchosen as Teacher and Pastor (now called Minister), respectively, as each church \r\nwas supposed to have two elders.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Concord did not prove the paradise anticipated by the town&#8217;s inhabitants.&#160; \r\nEstablishment of new farms and a new community in the midst of the New England \r\nwilderness required enormous effort by all. The second winter was even harsher \r\nthan the first.&#160; Going barefoot in the summer, as many had to do, was bad \r\nenough, but many lacked shoes even in the cold winter.&#160; Snow came early and \r\ndisappeared late in the spring.&#160; For several years late spring frosts killed \r\nsome of the early crops, and the subsequent summers were often wet and cool, \r\nwhich resulted in rotten grain.&#160; Fish were abundant, but wolves often dug up the \r\nfish placed around corn hillocks to fertilize the new corn.&#160; Flooding by the \r\nriver often destroyed crops planted in the fertile soil of the flood plain.&#160; The \r\nmeadow grass proved too rich for the cattle and many became sick.&#160; Hogs escaped \r\nfrom Hogpen Walk and were killed and eaten by lynx.&#160; In these harsh conditions \r\nmany children died.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Concord was severely affected and the small population could no longer \r\nsupport two ministers. At the same time, victory over the fierce Pequot Indians \r\nin Connecticut opened its interior to safe passage.&#160; In 1639 the newly \r\nestablished town of Fairfield, Connecticut, needed a new minister.&#160; A separation \r\ntook place in Concord and Reverend Jones led a sizable group overland to \r\nFairfield in 1644. Only thirty families remained in Concord, but the winter \r\nfollowing this first mass exodus was warm, and the new town survived and \r\ngradually grew in population.</p>\r\n<p>After the exodus of 1644 a new problem arose affecting all of Massachusetts.&#160; \r\nCromwell&#8217;s victory in the English Civil War resulted in the downfall of King \r\nCharles and his Archbishop Laud.&#160; In Massachusetts, ministers exulted the \r\nvictory from the pulpit. The striking changes in England, however, meant that \r\nthe main cause of emigration ceased and, accordingly, shipping both to and from \r\nEngland fell off sharply.&#160; Conditions worsened as prices for cattle and timber \r\nfell, while prices for imported necessities rose alarmingly.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Peter became an even more important leader of the colony. He often fulfilled \r\nspecial tasks for the leadership in Boston, such as investigating high prices \r\nand assembling and publishing the laws of the colony.&#160; He was the first of six \r\nprominent men in the colony to turn down Oliver Cromwell&#8217;s offer to found a \r\nPuritan stronghold in Ireland with aid from England. These men preferred to \r\nremain in New England and handle the many challenges in their own colony.</p>\r\n<p>Peter lost one battle in the town. He could not get the town fathers to \r\nsupport a schoolmaster, a requirement for towns with more than fifty \r\nhouseholders.&#160; They preferred to pay the five pound fine levied each year by the \r\nGeneral Court, because they felt their children should work and help support the \r\nfamily rather than attend school. Many of the literate settlers raised children \r\nwho, as adults, could not sign their names on land deeds.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>On another matter, the support of Harvard College, he fared better. Some \r\nforty-two citizens pledged five pounds annually for seven years to support the \r\nnew college.&#160; The citizens also sent their ablest sons to the Harvard. John \r\nBulkeley, son of Peter, was one of nine young men who made up the first \r\ngraduating class.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Peter&#8217;s most important work, The Covenant of Grace Opened, was published in \r\n1646.&#160; In it Peter expressed some of his most sincere religious ideas.&#160; A small \r\nportion is extracted here:</p>\r\n<p>Whatever salvation and deliverance God gives unto his people, his setting \r\nthem free from this misery, he doth it be virtue of, and according to his \r\nCovenant.</p>\r\n<p>God conveys his salvation by way of covenant, and he doth it those onely that \r\nare in covenant with him . . . this covenant must every soule enter into, every \r\nparticular soule must enter into a particular covenant with God; out of this Way \r\nthere is no life.&#160; In the covenant of works a man is left to himselfe, to stand \r\nby his own strength.&#160; But in the Covenant of Grace, God undertakes for us, to \r\nkeep us through faith.&#160; God comes and sayes; For my owne sake will I do thus and \r\nthus unto you in an absolute promise; here is a ground for the faith of \r\nadherence to cleave unto . . . There be also conditional promises (He that \r\nbelieveth shall be saved) by meanes of which (we having the experience and \r\nfeeling of such grace in our selves) we grow to an assurance that we are of \r\nthose that he will shew that free grace upon.&#160; Now we can never know the things \r\nwhich are given unto us of God, but by knowing of the covenant which conveys all \r\nthe blessings which God doth impart unto his people. ... </p>\r\n<p>We (in New England) are as a city set upon a hill, in the open view of all \r\nthe earth.&#160; The eyes of the world are upon us, because we professe ourselves to \r\nbe a people in Covenant with God. [xi] </p>\r\n<p>While this covenant was Peter&#8217;s major written product, he also authored many \r\nsermons and short poems.&#160; A year before his death in 1657 he wrote the following \r\npoem: [xii] </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">I&#8217;ve reached the evening of my mortal day;<br>A \r\nsluggish mass of clay is this my frame;<br>Yet grant, O God, that while I live, \r\nI may<br>Live to the glory of thy holy name.<br>And if in life I may not honour \r\nThee,<br>From such dishonour may Death set me free.<br>Whether within Thy holy \r\ncourts below<br>I preach salvation unto dying men&#8212;<br>Or in Thine Upper Temple, \r\nwith the flow<br>Of angel-quirings blend my raptured strain&#8212;<br>Living or dying, \r\nThine I still would be:<br>My life and death alike are due to Thee.</p>\r\n<p>Peter wrote his will April 14, 1658, and later added two codicils, the second \r\nof which was prepared shortly before he died on March 9, 1659. [xiii]&#160;&#160; In it he \r\nstates that his estate is &#8220;very little in comparison of what it was, when I came \r\nfirst to this place,&#8221; for he had borne a disproportionate share of town expenses \r\nduring the formative years. His estate was significant despite his introductory \r\nremarks in the will. Peter was undoubtedly buried in Concord&#8217;s Old Hill Burying \r\nGround, likely in the old unlabelled crypt at the southeast corner of the \r\ncemetery, which still remains.</p>\r\n<p>Bulkeley Descendancy Chart </p>\r\n<p>ENDNOTES</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>[i] Information in this introduction taken from Donald Lines Jacobus, 1933, \r\nThe Bulkeley Genealogy, an excellent book detailing not only Peter&#8217;s descendants \r\nbut his ancient ancestry as well.&#160; This book was a major forward step in \r\ngenealogy because of&#160; the author&#8217;s meticulous footnoting of the evidence used.&#160; \r\nIt also made use of F.W.

The first record we have of Phebe is when, on 27 \r\nNovember 1774, she confessed to fornication, owned the covenant, and had her \r\nchild John baptized at Hopkinton, Mass.

There is no clue to the identity of this child&#8217;s \r\nfather, whether Kimmens (or Cummings?) was Phebe&#8217;s maiden name, or whether she \r\nwas using the name of John&#8217;s father.</p>\r\n<p>Phebe next appears in Templeton, Mass., where (as Phebe &#8220;Skimins&#8221;) she \r\nmarried (int.) 27 July 1779 William Coolidge (born at Bolton 25 Sept. 1758, son \r\nof Philip and Lydia [Foskett] Coolidge), a Revolutionary soldier (E.K.

His Revolutionary pension, paid twice a year, was $47.75 (E.K \r\nWhitcomb, <em>About Bolton </em>[1988], p. 323). William and Phebe&#8217;s daughter \r\nLydia was baptized at Templeton 15 April 1781; a son Daniel was born at Bolton, \r\nMass. 18 Jan 1785.

Daniel moved from Weare, N.H. in 1821 \r\nto New York City, where he was a bookseller and binder, at least part of this \r\ntime at a site &#8220;[now] under Brooklyn Bridge,&#8221; according to Esther K. Whitcomb&#8217;s \r\nson, who attempted to locate information about Daniel for his mother. Daniel&#8217;s \r\naddress in 1846 was 38 Rose Street. That Daniel Coolidge was a Quaker is evident \r\nfrom his letter of 7 June 1846 to Keziah Houghton. He may have owned or lost \r\nproperty on &#8220;Fair-Mount&#8221; in South Bolton, and his reference in the same letter \r\nto &#8220;Four Thousand Dollars when General Jackson took so much &#8216;Responsibility Upon \r\nhimself&#8221; prob. refers to the bank failures of the 1830s.

Could this Grandfather Phillips be connected to Daniel&#8217;s mother, our \r\nunplaced Phebe? This Kimmens research led me to some interesting discoveries \r\nabout a tangentially-related family.</p>\r\n<p>Phebe&#8217;s daughter-in-law, Judith Houghton, had a brother James who on 8 \r\nSeptember 1789 had published intentions at Bolton to marry a Beckey Dunton whose \r\nbirthdate and parentage were not known. Following these Dunton-Phillips \r\nconnections led eventually to Ebenezer Dunton of Southborough, Mass. Although \r\nthe findings below would seem to rule him out as the father of Phebe Kimmens, \r\nthe stories of his heretofore-unknown children are an interesting study of what \r\ncan be found by research in deeds and town poor records.</p>\r\n<p>Ebenezer Dunton was most likely the child of that name born at Dorchester, \r\nMass. 3 April 1720 to Ebenezer and Sarah (Royall) Dunton <em>(A Report of the \r\nBoston Record Commission, </em>vol. 21, <em>Dorchester Births, Marriages and \r\nDeaths to the End of 1825 </em>[1891], p. 67).<em> </em>Details of his life are \r\nsketchy, but he must be the Ebenezer Dunton, &#8220;oncapabel of Labore fore almost \r\nfore weekes,&#8221; who petitioned the selectmen of Southborough 4 March 1761 as a \r\npoor person, &#8220;my Provisions allmost spent a Number of small children to maintain \r\nwhich depen on my labors for mantananc&#8221; (Southborough, Mass. Town Records: \r\nWelfare, LDS Roll #861098). Ebenezer apparently died at Southborough prior to 18 \r\nSeptember 1771, when his widow Lydia requested that Nathaniel Dunton be named \r\nadministrator of his estate <em>(Worcester Co. Probate #A:18056). </em>Ebenezer \r\nhad married (1), at Southborough, 19 March 1744/5 Rebecka Lyscum, born at \r\nMarlborough, Mass. <em>7 </em>March 1726, died at Southborough 13 August 1752, \r\ndaughter of Samuel and Mary (Clark) Lyscum. Four sons of this couple were \r\nrecorded at Southborough before Rebeckah&#8217;s death: Ebenezer, Nathaniel, Reuben \r\nand Samuel. Whether there were any other children is not known, but there may \r\nperhaps be room for one other between Reuben (birthdate unrecorded) and Samuel, \r\nborn in 1752. Ebenezer married (2) at Southborough 6 August 1753 Lydia Bellows, \r\nborn there 30 April 1729, daughter of Thomas and Martha (Maverick) Bellows. \r\nAlthough none of the children of Ebenezer&#8217;s second marriage are recorded, \r\nWorcester County deeds show that he and Lydia had at least six.</p>\r\n<p>Ebenezer&#8217;s probate file contains virtually no information about his family, \r\nand lacks a distribution. On 30 May 1773, &#8220;Nathaniel Dunton of Marlborough, \r\nyeoman, lately of Southboro, administrator on the estate of his honored Father \r\nEbenezer Dunton deceased&#8221; sold to Nathan Fay of Southboro, for the sum of 13 \r\npounds 6 shillings and 8 pence, a tract of land in Southboro containing 13 acres \r\nand 70 rods <em>(Worcester Co. Deeds </em>73:3).</p>\r\n<p>On 28 October 1773 Lydia (Bellows) Dunton married (2) at Southborough, as a \r\nsecond wife, Ebenezer Phillips, a neighbor in Southborough (for his ancestry, \r\nsee G.B. Roberts, <em>Ancestors of American Presidents, </em>prelim. ed. rev. \r\n[1989], pp. 97, 99, 133 [Ebenezer&#8217;s sister Joanna (Phillips) Fay was an ancestor \r\nof President George H.W. Bush] and <em>NEXUS </em>8[1991]:32; for his family, see \r\nA.M. Phillips, <em>Phillips Genealogies </em>[1885], pp. 106-7). Again, no \r\nchildren of this Ebenezer and Lydia are recorded; Ebenezer Phillips, however, \r\nhad children by first wife Hannah Lyscom, a sister of Ebenezer Dunton&#8217;s first \r\nwife, Rebecca Lyscom (Hannah, born at Marlborough 29 April 1722, is erroneously \r\ngiven in <em>Phillips Genealogies </em>above, p. 107, as daughter of Israel of \r\nMarlborough, but VRs show the Hannah born that date as daughter of Samuel and \r\nMary). No death date for Ebenezer Phillips has yet been found, but he evidently \r\n[<strong>20</strong>] died ca. 1778-79; Lydia, called &#8220;of Templeton,&#8221; married (3) \r\nWinchendon, Mass. 14 October 1779, as his third wife, Robert Bradish, probably \r\nthe Robert Bradish born at Marlborough 21 November 1712, who died at Athol, \r\nMass. [__] June 1792, son of James and Damaris (Rice) Bradish. A death record \r\nfor the much-married Lydia (Bellows) (Dunton) (Phillips) Bradish has yet to be \r\nfound (although an unnamed &#8220;&#8230;Bradish, wid[ow]&#8221;, died at Leicester 13 March 1819, \r\nae. 89).</p>\r\n<p>Three Worcester County deeds shed light on the &#8220;hidden family&#8221; of Ebenezer \r\nand Lydia (Bellows) Dunton:</p>\r\n<p>1. On 13 December 1784 Ebenezer Dunton and Samuel Dunton of Athol, Reuben \r\nDunton of Shrewsbury, David Dunton and Samuel Bradish with Hannah his wife, and \r\nNathan Stoddard with Lydia his wife of Winchendon, Levi Dunton of Leicester, all \r\nin the County of Worcester and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Nathaniel Dunton \r\nof Stafford, Connecticut and James Dunton of Fitzwilliam, New Hampshire, in \r\nconsideration of the sum of &#163;27 paid to them by Nathan Fay of Southborough, sold \r\nthe said Nathan Fay &#8220;about seventeen acres of land lying in said Southborough \r\n... being part of the lands which Ebenezer Dunton late of said Southborough \r\ndeceased died seized and possessed of and which descended to us the aforenamed \r\ngrantors as we are children to the said deceased and heirs to his estate with \r\nother children of said deceased&#8221; <em>(Worcester Co.

Soldiers and \r\nSailors in the Revolution </em>5 [1899]:73-74, including a &#8220;descriptive list of \r\ndeserters from the Corps of Guards, Morristown, N.J.,&#8221; which describes Levi as \r\nage 25, 5&#8217;7&#8221;, dark complexion, engaged for the town of Marlborough, deserted 4 \r\nJuly 1779). Levi, then a resident of Harvard, Mass., ae. 62, with seven \r\nchildren, first applied for a pension 15 April 1818. He stated that he belonged \r\nto Capt. Daniel Barnes&#8217;s co. in the 15th Massachusetts Regt. commanded by Col. \r\nTimothy Bigelow &#8220;part of the time&#8221; and was afterward in Gen. Washington&#8217;s life \r\nguard and left the service at the end of his three-year enlistment.

Levi stated that he had &#8220;formerly \r\nbeen assisted by the town of Southborough in said Worcester County, and unless \r\nmy pension be continued I must have assistance from the charity of the town [of \r\nBolton]&#8221; (Pension Appl. #34281).

However, if you have some \r\nextra time on your hands, there are two other noteworthy repositories in the \r\nimmediate area that may help you add a tiny twig or two to your family tree. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Start at the Boston Public Library in Copley Square, just a very short walk \r\nfrom the NEHGS Library. Here you will find a goldmine of research materials and \r\nfascinating historical collections, including</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>An extensive collection of colonial United States and Massachusetts \r\nnewspapers from 1704 </li>\r\n<li>Indexes to obituaries published in selected Boston and New England \r\nnewspapers (1740-1840, 1875-present) </li>\r\n<li>City directories </li>\r\n<li>Land and probate records </li>\r\n<li>Passenger arrival lists </li>\r\n<li>Indexes to the genealogical columns published in the <em>Boston \r\nTranscript</em> and <em>Hartford</em> (CT) <em>Times</em> </li>\r\n<li>An index of family coats-of-arms, chiefly from the British Isles, with over \r\n20,000 entries </li>\r\n<li>New England Naturalization Petitions Index, 1790-1906 </li>\r\n<li>City of Boston Lists of Residents (Voter Lists), 1861-present </li>\r\n<li>Plymouth Colony Records, 1633-1692 </li>\r\n<li>Extensive military records</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Especially worthwhile is the Boston Pictorial Archive, which contains the \r\ncountry's largest collection of early Boston photographs. The BPL also has many \r\nphotographs from the Civil War, image collections of the American West, and the \r\nentire archives of the old <em>Boston Herald Traveler</em> (500,000 images from \r\n1906-1972). The archive is organized into both biographical and subject files, \r\nand cover local, national, and international subjects. You never know, your \r\nancestor may be in there somewhere.</p>\r\n<p>If you feel like a little light reading, the library's rare book and \r\nmanuscripts collections are home to the entire library of President John Adams \r\n(3,209 volumes). But that might distract you from your research (and chances \r\nare, the staff won't let you thumb through these volumes anyway!). Although the \r\nrarest titles and manuscripts in these collections are only accessible to \r\nserious researchers, the library's official policy is that \"each request is \r\njudged on its own merits.\" Items that may be of interest to genealogists \r\ninclude:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Elijah Adlow Papers</strong><br>Contains over 10,000 legal documents relating \r\nto Suffolk County and Massachusetts, starting before the Revolution.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Colonial Court Records </li>\r\n<li>Supreme Judicial Court records </li>\r\n<li>Writs of attachment and execution </li>\r\n<li>Criminal complaints </li>\r\n<li>Prisoner lists</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Ellis Ames Collection</strong><br>About 2,000 letters and documents detailing \r\nlegal cases, deeds, and other related subjects in nineteenth century \r\nMassachusetts.

The 2,500-item \r\ncollection is focused on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and includes \r\nmuch ephemeral material from this time. Printed items are now online and may be \r\nsearched on the computer.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Student catalogs, publications, and photographs </li>\r\n<li>Volumes of admissions </li>\r\n<li>Attendance records </li>\r\n<li>Student correspondence </li>\r\n<li>Books by or belonging to former students </li>\r\n<li>Records of the Boston Latin School Association. <br></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>City Directories</strong><br>The library has about 13,000 directories from \r\nacross the country, including bound Boston directories from 1809 to the present. \r\nThe earliest one on microfilm is dated 1789. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Mellen Chamberlain Collection of Autographs </strong><br>In addition to his \r\nastounding collection of autographs, former BPL Librarian Mellen Chamberlain \r\nalso gathered manuscripts from the end of the fifteenth century through the \r\nnineteenth century. In all there are about 20,000 letters, documents, portraits, \r\nautographs, and engravings in the collection, mostly relating to history and \r\nliterature.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Map Collection</strong> includes about 500 atlases and 2,300 rare and early \r\nmaps of Europe, the Americas, and the world.<br><br><strong>20th Regiment Collection \r\n</strong><br>This collection, primarily containing materials relating to the Civil \r\nWar and Massachusetts, was established from funds donated by the 20th Regiment \r\nAssociation of Volunteer Infantry. </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Regimental histories </li>\r\n<li>General Orders of the various Departments of the Union Army </li>\r\n<li>Nine portfolios of the battle and camp photographs by Mathew Brady and \r\nAlexander Gardner </li>\r\n<li>Diaries, reports, and letters provided by the 20th Regiment Association \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Items from the War of 1812, the Mexican War, official records of the 1st and \r\n2nd Divisions of the American Expeditionary Force, and 345 volumes of personal \r\nnarratives on World War I. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you need a diversion from your research, walk around and get acquainted \r\nwith this beautiful facility. The library consists of two buildings, one older \r\nand the other more modern. The research library is the older one, opened in \r\n1895. The many architectural details are sure to catch your eye, as will the \r\nJohn Singer Sargent Gallery, whose mural \"Judaism and Christianity\" dominates \r\nthe third-floor gallery. And while we are on the subject of art, be sure and \r\ntour the Puvis de Chavannes Gallery, named after the French artist who painted \r\nwonderful murals for the second floor corridor; the gorgeous Abbey Room, which \r\nfeatures <em>The Quest of the Holy Grail</em> by American artist Edwin Austin \r\nAbbey; and the Wiggin Room, which displays the Albert H. Wiggin collection of \r\nprints and drawings. There are so many magnificent rooms to explore and \r\nbeautiful architecture and art to admire that you may forget what you came here \r\nfor. If that is the case, you may wish to take the guided \"<a href=\"http://www.bpl.org/guides/tours.htm%20target=new\">Art and Architecture \r\nTour</a>\" that the library offers. Whatever you decide, you should stop and take \r\na breather in the lovely interior courtyard found by the main staircase. </p>\r\n<p>A mile west from the BPL and past the Prudential Center you will find the \r\nMassachusetts Historical Society Library. The society was formed in 1791 and its \r\nlibrary, according to its website, \"serves primarily as a repository for \r\ncollections of the personal papers of individuals and families who lived in \r\nMassachusetts.\"</p>\r\n<p>The manuscript collections are the heart of the MHS holdings, and they keep \r\nover 3,200 such collections comprising more than 10 million pages. Most of these \r\nare personal and family papers, but they also keep some institutional and \r\nbusiness records. The most important of these collections are the John Adams \r\nfamily papers (over 250,000 pages) and the Coolidge Collection of Thomas \r\nJefferson manuscripts.</p>\r\n<p>That is all fascinating, you might say, but what is there for me? Well, while \r\nthe focus of the Society is more on history than genealogy, there are plenty of \r\nopportunities for the two paths to cross. It is always good practice for \r\ngenealogists to know as much as possible about the history of the place being \r\nresearched, and if that place is Boston (or anywhere in Massachusetts), you \r\ncannot beat the Massachusetts Historical Society. </p>\r\n<p>First-time visitors will be asked to fill out a registration form and present \r\nvalid photo identification. Whenever a collection is available in microtext or a \r\nform other than the original (many manuscript collections have been filmed), \r\nvisitors must use the copies instead of the originals. Visitors may only bring \r\npersonal computers into the reading room. MHS staff will provide pencils and \r\nnotepaper.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Books</strong><br>The MHS General Research Collection includes about 12,000 \r\nbiographies and over 10,000 local histories primarily covering the history of \r\nMassachusetts from the time of European settlement to the present.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Family History Resources</strong><br>As quoted from the MHS website: \"While the \r\nMHS has strong collections of published biographical, genealogical, and local \r\nhistory information that support research on its manuscript collections, its \r\nholdings do not duplicate the exhaustive family and New England local history \r\ncollections or services provided by The New England Historic Genealogical \r\nSociety. Researchers working primarily on family history should consult the \r\ncollections of the NEHGS first.\" </p>\r\n<p>That being said, you will want to pay attention to the part of the statement \r\nclaiming that the holdings of the MHS do not duplicate those of NEHGS - yet \r\nanother great reason for researchers to explore the collections at MHS.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pamphlets</strong><br>\"Almost every facet of 19th- and early-20th-century life \r\nin Massachusetts, and to a lesser extent in New England, appears in contemporary \r\npamphlet literature.\" The MHS keeps approximately 25,000 pamphlets from 1820 to \r\nthe present, covering a wide range of subjects. Among the titles: \"Smith's \r\nanimadversions upon, and refutations of sundry gross errors, mistakes and \r\nblunders, contained in a certain pamphlet handed about in this government, in \r\nthe form of a sermon or speech\" and \"An answer to the pamphlet entituled The \r\nconduct of the Paxton men, impartially represented: [microform] : wherein the \r\nungenerous spirit of the author is manifested, &amp;c. And the spotted garment \r\npluckt off,\" which apparently denounced \"the Paxton men\" as murderers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Early Imprint Collection</strong><br>This collection consists of books and \r\npamphlets printed before 1820 and broadsides and newspapers printed before 1821. \r\nHighlights of the collection include the first historical account published in \r\nEnglish-speaking North America (1645), the first Bible printed in any language \r\nin America (1663), and the first American anti-slavery tract (1700).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Map Collection<br></strong>The MHS map collection consists of more than 5,000 \r\nmaps and charts, mainly of Boston, the state of Massachusetts, and New \r\nEngland.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Photograph Collection</strong><br>There are more than 100,000 images in the \r\nphotograph collections of the MHS. These are divided into roughly 200 separate \r\ncollections. Photographs of individuals and families make up the bulk of the \r\ncollections. Included are hundreds of daguerreotypes, tintypes, ambrotypes, and \r\ncabinet cards as well as thousands of carte-de-visite portraits and glass plate \r\nnegatives.</p>\r\n<p>So there you have it. Between the Boston Public Library, the Massachusetts \r\nHistorical Society, and of course, the NEHGS Research Library, you should find \r\nmore than enough reasons to spend a research day (or ten) in the Back Bay. \r\nPlease consult the Plan a Trip to Boston page on this website to find hotel and \r\ndining information.

The first of these volumes covers the seventeenth century and is the most comprehensive as it includes records from both the town clerk and the First Church. The other volumes cover primarily the eighteenth century and contain only the records of births and marriages from the town records (the town did not keep death records during this time period). Marriages are the most complete of these records since they were considered a civil function that could be performed by justices of the peace as well as ministers. Both justices of the peace and ministers were required to send information on the marriages they performed to the town clerk. As the eighteenth century progressed, fewer and fewer births were being recorded with the town clerk in Boston and baptism records from the many Boston churches became a very important source for researchers. </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Boston Record Commissioners' Series: </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Vol. 9, Births, Baptisms, Marriages, and Deaths, 1630-1699 (1883). </p>\r\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Vol. 21, Births From A.D. 1700 to A.D. 1800 (1894). </p>\r\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Vol. 28, Marriages From 1700 to 1751 (1898). </p>\r\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Vol. 30, Marriages From 1752 to 1809 (1903). </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Robert J.

It contains all the death information given, such as name, death or burial date, age, relationships, and the source in which it was found.

Therefore the baptisms recorded in Boston churches become very important to researchers. Church records may also have admissions and dismissions that can help track where a family came from and where they went. Within the records of the New North Church from 1719 to1799 are many admissions and dismissions to and from other Boston churches and from churches in 48 other towns. Most of these towns were in Massachusetts in the counties of Essex, Middlesex, Worcester, Bristol, and Barnstable. However, also included were towns in Connecticut, Maine, and New Hampshire as well as Huntington, Long Island, and Marietta, Ohio. And then there was William Downs who was received by dismission from a church in London. Others in these records had comments associated to them such as \"was removed having joined the Baptists,\" \"had gone over to the Church of England,\" and \"formerly of the English Church.\" </p>\r\n<p><strong>Publications</strong></p>\r\n<p>Robert J. Dunkle and NEHGS are preparing a CD that will include the baptisms, admissions, dismissions, marriages, and deaths from the following Boston churches that were organized before 1800: Hanover Street Methodist Episcopal Church, Second Baptist Church, First Baptist Church, New South Church, New Jerusalem Church, First Presbyterian Church (now Arlington Street Church), Second Church, Christ Church, Hollis Street Church, King's Chapel, New Brick Church, New North Church, Old South Church, and Third Church of Roxbury.&#160; Be sure to watch for the announcement of its release. </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Publications of The Colonial Society of Massachusetts<br><br>Vols. 39, 40, &amp; 41 (1961), Richard D.

Often the name of the minister who married a couple is listed in town's marriage records. This list will help identify which church he served and may just lead you to the church to which your ancestors belonged. For the colonial period, Frederick Lewis Weis'<em> The Colonial Clergy and the Colonial Churches of New England</em> (1936) will help you identify with which church a particular minister was connected at a particular time. </p>\r\n<p>In 1889, Carroll D. Wright published his <em>Report on the Custody and Condition of the Public Records of Parishes, Towns, and Counties </em>which surveyed the records of both existing and extinct churches in Massachusetts. This publication may help you determine what records were then available for a particular Boston church and whether there may be records for an extinct church to which your family may have belonged. If your family belonged to a Congregational church, then check Harold Field Worthley&#8217;s <em>An Inventory of the Records of the Particular (Congregational) Churches of Massachusetts</em> (rev. ed. 1975). Worthley gives a brief history of each church, what records exist, which records have been published, and where the unpublished records may be found (still with the church or in an archive or historical society).

MacLean", "country": "Massachusetts", "title": "Resources for Researching Massachusetts Slaves and Slaveholders", "content": "<p>With slave ships arriving in the 1630s and accounts suggesting that Samuel \r\nMaverick owned slaves here beginning in the 1620s, Massachusetts was the first \r\nNew England colony to keep slaves. Whether a slave, a slaveholder, or an \r\nancestor who lived in a society that allowed slavery, historical records help to \r\nreveal their stories. Reports from 1754 listing the number of slaves over the \r\nage of sixteen are available on microfilm at the Massachusetts Archives for each \r\nMassachusetts town: There were 647 males and 342 females just in Boston, where \r\nthe first African slave had arrived by 1638. The report for Hanover, however, is \r\nparticularly interesting, as it also gives the names of the masters and the ages \r\nof the slaves they owned. By 1765, about 2.1 percent of the overall population \r\nof Massachusetts was identified in a census either as Negro or mulatto, both \r\nfree and slave. Many communities near the coast had the highest percentages of \r\nAfrican Americans, including Boston's 5.2 percent, and Cambridge at 5.7 percent. \r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>By using a number of sources, we can often learn the names of slaves \r\n(commonly referred to as \"Negro servants\" or \"servants\" in the records), the \r\nidentities of those individuals who owned slaves, and something about the story \r\nof slavery in the households and communities of Massachusetts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Town and Church Vital Records</strong></p>\r\n<p>Vital records are a good place to start, although Massachusetts records for \r\nslaves are very incomplete. Slaves could be baptized, providing some church \r\nbaptism records, and they could be married. Marriages had to be by the consent \r\nof their masters, and often the married couple lived in different households and \r\neven in different towns, perhaps getting together at church on Sundays or when \r\nthey were so allowed by their masters.</p>\r\n<p>The standard \"to 1850\" series of Massachusetts vital records are familiar to \r\nmany researchers, but in looking alphabetically through those volumes for an \r\nancestor's surname, it is easy to overlook the fact that at the end of each \r\nBirth, Marriage, and Death section, there will often be a category for \r\nindividuals whose surnames are unknown (which might include former slaves) as \r\nwell as a category entitled \"Negroes.\" Researching Reverend James Chandler of \r\nRowley's second parish (now Georgetown), for example, you would miss some \r\npertinent information if you did not check the latter entries in the <em>Vital \r\nRecords of Rowley</em>. You will find under births: \"Phillis, d&#8230;.Cesar and \r\nSabina, 'negroes joined in wedlock and servants to James Chandler.' [born]&#8230;Mar. \r\n13, 1756.\" Then, listed under marriages is: Chandler, Philis, and Cicero Green \r\nof Newburyport, Mar. 11, 1783.\" Going to the <em>Vital Records of \r\nNewburyport</em>, one discovers that she later remarried: \"Green, Phillis [of \r\nRowley, int.], and Titus Odiorne, Mar. 14, 1793.\"<sup>1</sup> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Probate and Land Records</strong></p>\r\n<p>Probate records also can be a rich source of information on slaves. Some \r\nwills mention slaves and who would inherit them, and a few wills provide for \r\nmanumission. Indeed, one of the most interesting examples is the 1787 will of \r\nRowley's Reverend James Chandler. Chandler wrote of his slave, Sabina: \"I commit \r\nto my said Wife my Negro Woman Sabina, not to be by her sold out of the House, \r\nbut to serve her; and to be provided for by her, as is mete. But if said Sabina \r\nshall live to be a Burden, which my said Wife shall think too Heavy for her to \r\nbear, my Will is&#8212;that my Executor assist in providing for her, as is fitting for \r\nan aged Servant that has been faithful.\"<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<p>Chandler further directed on Sabina's daughter Phillis:</p>\r\n<p>\"To My Negro Woman Phillis I give her Manumission or Freedom and five Pounds \r\nlawful Money, a Chest, &amp; Such other Things in my House, as are known by the \r\nFamily to be her Things. I give her also the Bed that her Mother &amp; She lodge \r\nin and all the Bedding belonging to it. And I hereby testify that I gave her her \r\nFreedom when she was eighteen years old [in 1774], and covenanted with her that \r\nif she would live &amp; Serve in my Family I would give her one Pound &amp; Six \r\nShillings &amp; eight Pence pr year for her Service &amp; find her her Clothes. \r\nShe has lived with, and Served me ever since and I have paid her Nothing of the \r\nMoney that I promised as her wages therefore I owe it to her and order my \r\nExecutor to pay it to her. I Suppose that my keeping her Child [whose birth was \r\nnot recorded in the vital records] more than answers for Interest, but I release \r\nwhat more it might be reckond of.<sup>3</sup> \"</p>\r\n<p>Slaves were mentioned in probate inventories more often than in wills. \r\nInventories listed the number of slaves a person owned, itemized their worth, \r\nand sometimes contained a slave's name. During the French and Indian War, for \r\nexample, the 1757 inventory for the estate of Reverend John Cotton of Newton \r\nstated that he owned: \"Quartus, A Negro Man, that went into his Majesty's \r\nService, and it is uncertain whether he is living or Not,\" and \"Phillis a Negro \r\nWoman upwards of Sixty years of age: an Incumbrance to the Estate.\" (Quartus and \r\nPhillis do not appear in the <em>Vital Records of Newton</em>.)<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<p>Inventory valuations would reflect a slave's age and health, with males \r\ntypically valued higher than females. By comparing these figures with other \r\nitems in the inventory one can see the relative cost of a slave. The 1755 \r\ninventory for Captain John Codman of Charlestown listed five slaves ranging in \r\nvalue from 200 to 500 pounds. By comparison, Codman owned 50 acres in Harvard, \r\nMassachusetts, valued at 5 pounds an acre.<sup>5</sup> </p>\r\n<p>Inventories can also provide a glimpse into the household. Francis Dizer of \r\nCharlestown owned a slave named Charlestown, and the garret of the Dizer \r\nhousehold contained a \"Negro's Cradle Bed &amp; beding.\" Similarly, the 1766 \r\ninventory of Ebenezer Kent, Jr., of Charlestown listed in the garret: \"1 Cribb \r\nand Bead for a Negrow man.\"<sup>6</sup><strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p>Occasionally there were interesting references in probate administration \r\npapers. Within about a year's time during the 1740s, for example, the \r\nadministrator of the estate of Jonathan Gove of Weston purchased two pairs of \r\nshoes, three pairs of stockings, leather britches, four shirts, a wool coat and \r\na wool great coat, and two woolen jackets for the slave Tombo.<sup>7</sup> </p>\r\n<p>Estates of some former slaves also went through probate, such as the 1784 \r\nestate of \"Jack Hatch a negro man late of Lincoln Labourer.\" A former slave in \r\nthat town's Farrar family, Jack had also been known as Jack or John Farrar and \r\nas Jack Freeman. Among the charges against his small estate was an amount \"Due \r\nto Jube Savage (So Calld) for boarding sd. Jack four weeks at 6/ per week in \r\nOctobr. 1781.\" Jube was the former slave of Samuel Phillips Savage of Weston. As \r\na free man Jube had acquired some land and owned a home in \r\nLincoln.<sup>8</sup></p>\r\n<p>Deeds can occasionally be a source for land transactions involving former \r\nslaves, and at least one document of manumission was recorded with the Middlesex \r\ndeeds. Microfilm copies of Massachusetts probate and land records can be found \r\non the fourth floor at the NEHGS Library. Indices for some of the probate \r\nrecords can be searched online at <em>NewEnglandAncestors.org</em>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tax Records</strong></p>\r\n<p>Town Assessors' records are one of the best sources for identifying families \r\nthat owned slaves. These tax lists typically enumerated the number of polls and \r\nthe total value of the personal and real estate for which an individual was \r\ntaxed. In some years, however, the Assessors detailed each item of taxable \r\npersonal property, including the person's productive slaves. Although they did \r\nnot include young or old slaves, and they did not tax ministers (who frequently \r\nowned slaves), collectively these detailed tax lists can provide a fairly \r\ncomplete listing of the slaveholders within a community.</p>\r\n<p>Tax records can be used to document when adult males received their freedom, \r\nas they then paid a poll tax, and sometimes a tax for personal property or real \r\nestate. In Lincoln, for example, former slave Cuff Hoar (Hoar was the surname of \r\nthe family for which he had been a slave) was paying a poll tax by 1778. Like \r\nmany freed slaves, Cuff would soon change his name. In the 1780 tax list the \r\nname \"Cuff Hoar\" was written and then crossed out. His new name of \"Cuff \r\nKneeland\" was written below. Vital records show that Cuff Kneeland married \r\nSudbury's Dinah Young on 1 February 1781, but regrettably he died the following \r\nmonth.</p>\r\n<p>Many tax records are available in the local towns or on microfilm through \r\nFamily History Centers (or borrowed from FHL through the microtext department at \r\nNEHGS). One of the best province-wide sources available in the Society's \r\ncollection is the book, <em>The Massachusetts Tax Valuation List of 1771</em> \r\n(Call # REF F63/P838/1998 also LOAN), which listed a person's \"Servants for \r\nLife.\"</p>\r\n<strong>Diaries and Manuscripts</strong><p>Diaries can contain additional information. Reverend Israel Loring of Sudbury \r\nrecorded for 3 January 1730, \"Dyed Mr. ABRAHAM BRIANT's Negro Servant\"; and then \r\nseventeen days later, \"About Midnight Dyed MICAH STONE's Negro Child.\" Also in \r\nSudbury, Experience (Wight) Richardson wrote in her diary for 5 August 1745: \r\n\"Zilpah my father negro woman died.\" (These three deaths do not appear in the \r\n<em>Vital Records of Sudbury</em>.) <sup>9</sup> </p>\r\n<p>Manuscript collections may contain documents relating to slaves, potentially \r\nincluding a bill of sale. One such document from 1765 reads:</p>\r\n<p>\"I Joshua Brooks&#8230;in consideration of the sum of four pounds&#8230;paid by Josiah \r\nNelson of lincoln, yeoman, in full satisfaction, do hereby sell convey and \r\ndeliver to him&#8230;for ever a sartain Neagro Servant boy Named peter about one year \r\nand seven months old&#8230;.\" </p>\r\n<p>Peter's father was a slave in Lexington, his mother was a slave to Joshua \r\nBrooks in Lincoln, and now Peter was sold into a third \r\nhousehold.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Newspapers</strong></p>\r\n<p>Newspapers provide some revealing resources relating to Massachusetts \r\nslavery, including people engaged in the slave trade. Advertisements for the \r\nsale of slaves appeared in the <em>Boston News-Letter</em>, the first successful \r\nweekly, shortly after the paper began in 1704. An analysis of the <em>Boston \r\nGazette</em> found that there were 1,103 different advertisements for the sale of \r\nslaves between 1719 and 1781, an average of nearly eighteen ads each \r\nyear.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<p>While obituaries were rare in newspapers, it is interesting to note that the \r\nauthor of a 1766 obituary for Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Chambers \r\nRussell considered it important that Russell was \"an uncommon kind and indulgent \r\nMaster; ever considering and treating his Slaves, as being intitled to the \r\nRights of Humanity; and making them in all Respects, as happy as was consistent \r\nwith their State.\"<sup>12</sup> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Revolutionary War to Freedom</strong></p>\r\n<p>Many town histories contain information on slaves in their community, while \r\nstudies such as the NEHGS publication<em> </em><em>History of the Black \r\nPopulation of Amherst, Massachusetts, 1728-1870</em>, by James Avery Smith, or \r\n<em>Prince Estabrook: Slave and Soldier</em>, by Alice M. Hinkle, or the National \r\nPark Service study <em>Patriots of Color: 'A Peculiar Beauty and Merit,' African \r\nAmericans and Native Americans at Battle Road &amp; Bunker Hill</em>, by George \r\nQuintall, Jr., provide important studies of individual contributions to our \r\nshared heritage, including service fighting for the founding of our nation.</p>\r\n<p>In May 1775 the Massachusetts Committee of Safety had adopted a policy \r\nallowing free Negroes to serve in the military, and in April 1778 slaves were \r\nalso allowed to serve if they were given their freedom. Many African Americans \r\nfought, with their participation listed in <em>Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors \r\nof the Revolutionary War</em> and in related documents at the Massachusetts \r\nArchives.</p>\r\n<p>There were many other Massachusetts laws, regulations, and court cases \r\nrelating to slaves, including laws that allowed slaves to bring actions in \r\ncourt. Indeed, two landmark cases, initiated by slaves Quock Walker and Mum Bett \r\n(later known as Elizabeth Freeman), were decided in 1783 and led to the end of \r\nslavery in Massachusetts. While the 1787 will of Reverend Chandler demonstrates \r\nthat slavery did not immediately end throughout the Commonwealth in 1783 (as is \r\noften thought), when the 1790 census was taken, not a single individual in \r\nMassachusetts was classified as a slave.</p>\r\n<div><strong><hr size=\"2\" width=\"100%\" align=\"center\">\r\n</strong></div><p>1.<em> Vital Records of Rowley, Massachusetts, to the End of the Year \r\n1849</em>, Vol. 1 (Salem, 1928), p. 237; Ibid., p. 434; <em>Vital Records of \r\nNewburyport, Massachusetts, to the End of the Year 1849</em>, Vol. 2 (Salem, \r\n1911).</p>\r\n<p>2.

Yet the majority of citizens are \r\nunaware of most of them and what they do. In this article I will profile three \r\nunique groups linked by an educational mission that are worth knowing about. One \r\nof these organizations focuses on students and tourism, another works to educate \r\nindividuals working with museums, historical societies, and historic houses, \r\nwhile the third intends to awaken tourists to Boston's exciting history. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p><strong>Historic Bostons' Partnership </strong></p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.bostonuk.com/historicbostons/\" target=\"_new\">Historic \r\nBostons' Partnership</a> was established in 1999 to \"recognize and celebrate the \r\nunique and important historical connections that exist between Boston in \r\nLincolnshire, England and Boston in Massachusetts.\" One of the founders of the \r\ngroup, Professor Will Holton of Northeastern University, presented a \"plan for \r\nthe foundation of a vital, people-to-people relationship celebrating and \r\nexpanding the rich historical links\" between the two Bostons at the \r\norganization's first meeting. The Partnership seeks to make the public aware of \r\nthat centuries-old history, including the link between the Boston Latin School \r\nin Boston, Massachusetts (1635) and the Grammar School in Boston, Lincolnshire \r\n(1567). <br><br>Indeed, many of the original settlers of Boston, Massachusetts \r\ncame from the Lincolnshire area during the Great Migration, including Simon \r\nBradstreet, John Cotton, and John Winthrop. But did you know that the <a href=\"http://bls.org/\" target=\"_new\">Boston Latin School</a> is the oldest school \r\nin the country, founded on April 23, 1635? The first headmaster of the Boston \r\nLatin School once taught at the Grammar School in Boston, Lincolnshire, \r\ncementing the bond between the two schools. <br><br>The Partnership maintains \r\nthis connection through educational programs via the Internet and curriculum \r\nmaterials. A student exchange program between the two schools is also planned. \r\nSince the two towns have a historical link, it is hoped that a tourism package \r\nwill encourage travelers in both directions. Both Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston, \r\nMA and the Boston (U.K.) Borough Council support the project. </p>\r\n<p>Many outstanding Bostonians attended the Latin School including Leonard \r\nBernstein, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Benjamin Franklin. Franklin left an \r\nendowment to present the top seven graduating seniors with a medal, named after \r\nhim. Today, almost 100 percent of the graduating class goes on to college. One \r\nof the stops on President George Bush's education reform tour on January 8, 2002 \r\nwas the Boston Latin School. </p>\r\n<p>For more information contact:</p>\r\n<p>Will Holton<br>Massachusetts Chairman<br>41 Oriole St.<br>Boston, MA \r\n02132<br><a href=\"mailto:w.holton@neu.edu\">email</a></p>\r\n<p>Judy Cammack<br>Lincolnshire Chairman<br>127 Spilsby Road<br>Boston, \r\nLincolnshire PE 21 9QN</p>\r\n<p><br><strong>Boston History Collaborative</strong><br><br>Boston's role in the American \r\nRevolution is an important part of the curriculum of any American history \r\nteacher, but how many history textbooks include Boston's literary heritage or \r\ntechnological innovations? Executive Director Dr. Robert Krim founded the Boston \r\nHistory Collaborative in 1997. Krim formed a non-profit alliance of historians \r\nfrom area universities; representatives from area museums, historic sites, and \r\nlibraries; members of the Greater Boston tourism industry; city, state, and \r\nfederal officials; and the business community to explore Boston's \"hidden\" \r\nhistory. The goal of Collaborative is to position Greater Boston as one of the \r\nworld's primary destinations for historical tourism by offering visitors and \r\nresidents educational and entertaining programs over a ten-year period. To that \r\nend, they have ambitiously launched a series of projects to meet the goal of \r\npresenting Boston as a different type of tourist destination. </p>\r\n<p>Recently, the Collaborative held a History Makers Award Dinner to honor those \r\nBoston corporations who have made history through their innovations. This year's \r\nrecipients were the Gillette Company for the disposable razor; Genuity, Inc. for \r\nBolt, Beranek, and Newman's development of the Internet; Genzyme, a \r\nbiotechnology firm; and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for \r\nlaboratory-based education. The Boston Red Sox baseball organization won a \r\nCentenary Award.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Boston History Collaborative Projects</strong></p>\r\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.lit-trail.org/\" target=\"_new\">Literary Trail of Greater \r\nBoston</a> is a self-guided twenty-mile tour that showcases some of the \r\ncountry's literary greats such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Alcotts. Start at \r\nthe Omni Parker House Hotel and visit Beacon Hill, Boston Athenaeum, Boston \r\nPublic Library's Bates Hall, Longfellow House, Concord Museum, Orchard House, \r\nand Walden Pond. If you want to learn more about Boston's place in literary \r\nhistory consult Susan Wilson's guidebook <em>The Literary Trail of Greater \r\nBoston</em>, in collaboration with the Boston History Collaborative (Houghton \r\nMifflin, 2000).</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bostonbysea.org/\" target=\"_new\">Boston by Sea</a> consists \r\nof several projects focusing on Boston's maritime heritage. These include three \r\ntypes of Boston Harbor tours--a guided walking tour, a self-guided tour, and a \r\nboat tour that was launched in May 2000. The boat tour includes live theater, \r\nmusic, video, and slides in a performance that stages re-creations of events of \r\ncourage, adventure, and discovery. Visitors can view the USS Constitution, \r\nBoston Light, Fort Warren, the site of the Tea Party, and the Golden Stairs of \r\nImmigration while hearing the stories of historical Boston events. The guided \r\nwalking tour is free and goes along the Long Wharf led by actors dressed in the \r\nstyle of nineteenth-century Boston. The guides show where the British landed in \r\nBoston in their attempt to put down the Revolution, explain the important role \r\nthe Wharf played in the cod trade, and tell the story behind Boston's opposition \r\nto slavery and slave catchers. All of these stories are told right where the \r\nevents occurred. The self-guided walking tour allows visitors to explore \r\nBoston's maritime history at their own pace with a map and informational \r\nbrochure.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bostonfamilyhistory.com/\" target=\"_new\">Boston Family \r\nHistory</a> is a website helping Bostonians and those who migrated through \r\nBoston find their family roots. Boston Family History also features a series of \r\nvirtual trails linked to local ethnic associations and neighborhood historical \r\nsocieties, that touch on Boston's historic places and monuments.. While Boston \r\nis popularly associated with the Irish, this site illustrates the diverse \r\npopulations that have settled in the city.

According to their website, it is a \"non-profit association of \r\nindividuals and organizations such as history museums, historical societies and \r\ncommissions, historic houses and sites\" that promotes \"the enjoyment of history \r\nthrough its preservation, interpretation and presentation.\" So how do they do \r\nthat? Well, the 1949 Massachusetts law that requires state and local history be \r\ntaught in the schools is just one of the League's successes. They also work \r\nclosely with the Massachusetts Historical Commission, the Massachusetts Board of \r\nLibrary Commissioners, and the Massachusetts Historical Resources Advisory \r\nBoard. This means that the League is part of the community of professionals \r\nworking with Massachusetts history both as an institution and on the behalf of \r\nits members.<br><br>Membership is open to both individuals and organizations, \r\nwith rates for the latter pro-rated depending on operating budget. Benefits \r\ninclude <em>Common Wealth</em>, a quarterly newsletter with articles on public \r\nhistory. Membership also includes borrowing privileges to their circulating \r\nlibrary. A list of materials for loan appears on their website. Members also \r\nqualify for discounts on fees for League workshops and seminars. <br><br>A \r\nLeague membership is a must for staff members of historical organizations. They \r\noffer a wide variety of workshops and programs on the types of problems \r\nencountered by these organizations, from caring for historical photographs to \r\ngrant writing. Their membership list is a network of individuals facing similar \r\nissues in non-profit management. An unusual benefit of membership is the lending \r\nof measuring devices that indicate relative temperature and humidity levels in \r\norder to determine whether an institution's facilities meet preservation \r\nstandards. Workshops are regularly held for members on a variety of subjects; \r\nrecent ones have ranged from preservation standards to tips on being an \r\neffective tour guide.</p>\r\n<p>The League recently published two books: <em>Painting Historic Exteriors: \r\nColors, Application, and Regulation</em> (with the Massachusetts Historical \r\nCommission) and Cynthia Robinson and Gretchen S. Sorin's <em>Going Public; \r\nCommunity Program and Project Ideas for Historical Organizations</em>. This is in \r\naddition to working on editions of the <em>Directory of Historical Agencies in \r\nMassachusetts, a Speakers Bureau</em> (with the Center for New England Studies) \r\nand <em>Massachusetts </em>by Judith Freeman Clark. </p>\r\n<p>Who wouldn't want to be part of this vital organization?

Into the twentieth century each town \r\nwas responsible for the care of their \"recognized inhabitants\"; these included \r\nthe needy people born to recognized inhabitants, the women who married \r\nrecognized inhabitants, or those who lived in a town and paid taxes for a \r\ncertain number of years. But by the nineteenth century there were a growing \r\nnumber of people, especially in the cities, who had no connection to any \r\nparticular town, so state resources and some private organizations were formed \r\nto handle those who could not take care of themselves. </p>\r\n<p>All of the records mentioned in this article are available at the <a href=\"http://www.state.ma.us/sec/arc/arcidx.htm\" target=\"_new\">Massachusetts State \r\nArchives </a>and on microfilm through the <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/default.asp\" target=\"_new\">Family History \r\nLibrary </a>. All of the institutions kept various kinds of registers that \r\nrecorded basic information about the patients or inmates, such as name, age, \r\ntown of residence, why they were in the institutions, admission and dismission \r\ndates, etc. At the end of this article I will list those institutions that kept \r\nthese registers, but first I want to discuss those institutions that recorded \r\ncase histories - because such histories yield the most useful information.</p>\r\n<p>In the course of doing research, you may find from family papers that a \r\nkinsman spent some time at one of these institutions. You may find a family \r\nmember living in one of these institutions in a state or federal census, or you \r\nmay find on a death certificate that your kinsman died at one of these \r\ninstitutions. Most of the registers and records of case histories that I \r\nexamined were indexed either in the front or the back of the volume. </p>\r\n<p>Several years ago while transcribing the 1855 and 1865 state censuses of \r\nMassachusetts, I discovered a man named Nothing Particular who was an inmate at \r\nthe Ipswich Insane Asylum in 1855, and at the Tewksbury State Almshouse in 1865. \r\nI was not completely certain that these two entries referred to the same man \r\nuntil I consulted the register of weekly admissions and discharges at the \r\nalmshouse. There it was reported that Nothing Particular, who was transferred to \r\nthe almshouse from the Ipswich Insane Asylum on March 31, 1857, died September \r\n7, 1895, at age 73.</p>\r\n<p>One of the earliest of these organizations was the Boston Female Asylum, \r\nfounded and run by society women in Boston. The available records cover 1800 to \r\n1867. Many mothers and fathers in Boston who could not take care of their \r\ndaughters voluntarily placed them in the Female Asylum. In order to do so, they \r\nwere required to sign the following statement that gave up all their rights to \r\nthese daughters:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>We the Subscribers solicitors that our children should receive the benefits \r\nand advantages of the Boston Female Asylum, and the Board of Managers being \r\nwilling to receive and provide for, and also place them out in virtuous Families \r\nuntill the age of Eighteen years, Agreeable to the rules and regulations of the \r\nSociety, provided we do severally relinguish our children to them, we do hereby \r\npromise not to interfere on the management of them in any respect whatever, nor \r\nvisit them without their consent. And in consideration of their benevolence in \r\nthe receiving and providing for them, we do relinguish all right and claim to \r\nthem and their services, untill they shall arrive to Eighteen years of age. And \r\nseverally engage that we will not ask or receive any compensation for the same, \r\nnor take them from, or induce to leave the Families where they may be placed by \r\nthe Board of managers of the Asylum.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The registers of the children admitted to the Female Asylum record the name \r\nof the child, age or birth date, date of admission, and when and where the child \r\nwas placed. Some children were returned to their families, but most were placed \r\nwith families both in Boston and outside the city. </p>\r\n<p>Examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Lucretia Cochran was admitted to the Female Asylum in October 1853 and \r\nturned over to her mother in April 1854 </li>\r\n<li>Catharine Hall was admitted in March 1827, and was placed with her \r\ngrandmother, Mrs. Mary Page, on October 27, 1841 </li>\r\n<li>Mary Jane and Elizabeth Kelley, admitted in April 1844, were \"Permitted to \r\ngo under the care of Patric Nolan to their father James Kelley of Dublin Ireland \r\n- who sent for them\" in March 1846. </li>\r\n<li>Clara Kingsbury was admitted in August 1860 and placed out in October 1864 \r\nwith Mr. and Mrs. B. Howard of West Bridgewater </li>\r\n<li>Susan Rowson was admitted October 26, 1813 and placed out on January 21, \r\n1821 with Mr. and Mrs. Cox of Portland, Maine </li>\r\n<li>Sarah McIntire was admitted July 31, 1810 and placed out in June 1816 with \r\nEliphalet and Mary Dickenson of Deerfield. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Some siblings were split up, as in these examples: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Arria Sargent Renott and Jane Flagg Renott, who were admitted on March 31, \r\n1812. Arria was placed out in September 1815 with Seth and Ann Terry of \r\nHartford, Connecticut, while Jane was placed out on March 30, 1819 with Rev. S. \r\nSwift and his wife of Nantucket. </li>\r\n<li>Jane Elizabeth King and Helen Josephine King were admitted in March 1857. \r\nJane was placed out in June 1861 with Mr. &amp; Mrs. N. Smith Jr. of Woodbury, \r\nConnecticut, while her sister Helen was returned to their mother in November \r\n1862. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Inevitably, a few of the children died while in the asylum. Rosanna Kenney, \r\nwho was six when she was admitted in August 1854, died January 21, 1857 of \r\nconsumption. Grace McFarlane, who was three years old when admitted on January \r\n24, 1804, died just a few months later on October 8. No cause of death is \r\nlisted.</p>\r\n<p>In the minutes of the Female Asylum meetings one will often find stories \r\ndescribing why children were placed in the institution. Here are several \r\nexamples:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Mrs. May repeated the following representation of a woman from whose lips she \r\nhad a few hours before received it. She was born in Tewksbury, left that place \r\non her marriage, and has since resided in Boston; her husband some months since \r\ndied at sea, leaving her entirely without means of support, with one child, and \r\nin daily expectation of giving birth to the infant which was now in her arms. \r\nHer parents were dead, nor had she any friends in her native town able to \r\ncontribute to her relief. This statement was confirmed by the woman at whose \r\nhouse she had lived, and who joined in soliciting for her oldest child, a \r\ndaughter five years old, admission into the Asylum. Adeline E. Nelson be \r\nadmitted.</p>\r\n<p>A child named Caroline Scholtz, was recommended to the notice of the \r\nBoard...Her situation was thus represented by Mrs. M.L. Smith. Her parents had \r\nlived in very comfortable circumstances untill they became impoverished by the \r\nextreme intemperance and improvidence of her father. The exertions of her \r\nmother, on whom the care of his business and of their numerous family entirely \r\ndevolved, were their only support. She died during the last winter, leaving \r\nseven children to poverty and wretchedness. The charity of friends was exerted \r\nin their behalf, and the child for whom admission into the Asylum was not \r\nsolicited, set to a relative, who herself in indigent circumstances, consented \r\nto keep her untill the next August, in consideration of receiving from her \r\nfather some articles of old furniture as a compensation. At the expiration of \r\nthe next month she would be thrown on the protection of a grandmother, who, at \r\nthe advanced age of eighty two years, procured subsistence by keeping a small \r\nshop; and who already had the charge of two of these orphan children. These \r\ncircumstances, and the strength and fervency of the expressions of gratitude, \r\nwith which this aged and unfortunate woman received information of the \r\nprobability of her grandchild's admittance into the Asylum, were a very powerful \r\nand efficient appeal to the feelings of those, who, unanimously acknowledging \r\nthe claims of age and poverty of childhood and helplessness.</p>\r\n<p>The mother of Selina Sargent died about two years since, leaving five \r\nchildren to the care of an indigent and intemperate father, who was utterly \r\nincapable of performing this duty. The three oldest girls were placed at service \r\nin respectable families; the fourth, a boy, is a wretched wanderer about the \r\nstreets. Selina, the youngest, being, from her extreme youth, incapable of \r\nperforming the service required in a situation like her sisters', remained with \r\nher father, exposed to all the hardships of poverty and all the contagion of \r\nvice. The house in which he lived was occupied by other boarders, of similar \r\ngrade and character to his own. One apartment only was appropriated as the \r\nbed-room of the whole, and one bed contained the little Selina and her abandoned \r\nfather. She has two aunts whose characters render their interposition on her \r\nbehalf much more to be dreaded than wished. Her father is willing to give her up \r\nto this charity, and the yet uncontaminated child may now be saved from the \r\ndestruction to which her present situation seems so inevitably to lead.</p>\r\n<p>Mrs. Codman said she had on the preceding afternoon received the following \r\naccount from a young woman whose very apparent wretchedness gave painful \r\ntestimony to its truth. She has been left a widow with one child; had again \r\nmarried and again became a mother. An illness which prevented her husband from \r\ncontinuing his accustomed employment, brought its usual effect to those whose \r\ndaily support depends on their daily labour. Unable to raise ten dollars for the \r\npayment of a debt he had contracted, he was threatened with imprisonment; to \r\navoid this, though hardly recovered from sickness, he left his family and fled. \r\nHis wife, deserted and in want, is now in daily expectation of giving birth to \r\nanother child. For her oldest girl, the orphan child of her former husband, she \r\nseeks the protection of this society. The name of the woman is Brown, that of \r\nthe child, Mary Grant.</p>\r\n<p>The Committee reported that three children had been admitted. The first, \r\nGeorgianna Conn, was the daughter of a poor widow who was going to support \r\nherself at service if a home could be given to her child. The second, Eliza Howe \r\nSmith, was brought by her mother, an American woman. Her father had belonged to \r\nthe Navy and had been lost at sea, leaving his widow with five little ones to \r\ncare for. Her friends were unable to aid her in the support of all these \r\nchildren and she asked a place in the Asylum for her little girl. The third \r\nchild, Sarah Alice Holbrook, was the daughter of a poor American widow with four \r\nchildren and no means of support. These circumstances being heard, it was Voted \r\nThat the admission of these children is sanctioned by the Board.</p>\r\n<p>Two little girls whose case had been mentioned at the last meeting, had been \r\nadmitted. Their mother, Mrs. Kirk, had not heard from her husband since the \r\nbattle of Gettysburg, and wished a home for the children whom she felt unable to \r\nsupport herself. The admission of Mary Parker and Maria May Kirk was approved by \r\nthe Board.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>State almshouses at Tewksbury and Monson began operation in the second half \r\nof the nineteenth century. The available records for the Tewksbury Almshouse \r\ninclude children's records from 1855 to 1869, inmate case histories from 1860 to \r\n1896, and weekly returns of admissions and discharges from 1894 to 1918.

She was taken by William Stevens, Jr., of Marblehead in \r\nSeptember 1860. A visit on November 20, 1867, to Stevens revealed that she had \r\nstayed with him for four years when he transferred her to his father William \r\nStevens, Sr., where she had been about a year. She was reported to be \" 'below \r\npar' in intellect, not capable of taking care of herself, untruthful &amp; \r\ncareless about her person, rather given to lewdness.\" On November 6, 1868, \r\nMargaret was returned to the Almshouse on account of mental disability. In \r\nJanuary 1869 she was taken on trial by Henry E. Worcester of Tewksbury and a \r\nvisit on March 9, 1869 found \"Margaret happy &amp; contented, likes her place \r\nwell.\"</p>\r\n<p>These records also contain the extraordinary story of George G. Leaverns, \r\nborn in England, who came to Massachusetts in 1844 and was admitted from Lowell \r\non January 10, 1856. He was taken by Mrs. Nathaniel Lowe of Tewksbury on June \r\n24, 1856.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>[emphasis in original] <em>A remarkable case of self education &amp; \r\nperseverance under difficulties</em>. George was with the Lowes about 4 years - \r\nprevious to his going there, while at the almshouse, had the <em>fingers of his \r\nleft hand cut off</em> in a hay cutter; in the army, at <em>battle of \r\nFredericksburg</em>, was shot in the <em>right arm which was amputated at the \r\nshoulder</em>; returned to Maine, after leaving hospital, <em>fitted himself for \r\nCollege; went to college</em>, &amp; is now <em>holding high position as a teacher \r\nat Rochester N.Y. Universal</em>...It appears that his family had originally \r\noccupied a good position in society, but the father died; hard times came upon \r\nthem, the mother &amp; boy had to go to the Almshouse; the mother died there, \r\n&amp; on her death bed got a pledge from the boy that when out of the \r\ninstitution, he would so act all thru life so to gain an honorable name; well \r\nhas George kept his pledge.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Not all of the children's stories turn out so well. Timothy Keenan was put \r\nout to William Babb of North Barrington, New Hampshire, in 1864. When \r\nrepresentatives of the almshouse visited in August 1868, they were told that \r\nTimothy had been with Babb only three or four months when he was returned to Dr. \r\nMcDaniel, who then put him out to George Ham of Stafford, New Hampshire. In \r\nSeptember, the representative \"on my way to Stafford to see Mr. Ham, met a \r\ngentleman...who told me that the boy was not there; had left about 2 years \r\nbefore &amp; that it was a hard place for a child...Mr. Hamm is represented as \r\nbeing not a good master to send children to; he works them too hard &amp; does \r\nnot school them as he ought.\"</p>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/researching-massachusetts-institutions-for-the-poor/", "published": "January 18, 2002", "id": 253}, {"author": "Ann S.

These registers include the patient's name, age, sex, civil condition \r\n(single or married), birthplace, residence, transferred from (usually from the \r\nalmshouse), date of transfer, how supported by state or town, date of discharge, \r\nhow discharged (usually by death), and remarks. When the asylum opened on \r\nOctober 1, 1866, thirteen of the first thirty-five patients admitted were males, \r\ntwenty-two were females, and they ranged in age from fourteen to fifty-five (two \r\nhad no age recorded). Nineteen of the patients were born in Ireland, while \r\nothers were born in England, France, Scotland, Charlestown, Lynn, Cape Breton, \r\nBoston, and Lowell (four had no birthplace recorded). Thirty patients died while \r\nat the asylum, three lived into the twentieth century, and one was transferred \r\nto the Worcester Asylum.</p>\r\n<p>The available records of the state almshouse at Monson contain admission \r\nrecords and case histories from 1854 to 1882. The State Primary School at Monson \r\ncontain case histories from 1864 to 1895; boarding out registers from 1883 to \r\n1892; placement registers from 1874 to 1890; hospital registers from 1854 to \r\n1895; indenture agreements from 1854 to 1890; death registers from 1854 to 1895; \r\nbirth registers from 1854 to 1885; and registers of weekly admissions and \r\ndischarges from 1854 to 1895. This example from Great Barrington shows the basic \r\nform used by towns throughout Massachusetts when sending people to the Monson \r\nalmshouse: </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>September 13, 1871, The Superintendent of State Almshouse, at Monson, Will \r\nplease admit the following person from Great Barrington; name, Angeline \r\nGarrison, age 46, birthplace Hillsdale in State of New York, Came into State \r\n1868, last time; this is signed by the overseers of the poor of Great \r\nBarrington. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Additional questions on this form show that Angeline's parents were Henry and \r\nMary (Makeley) Garrison, born in New York; the father died in Austerlitz, New \r\nYork, and the mother lives in Albany, New York; her grandfather was Jacob \r\nMakeley of Hillsdale.<br>On September 26, 1871, Worcester sent \r\nthree-and-one-half-year-old Alexander Benton, born in Rhode Island, son of \r\nAlexander Benton, to Monson. The back of the form reads: </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>This child was brought to Worcester by His Father who states that the mother \r\nis dead; he was born in one of the Southern States and served in the Rebel Army \r\nduring the war, and is now in Fitchburg Jail under sentence of one Year for \r\nAssault with intent to murder; he married an Irish woman in Worcester, and \r\nafterwards informed her he had another wife in Rhode Island, and all he wanted \r\nfor her was to take care of the child - which she now refuses to \r\ndo.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The admission forms to the State Primary School at Monson are on letterhead \r\nof the \"State Board of Lunacy and Charity, Department of In-Door Poor.\" The form \r\nletter continues as in this example: \"To the Superintendent State Primary \r\nSchool, Dear Sir: Please receive and provide for Mary Godfrey, committed to the \r\ncustody of the Board by Police Court at Springfield, on the third day of \r\nSeptember 1882, for the offence of Neglected.\" At the bottom are explanations of \r\nhow the children came to be sent to the State school, in the manner of the \r\nfollowing examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Mary Godfrey, of Sprague St., W. Springfield. Born Sept. 10, 1877 in \r\nSpringfield. Fa. John [dead], Mo. Ellen. This girl's father is dead and her \r\nmother in jail, Springfield, for drunkenness. She has been arrested several \r\ntimes for this offence. There are two other children, John about 14 years old, \r\nis in the Hampden County Truant school, Charles, about 15 years old is at work \r\nfor the M.U.Tel. Co. in Springfield and is self supporting. After commitment of \r\nthe mother, this girl had no home. She is bright and attractive and should be \r\nplaced out.<br><br></li>\r\n<li>John J. Connors. Father Michael Connors died in 1878. Mother Betsey died in \r\n1879, soon after adopted by Patrick &amp; Rose Keegan. Has had a good home, but \r\ndisposed to take things not his own. On Friday stole a watch chain, rings &amp; \r\nball from a store on E. Main St., Fall River.<br><br></li>\r\n<li>Harry Sheldon of Curtisville, Stockbridge. Born Mch. 1880 in Chatham, N.Y. \r\nFa. Horatio N. - Mo. Maria (dead). This boy with his older brother was before \r\nthe Court at Lee last Jan. 9 as neglected children, but father said he was going \r\nto remove to N.Y. Instead he moved to Stockbridge. He keeps house himself &amp; \r\nworks out on a farm and locks the children out of doors day times. They are \r\nlittle thieves. Have been implicated before. Sat. Oct. 5th they broke into the \r\nhouse of a Mr. Clapper and stole a number of small articles and did quite an \r\namount of mischief. The father is an old man and is said to have been in jail \r\nseveral times. He has very little control over the boys.<br><br></li>\r\n<li>Irene T. Chapman, of Main St., Natick. Born April 1, 1877 in Cochituate. \r\nFather Charles K. Mother, Margaret. The parents of Irene are dead. Father died \r\n1885, Mother 1884. Since their deaths she has been living most of the time with \r\nher maternal grandmother, Mrs. Catherine Martin, 299 North St., Boston. Mrs. \r\nMartin keeps a house of ill-fame and dance hall at that place. On Sept. 15th \r\nIrene ran away from there and went to her paternal grandmother, Mrs. Lucy \r\nChapman in Natick where she has since resided. Irene has a very bad temper and \r\nwhen asked to do anything replies with vile and abusive language. Has thrown \r\nknives and dishes at her grandmother and torn up her bed clothes. Mrs. Chapman \r\nbeing an old lady was in constant fear and for that reason had her complained \r\nof.<br><br></li>\r\n<li>John C. Rochford, born Feb. 23, 1882, Alice J. Rochford, born Feb. 24, 1884, \r\nand Mary E. Rochford, born Aug. 23, 1885, all born in Springfield. Fa. Geo. J., \r\nMo. Mary [dead]. Family have been aided a good deal. About a year ago the father \r\ngot drunk and smashed the furniture and turned his wife out of doors, though \r\nsince there has been but little trouble. The mother died Dec. 7th and the \r\nchildren were found last Wednesday ragged and dirty at the home of their \r\ngrandmother who says she can find places for them but could not show that she \r\nhad found any suitable persons willing to take them.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The school made indenture agreements that placed many children with families \r\nthroughout New England; sample indentures show placements in Massachusetts as \r\nwell as Providence, Rhode Island; Hillsborough, New Hampshire; East Windsor, \r\nConnecticut; and a rare placement in Woodsdale, Butler County, Ohio. The boys \r\nwere in most cases to learn agriculture or farming and the girls housekeeping. \r\nAt the end of their indenture, when the boys were twenty-one and the girls were \r\neighteen, they were to be given a certain sum of money - usually $50 but \r\nsometimes as high as $100 - two suits of clothing, one for the Sabbath and one \r\nfor working days, and sometimes a Bible.</p>\r\n<p>The registers of births contain records of many illegitimate children, but in \r\nmost cases the names of both parents are given. <br>The registers of deaths \r\ncontain the name of the deceased, age, death date, cause of death, parent's \r\nnames, sex, and birthplace. <br>The records of the hospital at the State Primary \r\nSchool contain the name of the patient, age, birthplace, whether single or \r\nmarried, occupation, previous health, habits, color, date of admission, disease, \r\nresult (whether they got well or died), and remarks. For example:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Catherine O'Donnell, 3 1/2 months, born Boston, white, admitted 25 July, \r\nDiarrhea, died 28 July, mother had syphilis </li>\r\n<li>Primus Johnson, 100, born Connecticut, married, black, admitted 23 July, \r\nDiarrhea, got better </li>\r\n<li>John P. Hillman, 40, born New York, married, laborer, previous health good, \r\nhabits bad, white, admitted 24 August, Fracture skull, comatose, died, injured \r\non Railroad.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Monson was also home to the Hospital for Epileptics. The records contain the \r\nname of the patient, whether sane or insane, age, sex, civil condition, \r\nbirthplace, residence, occupation, how committed, committed from, date of \r\ncommission, how supported (by state, town, or private), date of discharge, how \r\nremoved, and remarks. For example:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Warren Edward Whitehill, sane, 16, male, single, born New Jersey, residence \r\nSpringfield, no occupation, committed by District Court at Salem, 12 August \r\n1898, supported by the town, died 29 May 1905 of pulmonary \r\ntuberculosis<br><br></li>\r\n<li>George Mullin, insane, 13, male, single, born Boston, residence Holyoke, no \r\noccupation, admitted from Northampton Hospital 25 February 1902, supported by \r\nthe town, died 30 October 1905 from exhaustion from epilepsy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>At Rutland, the State Sanatorium kept records from 1898 to 1918, also \r\navailable at the Massachusetts State Archives or through the Family History \r\nLibrary. The detailed patient registers contain the date of admission, name and \r\naddress of patient, sex, age, married or single, religion, occupation, place of \r\nbusiness, dependents, trial, date of discharge, who is paying for the hospital, \r\nfamily physician, friends, place and date of birth, and mother's and father's \r\nnames and places of birth. Other registers in the sanatorium also included \r\nlength of stay and result. </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>On 30 January 1900 Chas. T. Crook of Attleboro was admitted; he was male, \r\n16, single, Protestant, worked in a jewelry shop, dependent was his father, send \r\nbill to father, physician was Dr. A.A. Amsden of Attleboro, friends were his \r\nfather A.W. Crook of Attleboro and his mother S.W. Crook of Plainville; he was \r\ndischarged on 5 May 1900 after a stay of 96 days but was not improved, in fact \r\nworse. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>On 1 May 1905 Frederick E. Marsh of 380 Court St., Ware was admitted; he was \r\nmale, 48, married, Protestant, a self-employed silver plater, had a wife and 4 \r\nchildren as dependants; he was discharged 31 August 1905; he was paying for his \r\nstay himself; his physician was Dr. Pearson of Ware; his friends were his wife \r\nMrs. Frederick Marsh Mr. E.N. Lyman of Ware; he was born at Ware on 18 September \r\n1856 to Wm. C. Marsh born Hardwick and Delia B. [Comsear?] born Ware.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are three institutions in Boston for which records are available: the \r\nBoston Insane Hospital or Lunatic Hospital (records available from 1855 to 1907 \r\nat MSA or through FHL);the Hospital at Rainsford Island (1854-1866); and the \r\nMassachusetts School for Idiotic and Feeble-minded Youth (1864-1909). All \r\nrecords can be accessed at MSA or through the FHL. The registers of the Boston \r\nInsane Hospital contain the name of the patient, age, sex, civil condition, \r\nbirthplace, residence, committed by, committed from, committed on, discharged \r\non, removed by, and remarks. For example: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Wm. E. Foley, age 30, male, born Boston, residence Boston, committed on 7 \r\nJan. 1880, discharged on 23 Feb. 1911, removed by the Board of Insanity to \r\nMedfield Hospital </li>\r\n<li>Maria F. Dennis, age 69, female, widow, born New Hampshire, residence \r\nBoston, admitted by probate court 7 Dec. 1903, died 3 Jan. 1904 from exhaustion \r\nof Melancholia</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The registers of the Hospital at Rainsford Island contain the name of the \r\npatient, age, birthplace, marital status, occupation, previous health, habits, \r\ncolor, date of admission, disease, duration before admission, condition, result, \r\ndeparture, and remarks. Many of the patients were recent immigrants, as in the \r\nfollowing examples:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>John Kerrigan, age 22, born Ireland, married, tailor, poor health, irregular \r\nhabits, admitted 19 August 1854, Phthises for 1 year, very feeble, not improved, \r\ndeparted 13 October 1854, sent to Ireland </li>\r\n<li>Mary Manning, age 24, born Ireland, married, housewife, good health, \r\nadmitted 3 April 1855, Parturition for 4 hours, favorable condition, had child 4 \r\nApril 1855</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The hospital also took in Civil War soldiers: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Sergt. Wm. Griffen, late of Co. I, 2nd N.H. Vols., Fever and Ague, married \r\nto Abigail Brown at R.I. Hospital </li>\r\n<li>Wm. Parker late of Co. L., 1st Ky. Arty., Loss of Leg, Died August 8th \r\n1865.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Finally, registers were kept by the Massachusetts Commission on Mental \r\nDiseases of patients in private hospitals from 1843 to 1917. In the register \r\nthat covers from 1884 to 1914 there are listed forty-two private asylums or \r\ndoctors licensed to take mental patients. Information contained includes the \r\nname of the patient, age, sex, civil condition, birthplace, residence, committed \r\nby, committed from, committed on, discharged on, removed by, and remarks.

(I did not win their award for &#8220;most interesting \r\npaper.&#8221;)&#160; However, Mary Williams has always been something of a family \r\nlegend - a ghost treated by my older relatives with great affection - \r\nand even at an early age I began to collect what information I could \r\nfind about her.&#160; Mary Williams was born to a well-to-do family in \r\nCurrituck and was married at 15 to an adventurer who took her money and \r\nwent to New Orleans where he died of cholera.&#160; Thereafter she moved with\r\n some of her second cousins to Hinds Co., Mississippi, and by the \r\noutbreak of the Civil War to Haywood Co. Tennessee, where she died in \r\n1906.</p>\r\n <p>Being only 13 or 14 at the time, I was quite limited in the\r\n research I might do.&#160; No one knew anything of Mary&#8217;s parents, and even \r\nless about her forebears.&#160; Only much later, as an adult (after years of \r\nbeleaguering some very patient clerks with long-distance request for \r\ndeeds and wills) did I discover her to be the great--granddaughter of \r\nThomas Sawyer of Pasquotank, who died in 1765, and his wife Margaret , \r\nabout whom nothing seemed to be known after the probate of her husband&#8217;s\r\n will [2].&#160; Thomas was a sea captain, as were his father Caleb and \r\ngrandfather Thomas; his will includes the bequest of several ships to \r\nhis sons.&#160; I did not realize how extensive his travels were, or how \r\ntypical it would be for coastal Southerners to have connections in the \r\nNorth or abroad, until I came upon the microfilm (&#8220;Extracts from the \r\nCotton Manuscripts&#8221;) mentioned above.&#160; Subsequent visits to the \r\nMassachusetts Historical Society, the Plymouth [Mass.] Historical \r\nSociety, and the Savannah Historical Society have failed to uncover \r\nanything faintly resembling the full &#8220;Cotton Manuscripts.&#8221;&#160; It would be \r\ninteresting to know the whereabouts of the full compilation.</p>\r\n <p>Margaret\r\n (Cotton) Sawyer, b. Plymouth, Mass. 23 January 1730, was the daughter \r\nof Rev. Josiah Cotton (1680-1756), Register of Deeds for Plymouth Colony\r\n [3], and his wife Hannah Sturtevant (1687-1756), the daughter of John \r\nSturtevant (b. 1658) and his wife Hannah (Winslow) Crowe (1644-1684).&#160; \r\nMargaret marred Thomas Sawyer at Plymouth 14 September 1749.&#160; One can \r\nonly imagine what kind of nerve it took for a minister&#8217;s daughter to \r\ntake up with a Southern sea-trader, leave what she probably considered \r\nto be &#8220;civilization,&#8221; and embark upon a journey to a part of the world \r\nthat for most New Englanders only dimly existed. In his will [5] Rev. \r\nCotton added a codicil, date 14 March 1750, which touchingly bespeaks \r\nthe distance that Margaret would put between herself and her family.</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;Inasmuch as my Daughter Margarett is gon to No. Carolina, where I \r\nsuppose she may be well Provided for as to Temporall Enjoyments, I do \r\nupon a full consideration of that affair from first to last, utterly \r\nretract, Revoke and Disanull That part of my aforewritten Will wherein I\r\n have made her an Equall Legatee with her Sisters and do allow her what \r\nshe had had; and if She come again to thi[s] Country a Living or \r\ndwelling in my House if she see cause, and Twenty shillings in money and\r\n her part of the Books in full of what She is to receive of my Estate; \r\nand my said will in every thing else to stand good....Only if she hath \r\nany Children at my decease I give to them (or it) Sixty pounds Old \r\nTenour.&#8221;</p>\r\n <p>It is difficult to say whether the old minister approved\r\n of this union, but connections between the families were scrupulously \r\nmaintained until at least the third generation, judging from the \r\nmanuscript extracts that I have seen.&#160; A deed written two years later by\r\n Josiah [<strong>25</strong>] Cotton and his wife in order to distribute the \r\nproperty of John Sturtevant mentions Margaret Sawyer as a full legatee \r\n[5].</p>\r\n <p>Hannah (Sturtevant) Cotton&#8217;s grandfather Josiah Winslow, \r\nbrother of Edward Winslow the <em>Mayflower </em>passenger, provides the\r\n necessary link for an &#8220;almost-<em>Mayflower</em> &#8221; connection.&#160; Below \r\nis a chart of the Plymouth descent of Mary G.

You do not need to worry about knowing \r\nall of these abbreviations, the State Historian will formalize them on your \r\nfinal application, but it helps to know some of the more commonly used ones:<br><ul>\r\n<li>B/C, M/C, D/C = Birth certificate, marriage certificate, death certificate \r\nrefers to a certificate issued by town, county, or state authority with \r\ninformation taken from an original record. You do not need to write the volume, \r\npage, issuing authority, or any other information. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>B/R, M/R, D/R = Birth record, marriage record, death record. A \"record\" is \r\nan image of the actual original record as it appears in the town, county, or \r\nstate repository, often taken from microfilm of the original volumes. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>MF = Mayflower Families Through Five Generations; MFIP = Mayflower Families \r\nin Progress; MQ = The Mayflower Quarterly; MD = The Mayflower Descendant. You do \r\nnot need to send copies of pages from any of these volumes. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>VR = the published vital records of the town where the event took place. \r\nInclude the volume and page of the book. If the record is from the published \r\nvital records of Massachusetts or Connecticut, you do not need to send copies of \r\npages. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>NEHGR = New England Historic Genealogical Register; TAG = The American \r\nGenealogist; NGSQ = National Genealogical Society Quarterly; NYGBR = New York \r\nGenealogical and Biographical Record. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>1850 FC NY = 1850 Federal census, New York State. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nWhenever a \r\nrecord is for the spouse of the line carrier add the prefix \"s\" (e.g., s-B/C; \r\ns-obit). In the reference column, list the primary documents first, then the \r\nsecondary sources.<br><br>You will need to supply two photocopies of every \r\nsource document that you submit with your paper (one stays with the State \r\nSociety and one goes to the General Society files). As noted above, you do not \r\nneed to send photocopies of published vital records of Massachusetts and \r\nConnecticut, or of any of the Mayflower Society's publications (in addition, the \r\nGeneral Society library has many standard genealogies and books - check with \r\nyour State Historian if you have questions about whether or not you need to \r\nsupply copies from any particular book). If two or more members of your family \r\nare joining at the same time, you do not need to supply duplicate sets of \r\ndocuments for each person.<br><br>To help expedite your application, highlight \r\nthe pertinent information on each document with a yellow highlight pen - names, \r\ndates, places. Also, you can code the documents by writing the generation number \r\nfollowed by a code letter (as listed below) in red ink on the upper right-hand \r\ncorner of each document. These little things will shorten the time the State \r\nHistorian spends on your application as well as help you to organize your \r\nrecords:<br><br>a = birth of line carrier<br>b = death of line carrier<br>c = \r\nmarriage<br>d = birth of spouse<br>e = death of spouse<br><br>For example, the \r\nbirth certificate of line carrier Mary Adams in the seventh generation would be \r\ncoded \"7a\" while her husband's birth certificate would be \"7d\" and so \r\nforth.<br><br>Finally, your documents should be arranged in order by generation, \r\nnewest generation first. Thus your own birth and (if appropriate) marriage, and \r\nspouse birth certificates first; your parents' records next, grandparents next, \r\nproceeding backward. Within the generations, arrange the records in a, b, c, d, \r\ne, order as much as possible - obviously, some records and secondary sources may \r\nrefer to more than one generation. Do NOT submit multiple copies of the same \r\nsource for different generations.<br><br><strong>Red Flags</strong><br><br>When \r\nthe historians review your application (at both the state and General Society \r\nlevels), they will be looking for \"red flags\" that indicate possible problems \r\nwith the lineage. An awareness of these flags may help you avoid \r\nproblems.<br><br><u>Blank spaces</u>: Even though there are times when you don't \r\nknow the specific place or date of an event, try to fill in the space with \r\nsomething [always place brackets around estimated information]. For example, a \r\nplace of birth can be estimated from the location of the family in a census; a \r\nbirth date can be estimated from the age in a census or age at death; a death \r\ncan be designated as \"after\" a date of a deed or \"bet\" the date of signing a \r\nwill and when the will was probated; or a marriage date can be estimated from \r\nthe birth of the first child.<br><br><u>Single secondary source</u>: Citing only \r\none secondary source for a whole generation or more is inadequate. Try to locate \r\nat least one or two primary records for the generation, but if you cannot locate \r\nprimary records, at least collect as many census records for the individual as \r\npossible that will support the secondary source as to their residence, age, and \r\nrelationships to other members of the family. <br><br><u>Name's the same</u>: \r\nJust because the census record says your John Crane was born in Massachusetts \r\nabout 1800, does not necessarily mean he is the same John Crane whose birth is \r\nrecorded in Norton. Likewise, because Benjamin Jones married a girl named Mary \r\nSmith in Dartmouth does not necessarily mean that she is the same Mary Smith \r\nwhose birth is recorded in Dartmouth. Examples of unrecorded children abound, \r\nand people with similar names can easily be confused. <br><br><u>Missing maiden \r\nnames</u>: Often a birth, marriage, or death record for an individual may not \r\ninclude the maiden name of the mother of that individual. The record may simply \r\nstate that the parents of Susan Allen are James and Elizabeth Allen. You may \r\nhave a marriage record for James Allen and Elizabeth Green, but this does not \r\nprove they are the parents of Susan Allen -- or James Allen may have had two \r\nwives named Elizabeth (it happens!). If the Mayflower line descends through \r\nElizabeth Green, then the lineage would not descend through children of James' \r\nother wife.<br><br><u>Geographic leaps</u>: If Mary Jones was born in Hingham, \r\nMassachusetts, and her parents lived and died in there, can she really be the \r\nsame Mary Jones who was married in Groton, Connecticut? Although there are \r\nexceptions to everything, marriages usually took place in the town of residence \r\nof the bride's family. Any big geographic change needs to be corroborated with \r\nprimary evidence. Is the Daniel Brown family of Iowa in 1850 the same Daniel \r\nBrown family of Maine in 1840?<br><br><u>Age discrepancies</u>: On average the \r\nusual marriage age for women was 18-20 and for men about 25-30. The usual child \r\nbearing years for a woman are from her late teens to her mid 40's. Again, while \r\nthere are exceptions to everything, any extreme deviation from these averages \r\nmay put up a red flag - such as a woman marrying at the age of 13 or having a \r\nchild past age 50. Technically possible, these are not usual circumstances and \r\nwould need to be supported by very solid primary \r\ndocumentation.<br><br><u>Records from other generations</u>: Although the names \r\nof parents appear on a child's birth certificate, that record is not proof of \r\nthe parents' marriage. The name of an informant on a death certificate is not \r\nproof that person is a child of the deceased.<br><br><u>Multiple marriages</u>: \r\nIf either a line carrier or spouse has multiple marriages, the names of other \r\nspouses should be noted beside their names [e.g. \"m 2) John Smith\"] and \r\ndocumentation for the other marriages should be submitted. If the applicant has \r\nbeen married more than once, list each marriage in order and supply all marriage \r\nand (if appropriate) divorce records as well as birth and death records as \r\nappropriate for all spouses.

One of the achievements of David Lindsay&#8217;s<em>Mayflower Bastard</em></p>\r\nis the author&#8217;s ability to make his discovery of his ancestor also a pilgrimage \r\nof his own self-discovery.<div class=\"page\"><p>The book&#8217;s title is Lindsay&#8217;s compass &#8211; his lodestar for \r\nnavigating the tale of his<em> Mayflower</em> ancestor Richard More. The story \r\nthat was already known was that Richard, along with his brother and two sisters, \r\nwas shipped off with the <em>Mayflower </em>Separatists by Lord Samuel More, who \r\nhad repudiated and disinherited the four young children born during his stormy \r\nmarriage to his cousin Lady Katherine More. However, Lindsay&#8217;s title signifies \r\nhis certainty that Richard was the child of Katharine More by the estate&#8217;s \r\nyeoman, Jacob Blakeway (from whom Lindsay came to think he was descended) and \r\nnot by her lawful husband, Lord Samuel More. <br><br>&#160;While Lindsay&#8217;s conclusion \r\nis a possibility &#8211; given the highly charged and ambiguous relationship of \r\nKatherine to both Samuel and Jacob &#8211; Richard&#8217;s actual paternity remains \r\nunproven, and at best uncertain.&#160; My own interpretation of the existing data and \r\nthe English law of the time does not really support Lindsay&#8217;s conclusion that \r\nRichard should be considered illegitimate, let alone labeled a bastard \r\n[1].&#160;However, as befitting the descendant of the <em>Mayflower</em> voyager who \r\nlater became&#160;\"Old Captain More,\" the salty vigor of \"bastard\" helped Lindsay \r\nweave the sailor&#8217;s yarns he favors, spinning them out of considerable research \r\nand spicing them with his predilection for inventiveness. [2] In a previous book \r\n[3], Lindsay characterized Alexander Graham Bell as balancing \"sense and \r\nsensationalism\" &#8211; which fits here.&#160;Neither was a bad hand at \r\ndiscovery.<br><br>Although Lindsay launched Richard in rough waters, he was \r\nsteadier in relating Richard&#8217;s passage into adulthood and old age.&#160;He grants \r\nRichard the man the dignity he deserves, even with his documented misdeeds of \r\nbusiness and weaknesses of flesh.&#160;Lindsay takes pains to show that Richard often \r\ndid the best he could with what life handed to him.&#160;We learn that he was not \r\nwithout decency and kindness, and he displayed a sense of responsibility to his \r\nfamily and friends. Richard More was an individualist but not a Separatist, and \r\ndespite a young childhood spent in Elder William Brewster&#8217;s household, he was \r\nnot one of the Saints. Richard&#8217;s survival-driven business practices in a \r\nhardscrabble life were often dubious, and evidence also suggests that he \r\ncommitted bigamy as a young man and adultery as an aging one. Lindsay here \r\nreminds us how serious and scary sexual misconduct was in those times.&#160;It \r\ncertainly went on, but the punishing hand of the law could be very severe.&#160;In an \r\nodd turn, it seems easier for Lindsay to think of Richard as a bastard then it \r\nwas for him to believe him actually guilty of adultery, which is more than \r\nlikely.&#160;The court&#8217;s charges (which Lindsay conjectures may have been fabricated) \r\nwere also made by his church, which excommunicated him (they reinstated him two \r\nyears later).&#160;However, if biography \"aims not merely at informing but also at \r\nmoving the reader through the spectacle of another soul&#8217;s journey through \r\nexistence,\" [4] then David Lindsay has done well by Richard. <br><br>He also \r\ndoes very well in his reading of the feisty Lady Katherine and the self-serving \r\nLord Samuel More. He captures the character of each and his psychological takes \r\nseem right on the mark.&#160;With all due respect to Lord Samuel&#8217;s descendants, \r\nLindsay&#8217;s sober account of the harm done by the power-abusing Lord Samuel to his \r\nfirst wife and the children (and in his later role as a deserter of his \r\nsoldiers) makes it understandable why Lindsay came to prefer to think of himself \r\nas descended from a pleasure-seeking, working-class man like Jacob Blakeway.&#160;&#160; \r\n<br><br>The biography describes Richard being witness to the Witch Trials of his \r\nhometown of Salem, where he kept an \"ordinary\" after his sea days were \r\nover.&#160;Lindsay relates many historical events that occurred in the places that \r\nRichard lived, as well as the areas he traveled to as a mariner.&#160;Sometimes the \r\ndata seem like oddments, but they often bring a fuller understanding of the \r\nbackground that affected Richard&#8217;s life.<br><br>It would be tempting for a lover \r\nof great literature to fault Lindsay on his narrative style or his ability to \r\nevoke an always perfectly true picture of Richard in his sketches.&#160;Ironically, \r\nonly figures that come out of a writer&#8217;s deep and pure imagination can evoke an \r\nindelible truth for the reader.&#160;We all know who the lovesick Juliet is.&#160;We \r\nhardly know who the probably heartsick Dorothy (May) Bradford was. In this book \r\nof Lindsay&#8217;s seafaring ancestor, the author is not Melville but Captain More is \r\nalso not Captain Ahab. Ahab, as pure fiction, could be single-mindedly portrayed \r\nas driven by the evil of revenge.&#160; Richard More&#8217;s portrait is complicated by the \r\nnecessity of uncovering facts and analyzing them with judicious \r\nrestraint.&#160;Despite the imperfections of style, and possibly of interpretation, \r\nLindsay did create something of value. I&#8217;m glad that Lindsay thought there was a \r\nhot story to be told because, like Columbus, he may not have been exactly where \r\nhe thought he was, but he discovered America anyway! Without Lindsay&#8217;s \r\nidentification with his subject an important journey might not have been made, \r\nand a good tale might not have been told.<br><br>Notes<br><br>1.&#160; \"Hostages of&#160; \r\nFortune/The More Children of the <em>Mayflower\".&#160; </em>R.G.

At that time, the original Plymouth settlement was populated by \r\napproximately one hundred and sixty colonists who had arrived on the <em>Mayflower</em>\r\n (1620), the <em>Fortune</em> (1621), the <em>Anne</em> (1623), and the <em>Little\r\n James</em> (1623). In the Plantation&#8217;s re-created village all the major \r\nfacets of Pilgrim life are represented, albeit on a smaller scale. A \r\ndozen timber-framed houses line the main street, an acre of corn is \r\nunder cultivation, and rare breeds of livestock inhabit the pens. The \r\nvillage bustles with activity as colonial interpreters go about the \r\nbusiness of everyday life in 1627. </p>\r\n <p>Visitors to Plimoth \r\nPlantation &#8212; between three and four hundred thousand each year &#8212; are \r\nundoubtedly captivated by their &#8220;time travel&#8221; experience. The sights, \r\nsounds, and smells provide twenty-first-century visitors with a bridge \r\nto early seventeenth-century life. Interactions with colonial \r\ninterpreters offer meaningful insights into the actions and motivations \r\nof the original colonists. Visitors depart with a renewed sense of \r\nhistory and an appreciation for the work undertaken by the Plimoth \r\nPlantation staff. Re-creation and interpretation in the Plimoth village \r\nrequires examining the often-scanty historical evidence, and literally \r\nbringing it to life.</p>\r\n <p>Plimoth Plantation staff historian Carolyn \r\nTravers offers her perspective &#8212; gained during thirty-one years of \r\nemployment at the Plantation &#8212; on how early Plymouth research is \r\nintegrated into a living history experience. According to Travers, \r\nPlantation staff members use the resources of established organizations \r\nlike the New England Historic Genealogical Society and the General \r\nSociety of Mayflower Descendants. They draw on the large body of work \r\npublished about early Plymouth colonists, particularly those who came on\r\n the <em>Mayflower</em>. The following are the most frequently consulted:</p>\r\n<p>&#8226; <em>The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers Who Came \r\nto Plymouth on the </em>Mayflower<em> in 1620, the </em>Fortune<em> in 1621,\r\n and the </em>Anne<em> and the </em>Little James<em> in 1623</em> by Charles \r\nEdward Banks </p>\r\n <p>&#8226; <em>The Great Migration Begins: Immigrants to New \r\nEngland, 1620&#8211;1633</em> and <em>The Great Migration: Immigrants to New \r\nEngland, 1634&#8211;1635</em> by Robert Charles Anderson</p>\r\n <p>&#8226; The \r\n&#8220;Mayflower Families Through Five Generations&#8221; project of the General \r\nSociety of Mayflower Descendants</p>\r\n <p>&#8226; <em>Plymouth Colony: Its \r\nHistory and People 1620&#8211;1691</em> by Eugene Aubrey Stratton</p>\r\n <p>&#8226; \r\nArticles in <em>The American Genealogist</em>, <em>The Genealogist</em>, <em>The\r\n New England Historical and Genealogical Register</em>, and other \r\ngenealogical journals.</p>\r\n <p>In addition, Plimoth Plantation staff \r\nmembers examine a variety of other historical sources. Knowledge of a \r\ncolonist&#8217;s background is necessary to interpret how he or she would have\r\n reacted to conditions in Plymouth. The following questions are asked, \r\n&#8220;What was this person&#8217;s way of life prior to leaving for New England?&#8221; \r\nand &#8220;How would people have reacted to New England conditions based on \r\ntheir previous ways of life?&#8221;</p>\r\n <p>In 1984, Plimoth Plantation \r\nsponsored several major research trips designed to answer these \r\nquestions. Researchers went to Leiden and the North and South of England\r\n to explore all aspects of the places where the early Plymouth colonists\r\n were believed to have originated. Staff members spoke with local \r\nexperts about a variety of topics, including architecture, the \r\nlandscape, regional dialects, the experience of childhood, crops and \r\ndiet, people of note, and local happenings. The goal was to amass a \r\nwealth of detail about the colonists&#8217; experiences of everyday life in \r\nEngland or Leiden, which in turn would be used to create a realistic \r\nportrayal of everyday life in Plymouth. </p>\r\n <p>When a colonist&#8217;s \r\norigins are unknown, though, a background must be created. Obviously, it\r\n would not be a rewarding interaction if a colonial interpreter told a \r\nvisitor that he didn&#8217;t know where he was from and didn&#8217;t know the names \r\nof his parents. In these cases, historian Carolyn Travers makes a series\r\n of educated guesses to construct a realistic background. Take the case \r\nof Stephen Deane, who arrived on the <em>Fortune</em> in 1621. His surname\r\n &#8212; Deane &#8212; is difficult to research. It is not unusual and it is not \r\narea-specific. The typical background provided in such situations is \r\nLondon or Southwark because those areas were highly populated, and many \r\npeople passed through them. Birth and marriage dates often must be \r\nestimated, based on when the first child was born, when a spouse arrived\r\n in the colony, or when men, on average, first married. If a colonist&#8217;s \r\nparents&#8217; names are unknown, names must be chosen for them. In order to \r\nselect believable names, Travers follows the convention of naming \r\nchildren after parents or grandparents. Stephen Deane&#8217;s father, then, \r\nmight also be given the name Stephen, and his mother might be given the \r\nname of one of Stephen&#8217;s daughters: Elizabeth, Miriam, or Susanna. Or a \r\nparent might be given one of the common names of the time: Mary, Ann, or\r\n Elizabeth for a woman and William, Thomas, Edward, Robert, or John for a\r\n man. Staff interpreters receive biographies about their characters and \r\nthe manufactured details are marked accordingly. In the end, all the \r\n&#8220;statistically likely&#8221; information contributes to developing and \r\nrounding out the personalities of the colonists. </p>\r\n <p>In addition to \r\ncharacter profiles, the interpreters use other sources to prepare for \r\ntheir roles, including four Plimoth Plantation training manuals, William\r\n Bradford&#8217;s history, <em>Of Plymouth Plantation</em>, Bradford and Edward \r\nWinslow&#8217;s work, <em>Mourt&#8217;s Relation: A Journal of the Pilgrims at \r\nPlymouth</em>, and <em>Three Visitors to Early Plymouth: Letters About the\r\n Pilgrim Settlement in New England During Its First Seven Years</em>. \r\nMany interpreters undertake further research into their characters&#8217; \r\norigins, dialects, and occupations. Staff members prepare for their \r\nroles during two weeks of lectures and workshops on topics ranging from \r\nhistory to cooking safety to learning styles to emergency procedures. \r\nDuring the training period, new interpreters are paired with experienced\r\n interpreters. Also, those cast as members of a family interact and \r\nconstruct the stories they will relate to visitors. For instance, \r\nalthough there is no record of how married couples met, husbands and \r\nwives need to have an agreed-upon answer for that question. Ultimately, \r\nstaff interpreters need to possess a solid historical background as well\r\n as both people and period skills. </p>\r\n <p>Because Plimoth Village is \r\nself-guided and the characters do not give set speeches, visitor \r\ninterests and questions are of primary importance. Consequently, the \r\nexperience is much more visitor-driven than at most museums, and \r\ninterpreters never know where the next question might lead. Commonly, \r\nvisitors begin conversations by asking about the tasks in which \r\ncharacters are engaged. They might ask about the period tools or objects\r\n being used. And they may ask when the colonist arrived in Plymouth, how\r\n Native peoples are viewed, and what relations are like with the next \r\ndoor neighbors. People often discuss their own personal interests with \r\nthe interpreters, whether it be cooking, fishing, or religious beliefs. \r\nVisitors tend to gravitate toward characters whose life situations are \r\nsimilar to their own; mothers with small children are likely to speak to\r\n the mothers with small children in the village and kids look for child \r\ninterpreters.</p>\r\n <p>Since so many people are descended from early \r\nPlymouth colonists, interpreters are often asked genealogical questions.\r\n Visitors should be aware that the family history information provided \r\nby interpreters might not necessarily be true; as described earlier, \r\nwhen key information is unknown, it is often created. Obviously, then, \r\ngenealogists wouldn&#8217;t want to add this &#8220;new&#8221; information into their \r\nfamily trees. On the other hand, the staff at Plimoth Plantation tries \r\nto keep abreast of all the latest scholarship and when a discovery is \r\nmade, it will be added to the character portrayal. For instance, when a \r\n2003 article in <em>The American Genealogist </em>revealed that Richard \r\nWarren&#8217;s wife Elizabeth was the daughter of Augustine Walker, that \r\ninformation was incorporated immediately. Genealogists must understand \r\nthat since it is 1627 the characters cannot acknowledge their \r\ndescendants as such. Many visitors will greet characters by introducing \r\nthemselves as descendants. In those cases, the interpreter will simply \r\nrecognize that the person is family and steer the conversation into more\r\n fruitful channels.</p>\r\n <p>Interpreters at Plimoth Plantation converse \r\nwith visitors and also demonstrate the tasks of everyday life in the \r\nearly seventeenth century. The chores can be quite taxing and often \r\nphysically demanding. Interpreters in the village cook both inside and \r\noutside; bake; clean; sew; garden; build fences; repair roofs; build and\r\n rebuild; care for cows, goats, chickens, and sheep; tend cornfields; \r\nclean and salt fish; and undertake a variety of other chores. The \r\ninterpreters use period-appropriate hand tools, and perform all their \r\ntasks in the attire of the time, which means the interpreters generally \r\nwear wool, linen, and leather clothing. Interpreters can be challenged \r\nfurther by the weather, which might be hot, cold, windy, or wet, or by \r\nthe natural lighting, which especially in the fall can be insufficient. \r\nClearly, being an interpreter is a special calling!</p>\r\n <p>Plimoth \r\nPlantation employs between forty and forty-five full-time colonial \r\ninterpreters; approximately fourteen are on duty in the village at any \r\ngiven time. In addition, a few child volunteers, generally the children \r\nof staff members, portray some of the younger members of the colony \r\nduring the summer. The interpreters are drawn from a surprisingly large \r\ngeographic area; some commute from quite a distance, even from as far as\r\n Connecticut and New Hampshire. They hail from a wide variety of \r\nbackgrounds, with many having previously worked in education, theatre, \r\nand history. Those who enjoy the work tend to stay, and many return year\r\n after year &#8212; one interpreter has been with Plimoth Plantation since \r\n1979. Although first-year interpreters are assigned roles, over time \r\npeople can request specific roles or general categories (i.e. a married \r\nwoman who arrived on the <em>Mayflower</em>, for instance). Needless to \r\nsay, the interpreter must be an appropriate match: a young interpreter \r\nis not cast to play a character that would have been old in 1627 and \r\nvice versa. Many interpreters find it interesting to portray different \r\ncharacters over time; for example, they receive different perspectives \r\nwhen they play <em>Mayflower</em> passengers and when they play colonists \r\nwho came on the later ships.</p>\r\n <p>The physical details of Plymouth \r\nColony are subject to the same intense study and scrutiny as the \r\ncharacters. Houses in the village are built according to the \r\npeculiarities of construction in Plymouth in its first years. The \r\noriginal houses were built primarily by people who were not skilled \r\ncarpenters but were directed by several experienced craftsmen. Over \r\ntime, as scholarship about building construction methods progresses, new\r\n information is incorporated into the next version of a house. And, yes,\r\n the houses do need to be replaced periodically. They must appear \r\nrealistic for 1627; if a house was allowed to stand for decades it would\r\n look too old for a building of less than six years. Similarly, a \r\ntwenty-year-old rosebush had to be uprooted because a rosebush of that \r\nage simply couldn&#8217;t have existed in Plymouth in 1627.</p>\r\n <p>For people \r\nable to make the trip, a visit to Plimoth Plantation offers an \r\nextraordinary journey to the past, facilitated by skilled interpreters. \r\nThe interpretive lessons taught by Plimoth Plantation, though, can be \r\nextrapolated by genealogists, no matter where they live. The goal of \r\nPlimoth Plantation&#8217;s Pilgrim Village is to immerse visitors in the world\r\n of 1627 Plymouth and help them understand all aspects of the lives of \r\nits early residents. How often do genealogists research their ancestors \r\nto place them in a similar context? Do you know what dialect your \r\nancestors spoke? What tasks made up their workdays? What differences \r\nexisted between the places they emigrated from and to? It might be \r\ninstructive to select an ancestor, and, as an exercise, immerse yourself\r\n in his or her world. You might be surprised at how much there is yet to\r\n learn about your forebears and, like the twenty-year-old rosebush at \r\nPlimoth Plantation, about the many anachronistic ideas about them need \r\nto be discarded.</p>\r\n <p><strong>Lynn Betlock</strong><em> is editorial manager of </em>New\r\n England Ancestors<em>.</em></p>\r\n <p><em><br></em><strong>Coming Soon!</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>The Pilgrim Migration: Immigrants to Plymouth Colony, \r\n1620&#8211;1633</em> by Robert Charles Anderson</strong></p>\r\n <p>This new hardcover \r\nvolume, to be published by the end of 2004, will feature 215 \r\nbiographical sketches on immigrants to Plymouth who arrived between 1620\r\n and 1633.

An individual with more than one <em>Mayflower</em> head of family may file supplemental lineages after the initial application is completed.</p>\r\n<p>Individuals join one of the fifty-two &#8220;state&#8221; societies (including the District of Columbia and the Dominion of Canada) that make up the General Society. Each sets its own fees and dues, so cost of membership will vary. You may join any state society regardless of residence, although for obvious reasons joining the state where you live provides more opportunities to participate in activities. You may also have dual memberships in two or more state societies, and annual memberships may be transferred to another state (life memberships cannot be transferred). Contact information for each state society is available on the website.</p>\r\n<p>Each state society also has its own schedule of events. The Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, for example, holds three state-wide events each year: an annual meeting in the spring, a &#8220;Peregrination to Plymouth&#8221; in June, and a &#8220;Compact Day&#8221; meeting in the fall. Most societies hold Compact Day meetings to celebrate the signing of the famous &#8220;Mayflower Compact&#8221; (the contract that established how the new colony would be governed, necessitated by their having landed outside the bounds of their legal grant). Some state societies have scholarship programs for their members, such as the Massachusetts society, which also annually awards a scholarship to descendants of the Wampanoag tribe. Societies also publish newsletters for their membership, distribute educational material to schools, and have other projects. The Massachusetts Society publishes the scholarly genealogical magazine <em>The Mayflower Descendant</em>, and the New York Society holds an annual debutante ball for the benefit of their educational programs.</p>\r\n<p>All members receive <em>The Mayflower Quarterly,</em> the publication of the General Society of Mayflower Descendants, which includes news about the national organization, state societies, photographs, and historical and genealogical articles.</p>\r\n<p>The General Society also researches and publishes the series <em>Mayflower Families Through Five Generations</em> and <em>Mayflower Families in Progress</em>, as well as various other books, including the vital records of Dennis and Raynham, Massachusetts (see the website under &#8220;Books, Insignia, and Educational Materials&#8221; for details on the available books). The <em>Mayflower Families</em> project has been ongoing for more than forty years with the goal of thoroughly researching and documenting the first five generations of descendants of all <em>Mayflower</em> passengers. . New editions of all of these volumes are published as needed to reflect updated research, so it is important to pay attention to the edition when citing these works.</p>\r\n<p>The first step in joining the Mayflower Society is to contact the state and request a Preliminary Application. You will receive information about the membership categories, requirements, application fees, and dues of that state organization. In Massachusetts, Annual and Life memberships are open to descendants who are eighteen years of age or older and Minor Life memberships are for all descendants under age eighteen. Some state societies have Junior memberships for children.</p>\r\n<p>The preliminary package will also include a &#8220;synopsis&#8221; form with instructions to fill in the names in your direct line of descent from the <em>Mayflower</em> passenger you wish to join under (no details or documentation are required at this point). The State Historian will use the synopsis to determine how much of your line has previously been filed and documented by the Society. A printable synopsis is available on the website under &#8220;Proposed Application Review Form.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>When your Preliminary Application, synopsis, and payment for the type of membership you want are received, the State Historian will send a worksheet lineage paper and instruction sheets. The worksheet will be filled in with the information that has already been documented and the instructions will tell you how to complete the rest of the paper and what documents are acceptable as proof for the line. </p>\r\n<p>The lineage paper has three columns: place, date, reference. For each generation, the place and date of birth, marriage, and death must be filled in (if known) for both the line carrier and the spouse, and citations to documentation supporting each event must be listed in the reference column on the same line as the event.</p>\r\n<p>Primary documentation &#8211; birth, marriage, death certificates, Bibles, wills, deeds, census, etc. (records that were made at the time of the event or by a reliable witness to the event) &#8211; is preferred whenever possible. Secondary documentation &#8211; published genealogies, histories, transcriptions, etc. &#8211; may be used (with some restrictions). Published genealogies that cite the sources for their information are preferred over those that give no sources. Unpublished typescripts and manuscripts are <em>not</em> acceptable (although, if they contain unique information relevant to the line, they may be submitted for informational use). The last three generations on each lineage paper <em>must</em> be fully documented with birth, marriage, and (as appropriate) death records for the line carrier (the applicant, applicant&#8217;s parents, and applicant&#8217;s grandparents). For the earlier generations, the rule of thumb is &#8220;the more primary documentation the better.&#8221; References to the Mayflower books noted above may be used for the first five generations on each lineage paper descending from a passenger who has been published (at this writing, all of the passengers, except John Howland, have been covered in one or the other of these series).When you have filled in your worksheet and collected your documents, you will send the worksheet and the copies of documents to the State Historian for review. If you are asked to send original documents in addition to copies, the originals will be returned to you after they have been examined. The State Historian will contact you if there are questions or if more documentation is needed.</p>\r\n<p>When the State Historian is satisfied that your worksheet and documentation are complete, it will be time to prepare final lineage papers. Some states will do this for you; other states will send the forms for you to type. After your signed papers are received, the State Historian will sign and forward the papers and documents to the Historian General&#8217;s office in Plymouth, Massachusetts, where everything will be reviewed again by the Historian General and assistants. Should there be further questions, the Historian General will contact the State Historian, who will pass the questions on to you &#8211; all correspondence is channeled through the state; applicants do not contact the Historian General directly.</p>\r\n<p>If the Historian General is satisfied the line is confirmed, the paper will be approved and returned to the state and you will be elected to membership. Both a State Society number and a General Society number are assigned to the paper, and finally, a photocopy of the signed and approved paper is sent to you for your files. If other members of your family wish to join the Mayflower Society using your file, they should refer to your State and General Society numbers. They will not have to duplicate the documents you have already filed.</p>\r\n<p>Occasionally, a child, grandchild, or near relative of a former member of the Mayflower Society wishes to join, but is told that the lineage papers on file were not properly documented and the new applicant must now provide the missing proof. This unfortunate situation has several causes. First, documentation standards throughout the genealogical world have drastically changed in the last thirty years. Some sources that were accepted a hundred years ago are no longer acceptable. New sources are now available or are more readily accessed. Second, the General Society offices suffered a fire in 1947 that destroyed or damaged many lineage files. Some of these files were replaced from state copies, but much could not be replaced. Finally, the most egregious old practice was <em>not</em> requiring <em>any</em> documentation at all for the last three generations on each lineage paper. Therefore, a lineage filed by a child of the original member would have four undocumented generations; a lineage filed by a grandchild would have five undocumented generations; a lineage filed by a great grandchild would have six, and so forth! By the 1970s there were lineage papers in the Society&#8217;s files that had as many as eight undocumented generations.</p>\r\n<p>Documentation standards today are more stringent and emphasis is placed on primary records or good secondary sources. In future columns we will explore the sources available for Mayflower genealogy and discuss the best practices to assure acceptance of your Mayflower application.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on the history of the ship <em>Mayflower</em> and her passengers, see <a href=\"http://www.mayflowerhistory.com/\" target=\"new\">http://www.mayflowerhistory.com/</a>. </p>\r\n</div>Also see <a title=\"Applying for membership in the Mayflower Society\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/applying-for-membership-in-the-mayflower-society/\">Applying for membership in the Mayflower Society</a>.&#160;</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/the-society-of-mayflower-descendants-pt1/", "published": "", "id": 259}, {"author": "Alicia Crane Williams", "country": "Massachusetts", "title": "Part II: Who Came on the Mayflower: Separating the Facts from the Myths", "content": "<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p class=\"Section1\">If all the people who have been claimed to have come\r\n on the <em>Mayflower</em> to New England in 1620 actually had come on \r\nthat boat, it would have sunk mid-Atlantic. Likewise, all the ink used \r\nto write about the ship and her passengers in the succeeding 385 years \r\ncould have floated her back to England. A great deal of what has been \r\nwritten is mistaken, imaginary, or outright fraudulent. So how do you \r\nknow what is correct?</p>\r\n <p class=\"Section1\">The best place to start is\r\n Caleb Johnson&#8217;s website, <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.mayflowerhistory.com/\">http://www.mayflowerhistory.com/</a>, which contains a list\r\n of all of the <em>Mayflower</em>&#8217;s passengers and what is known about \r\nthem, whether they had descendants, transcriptions of books and \r\ndocuments (many of them written by the Pilgrims) pertaining to both the \r\nship and passengers, and much more. If you don&#8217;t see a person on this \r\nsite, they didn&#8217;t come on the <em>Mayflower</em>.</p>\r\n <p class=\"Section1\">When\r\n the <em>Mayflower</em> left England she had 102 passengers. During the \r\nvoyage, one passenger died (William Butten), and one baby was born \r\n(Oceanus Hopkins); thus, 102 passengers landed in New England (although \r\nit should be noted at least two other pregnant women made the voyage &#8211; \r\nSusanna White who gave birth to Peregrine White, the first European \r\nchild born in New England, shortly after arriving at Cape Cod, and Mary \r\nAllerton who died in February, a few days after giving birth to a \r\nstillborn son). During the first year in Plymouth Colony, half of the \r\npassengers died.</p>\r\n <p class=\"Section1\">Of these 102 passengers, the \r\nMayflower Society recognizes 26 heads of families who have proved \r\ndescendants. For the purposes of membership in the Mayflower Society, \r\nwives and children who also came on the <em>Mayflower</em> are grouped \r\nunder the head of family:</p>\r\n <div class=\"Section1\"> <ul type=\"disc\" style=\"margin-top: 0in;\">\r\n<li><strong>John Alden, </strong>also \r\nrepresenting <em>Mayflower</em> passenger (hereinafter <em>MP</em>) \r\nPriscilla Mullins (daughter of <strong>William Mullins</strong>) whom he later \r\nmarried. John and Priscilla had ten children born in Plymouth and \r\nDuxbury, eight of whom had descendants (Elizabeth, John, Joseph, \r\nJonathan, Ruth, Sarah, Rebecca, and David). </li>\r\n<li><strong>Isaac Allerton,\r\n </strong>representing <em>MP</em>s first wife Mary, son Bartholomew, and \r\ndaughters Remember and Mary. Isaac&#8217;s wife Mary died after giving birth \r\nto a stillborn son in February 1621. He remarried, to Fear Brewster (a \r\ndaughter of <em>MP</em> William Brewster, who was not herself on the <em>Mayflower</em>),\r\n and later had a third wife. Bartholomew returned to England, where he \r\nmarried and had children, although nothing is known about further \r\ndescendants. Daughters Remember and Mary both married and left \r\ndescendants. </li>\r\n<li><strong>John Billington, </strong>representing <em>MP</em>s \r\nwife Elinor and sons John and Francis. All survived; however, the older \r\nJohn Billington, who had a history of troublemaking, became the first \r\nman to be hanged in the colony. Only son Francis left descendants. </li>\r\n<li><strong>William Bradford, </strong>representing <em>MP</em> first wife Dorothy \r\nwho died in December 1620. Their only child, John, left behind in \r\nHolland, came to New England later. He married, but left no children. \r\nWilliam remarried, to widow Alice (Carpenter) Southworth, and had three \r\nmore children (William, Mercy, and Joseph), all of whom left \r\ndescendants. </li>\r\n<li><strong>William Brewster, </strong>representing <em>MP</em>s \r\nwife Mary and sons Love and Wrestling, who all survived. Left behind \r\nwere son Jonathan and daughters Patience and Fear, who came later. All \r\nbut Wrestling left descendants. Fear married <em>MP</em> <strong>Isaac Allerton</strong>\r\n as his second wife. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Peter Brown</strong> came alone, later \r\nmarried twice and had four children, three of whom &#8211; Mary, Priscilla, \r\nand Rebecca &#8211; left descendants. </li>\r\n<li><strong>James Chilton,<em> </em></strong>representing\r\n <em>MP</em>s wife Susanna and daughter Mary. James died in December 1620 \r\nand Susanna in January 1621. James and Susanna had ten children in \r\ntotal, but besides Mary, only their eldest daughter, Isabella (who came \r\nto New England later), survived. Both Isabella and Mary left \r\ndescendants. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Francis Cooke, </strong>representing <em>MP</em> son \r\nJohn. His wife Hester and three other children remained behind and came \r\nto Plymouth on the ship <em>Anne</em> in August 1623. Francis and Hester \r\nhad two more children born in Plymouth. Five of their children (Jane, \r\nJohn, Jacob, Hester, and Mary) left descendants. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Edward \r\nDoty</strong> came as a servant to Stephen Hopkins. He married twice and had \r\nnine children by his second wife (Edward, John, Thomas, Samuel, Desire, \r\nElizabeth, Isaac, Joseph, and Mary), all of whom left descendants. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Francis Eaton, </strong>representing <em>MP</em>s wife Sarah and son \r\nSamuel. Samuel survived to have descendants. Sarah died in the first \r\nwinter and Francis remarried twice. By his third wife, Christian Penn, \r\nhe had three children, two of whom (Rachel and Benjamin), left \r\ndescendants. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Moses Fletcher </strong>came alone and returned to \r\nHolland. He married twice and at his death left ten children, thirteen \r\ngrandchildren, and twenty great-grandchildren, all in Holland. One line \r\nof descent has been accepted by the Mayflower Society. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Edward\r\n Fuller, </strong>representing <em>MP</em>s wife, name unknown, and son Samuel.\r\n Edward&#8217;s wife died in January 1621. Their older son Matthew had \r\nremained in England, but came to the colony later. Both Matthew and \r\nSamuel left descendants. Edward was the brother of <em>MP</em> Samuel \r\nFuller. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Samuel Fuller</strong>, brother of <em>MP</em> Edward \r\nFuller, Samuel left his third wife, Bridget Lee, and their son Samuel \r\nbehind in Holland (he had three children by his second wife, Agnes \r\nCarpenter, who died without issue). Samuel, Jr., later came to New \r\nEngland and left descendants. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Stephen Hopkins, </strong>representing\r\n <em>MP</em>s second wife Elizabeth, sons Giles and Oceanus, and daughters\r\n Constance and Damaris. Constance and Giles were by Stephen&#8217;s first wife\r\n and both survived to leave descendants. Stephen and Elizabeth&#8217;s \r\nchildren Damaris and Oceanus who were on the <em>Mayflower</em> both died \r\nyoung, but the couple had five more children born in Plymouth. Of these,\r\n only two daughters, Deborah and another Damaris, left descendants. </li>\r\n<li><strong>John Howland</strong>, representing <em>MP</em> (later wife) Elizabeth \r\nTilley, daughter of John Tilley. John and Elizabeth had ten children \r\n(Desire, John, Hope, Elizabeth, Lydia, Hannah, Joseph, Jabez, Ruth, and \r\nIsaac), all of whom left descendants. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Richard More</strong> came\r\n as a child with his three siblings, Jasper, Ellen, and Mary, who all \r\ndied in the first winter. Richard married twice and had seven children \r\nby his first wife, but only three (Richard, Susanna, and Christian) are \r\nknown to have had children. Of these, only Susanna has known \r\ndescendants. The More children are the only <em>MP</em>s with proved royal\r\n ancestry. </li>\r\n<li><strong>William Mullins</strong>, representing <em>MP</em>s \r\nwife Alice, daughter Priscilla (who later married <strong>John Alden</strong>), \r\nand son Joseph. William, Alice and Joseph all died in the first year. \r\nAlthough William Mullins also had a son and daughter who remained in \r\nEngland, all of his known descendants are through Priscilla. The claim \r\nof Huguenot ancestry for William Mullins is a myth. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Degory \r\nPriest</strong> came alone leaving behind his wife Sarah (a sister of <em>MP</em>\r\n Isaac Allerton) and two daughters, Mary and Sarah. He died in the first\r\n winter, but Sarah and the girls came to New England later. Both girls \r\nmarried and left descendants. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Thomas Rogers</strong>, \r\nrepresenting <em>MP</em> son Joseph Rogers. Thomas died in the winter of \r\n1620/21. His wife had stayed behind with three other surviving children \r\n(two others had died). Joseph survived and he and his brother John have \r\nproved descendants. Two sisters, Elizabeth and Margaret, may have \r\nmarried and had issue, but this has not been authenticated. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Henry\r\n Samson</strong> was a child who came with his cousins Edward and Ann Tilley.\r\n He married and had nine children born in Duxbury, eight of whom left \r\ndescendants (Elizabeth, Hannah, a daughter [name unknown], Mary, Dorcas,\r\n James, Stephen, and Caleb). </li>\r\n<li><strong>George Soule</strong> came alone as\r\n a servant of Edward Winslow. He married in Plymouth and had nine \r\nchildren, seven of whom had descendants. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Myles Standish</strong>,\r\n representing <em>MP</em> first wife Rose, who died in January 1621. Myles\r\n remarried and had seven children, three of whom (Alexander, Myles, and \r\nJosiah) left descendants. </li>\r\n<li><strong>John Tilley</strong>, representing <em>MP</em>s\r\n wife Joan and their youngest daughter Elizabeth (who later married <strong>John\r\n Howland</strong>). John and Joan died in the first year. In 1999 the \r\nMayflower Society also accepted a line through John Tilley&#8217;s son Robert,\r\n who remained in England. </li>\r\n<li><strong>Richard Warren</strong> came alone \r\nleaving his wife Elizabeth and five daughters in England. Elizabeth and \r\nthe girls came later and the Warrens had two sons born in Plymouth. All \r\nseven of the Warren children (Mary, Anna, Sarah, Elizabeth, Abigail, \r\nNathaniel, and Joseph) left descendants. Claims of royal ancestry for \r\nRichard Warren are unfounded. </li>\r\n<li><strong>William White</strong>, \r\nrepresenting <em>MP</em>s wife Susanna and sons Resolved and Peregrine. \r\nWilliam died in February 1621. Susanna remarried, to <em>MP</em> Edward \r\nWinslow (see below). Both Resolved and Peregrine White left descendants.\r\n </li>\r\n<li><strong>Edward Winslow</strong>, representing <em>MP</em>s first wife \r\nElizabeth and second wife Susanna, widow of <strong>William White</strong>. \r\nEdward&#8217;s first wife died soon after landing in Plymouth and his marriage\r\n to the widow Susanna White in May 1621 was the first marriage in the \r\nnew colony. He became stepfather to Susanna&#8217;s two boys, Resolved and \r\nbaby Peregrine White, and he and Susanna had five children born in \r\nPlymouth. Only two, Josiah and Elizabeth, had descendants.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div><p>The Mayflower Society has published books detailing the first four \r\nor five generations of most of these 26 families, which we will discuss \r\nin the next installment of this series. The list of books is available \r\non <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.mayflower.org/\">http://www.mayflower.org/</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For the original, first-hand account of the voyage of the <em>Mayflower</em>\r\n and the early history of Plymouth Colony, William Bradford&#8217;s <em>Of \r\nPlimoth Plantation</em> is a must read, and Samuel Eliot Morrison&#8217;s \r\nedition of that work is the most readable. Another interesting work, <em>Mourt&#8217;s\r\n Relation, A Journal of the Pilgrims at Plymouth,</em> was written by the\r\n first settlers as an enticement to bring more people to the colony. A \r\nmodern compilation that gives details on all of the early colonists is \r\nEugene Aubrey Stratton&#8217;s <em>Plymouth Colony, Its History &amp; People \r\n1620-1691</em> (information for all of the above and other books about \r\nthe Pilgrims can be found on <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.mayflowerhistory.com/\">http://www.mayflowerhistory.com/</a>), and Robert Charles \r\nAnderson&#8217;s new work published by NEHGS, <em>The Pilgrim Migration: \r\nImmigrants to Plymouth Colony, 1620-1633</em> (updated sketches from his \r\nlarger series <em>The Great Migration Begins</em>) provides everything you\r\n need to know about any immigrant to Plymouth Colony before 1634.</p>\r\n <p>The\r\n story of the <em>Mayflower</em> and her passengers was romanticized in \r\nthe nineteenth century by such people as orator Daniel Webster and poet \r\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow (author of the famous poem \"Courtship of \r\nMyles Standish\" that told the story of how Priscilla Mullins was wooed \r\nby both Standish and John Alden). Fanciful and romantic novels were \r\nwritten putting words into the mouths of the Pilgrims and describing \r\nimaginary details of their lives. Often these imaginary details found \r\ntheir way into so-called historical accounts. As the prestige of descent\r\n from a <em>Mayflower</em> passenger rose, the rush to find an ancestor on\r\n that boat led some to ignore good genealogical sources or even to make \r\nup connections that were never there. Since many of the surnames of the <em>MP</em>s\r\n are fairly common, some people have jumped to unfounded conclusions.<span></span>For example, although there were two men on the <em>Mayflower</em>\r\n named Clarke &#8211; Richard, a passenger, and John the mate &#8211; neither man \r\nleft descendants.[1] The Clarke family of Plymouth traces to Thomas \r\nClarke, who came on the ship <em>Anne</em> in 1623.</p>\r\n <p>Many of these \r\nimaginary <em>Mayflower</em> connections can still be found in print and \r\nhave unfortunately been disseminated throughout the Internet, but only \r\nindividuals on the above list are proved passengers of the ship <em>Mayflower.</em>\r\n Further information about the ship, passengers, and settlement in \r\nPlymouth Colony can be found on the websites of Pilgrim Hall (<a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.pilgrimhall.org/\">http://www.pilgrimhall.org/</a>)\r\n and Plimoth Plantation (<a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.plimoth.org/\">http://www.plimoth.org/</a>).\r\n </p>\r\n <p><strong>NOTE:<br></strong>[1] The crew of the <em>Mayflower</em>,\r\n perhaps as many as 25-30 men, are mostly unidentified and (other than \r\nCaptain Christopher Jones) no family information is known about them. \r\nOnly descent from a passenger qualifies for membership in the Mayflower \r\nSociety. </p>\r\n</div></div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/who-came-on-the-mayflower-pt2/", "published": "", "id": 260}, {"author": "", "country": "Massachusetts", "title": "Pilgrim Village Families Sketch: ____ Ford", "content": "<p><strong>Birth</strong>: He was born about 1592, based on his estimated date of marriage.<br><br><strong>Death</strong>: He died in Plymouth Colony between November 11, 1621, and late 1623.<br><br><strong>Ship</strong>: <em>Fortune</em>, 1621<br><br><strong>Life in England</strong>: Nothing is known of his life in England.<br><br><strong>Life in New England</strong>: Ford arrived in Plymouth Colony in the fall of 1621 with his wife, son and daughter.

After 16 months, he returned to England for five months. He sailed from Bristol in March, 1629/30, aboard the&#160;<em>Lyon</em>, in company with Isaac Allerton, arriving in New England in May. Plymouth officials reluctantly supplied him with trade goods. Mistrusting him the officials also sent another new arrival,Thomas Willet, with him as a partner. Ashley continued working at Penobscot until October 1631.At that time he was found trading guns, powder and ammunition to the Natives in direct violation of both his agreement with Plymouth and the King&#8217;s proclamation. He was arrested and returned to England.After a short stay in the Fleet prison,Ashley was released after February 17, 1631/2, but warned never to trade weapons, etc. again.

John Senior challenged Myles Standish&#8217;s \r\norder in March of 1620/1 and was punished for it, the first of many \r\nconfrontations.

Gould", "country": "New Hampshire", "title": "Cemetery Research in New Hampshire", "content": "<p>Cemeteries can be a fundamental source for genealogical information on \r\nseveral levels. On the surface, the researcher gains important information about \r\nthe dates of death and often the dates of birth of an ancestor. The inscription \r\nof the stone frequently contains additional family information such as the name \r\nof spouse(s), parents, or children. In rare circumstances, the place of birth or \r\nlocation of the parents may also be recorded on the stone. Beyond the basic data \r\nrecorded on a headstone, a visit to the cemetery can provide important \r\ninformation to assist in putting family groups together. For instance, whom an \r\nancestor is buried alongside can give the researcher information not easily \r\nobtained elsewhere. As well, the absence of an internment in the last known \r\nlocation of an ancestor gives additional information to add to the puzzle.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>The first challenge is that of locating the grave for a given ancestor. The \r\nusual place to start is the location where your ancestor was last known to be, \r\nand certainly the location of residence at the time of death if known. Often the \r\ndeath certificate will list the place of interment, and published family \r\ngenealogies and town histories are another source for burial information. Most \r\nearly New Hampshire towns had a cemetery associated with the church. Burial \r\nrecords are available for some church cemeteries, and helpful in determining \r\nburial locations if the individual's church affiliation is known. The simplest \r\nprocedure is to contact the church directly, but be aware that some early church \r\nrecords are housed in historical society collections, sometimes not known to \r\nchurch officials. Don't give up easily. </p>\r\n<p>Burial customs in the early days did not dictate burial in a cemetery, making \r\nfamily burial plots quite common. Sometimes these family plots are found in \r\ndeplorable condition. An example, found on the web, is William Meacham's \r\ndiscovery and subsequent restoration of <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~wmeacham/cemrest.htm\">two family plots</a> in Kentucky. Unfortunately, such conditions \r\nbefall family plots in New Hampshire as well.</p>\r\n<p>Each town established other burial grounds as needed in the development of \r\nthe town. The records of the establishment can be found in the early town record \r\nbooks. There is no index to assist in this type of research, but reading the \r\nrecords of a given town will give clues to what cemeteries were established at \r\nwhat time in that locale. Microfilmed copies of these sources are on file at the \r\n<a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://webster.state.nh.us/nhsl/\">New Hampshire State \r\nLibrary</a>, 20 Park St., Concord, NH, 03301, or through the numerous <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\">Family History Centers</a> of \r\nthe Church of Latter-day Saints. The index to the town records is available at \r\nthe NEHGS Library located at 101 Newbury Street in Boston, MA, 02116, and the <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.dar.org/library/default.html\">DAR Library</a> \r\nlocated at 1776 D Street, NW, Washington, DC 20006-5303. (See \"<a href=\"http://www.newenglandancestors.org/education/articles/research/localities/new_hampshire/early_new_hshire_town_records_659_10404.asp\">Early \r\nNew Hampshire Town Records</a>,\" by Edward F. Holden on this site.) Each town \r\nwas responsible for any records, (or the absence thereof) regarding burials in a \r\ntown cemetery, and there is a wide discrepancy in cemetery records from town to \r\ntown. </p>\r\n<p>Obituaries frequently contain the name of the undertaker who handled \r\narrangements for the family. Many old and most of the more recent newspapers \r\nhave been microfilmed and are available through libraries and research centers \r\nacross the country, while the early New Hampshire papers are available at the \r\nNew Hampshire State Library. If the researcher is fortunate enough to have an \r\nancestor who was interred by an undertaker that is still in business, there will \r\nlikely be burial records available to assist in the search through that source. \r\nRefer to the <em>American Blue Book of Funeral Directors</em>, available in most \r\npublic libraries' reference section for contact information. When a funeral home \r\nno longer exists, check with local historical societies and libraries to see if \r\nthe location of their records may be determined. All of this adds to the \r\ncomplexity of finding any given ancestor's resting place!</p>\r\n<p>The US Department of the Interior has a <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://geonames.usgs.gov/\">Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)</a>, which can be \r\nsearched on the web. This site allows the researcher to search for all \r\ncemeteries in a given town, county, or state. A form is provided that allows the \r\nuser to enter information via drop down lists to complete the query of the \r\ndatabase. All that is needed for this purpose is to select the state, which \r\nenables the county to be selected. Next, the user will select the cemetery in \r\nthe drop down list titled \"Feature Type.\" If a specific town is known, the user \r\ncan then type that town name into the field titled \"Topo Map Name.\" The results \r\nwill be a listing of all cemeteries known in a given state, county, and town \r\nwith links to maps of the location. The latitude and longitude are given for the \r\nlocation that can then be used with a GIS hand-held device (click <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.gis.com/\">here</a> for more information about GIS \r\n[Geographic Information Systems]). After a specific cemetery is selected, the \r\nmost helpful map choice for location by automobile is \"Show Feature Location \r\nusing maps produced from the U.S. Census Bureau's Tiger Map Server.\" After \r\nselecting this item, scroll down the page and use the zoom-in feature several \r\ntimes to get a street map for the selected cemetery. The information you receive \r\nis only as good as the information in the database. In this instance, a search \r\nfor all cemeteries in Bradford, NH includes one that is actually located in \r\nSutton, NH and the Presbury Cemetery in Bradford is listed under Hillsboro Upper \r\nVillage, NH. However, one of several family plots located in Bradford does \r\nappear on the list. <br><br>Transcriptions of the gravestones of many New \r\nHampshire cemeteries have been made and printed copies deposited in various \r\nlibraries and historical societies. These transcriptions are attributed to \r\nmembers of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), Works Progress \r\nAdministration (WPA) groups, or other historians. An impressive collection can \r\nbe found at the <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.nhhistory.org/library.html\">New \r\nHampshire Historical Society Tuck Library</a> located at 30 Park St, Concord, \r\nNH, 03301. In preparation for a visit to the library, a <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://nhhistory.library.net/\">search of their collection</a> \r\nfor a specific cemetery can be done online. Entering the search word \"cemetery\" \r\nin that search engine produces 327 items. The NEHGS Library also has an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://library.nehgs.org/\">online catalog</a>. Using that \r\nsearch, it is necessary to search for variants such as \"Gravestone Inscriptions \r\nNew Hampshire\" as well as \"Cemeteries NH\" to get a more complete listing. The <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.dar.org/library/default.html\">DAR Library</a> in \r\nWashington, DC has many transcription records in their holdings. A <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.dar.org/library/onlinlib.html\">search</a> can be \r\ncompleted online for these as well. The most effective way to isolate your \r\nsearch on that engine is to enter a search for a title as follows: \"Cemetery \r\nRecords {Insert Town Name}, {Insert State Abbr.}.\" It is also a good idea to \r\ncheck with the local historical society when the researcher has an idea of the \r\nlocation of an ancestor's burial to see if they may have transcription records \r\nnot published or deposited elsewhere. The benefit of these records is that the \r\nresearcher can check out a hunch of an ancestor's burial location and if luck \r\nprevails, obtain inscription information without an intensive stroll through the \r\nmany cemeteries of a given locality. </p>\r\n<p>The next step is a visit to the cemetery. You should first check with the \r\ntown to see what, if any, restrictions and guidelines exist for the cemetery in \r\nquestion. The following items will assist you with transcribing the \r\ngravestones:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>writing utensils \r\n</li>\r\n<li>paper \r\n</li>\r\n<li>outdoor clothing appropriate for the weather \r\n</li>\r\n<li>hat with visor \r\n</li>\r\n<li>sunglasses \r\n</li>\r\n<li>bug repellent \r\n</li>\r\n<li>sunscreen \r\n</li>\r\n<li>mirror \r\n</li>\r\n<li>flashlight \r\n</li>\r\n<li>cardboard roll such as an empty paper towel roll \r\n</li>\r\n<li>mild soap \r\n</li>\r\n<li>lots of water \r\n</li>\r\n<li>soft nylon or natural brush \r\n</li>\r\n<li>wooden scraper such as a popsicle stick \r\n</li>\r\n<li>grass cutters, trowel, etc. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>camera</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Depending on where the light is at the time, and given the weather conditions \r\non the day of your visit, you may find the inscription difficult to read. By \r\nmaneuvering the light over the inscription using the mirror, flashlight and tube \r\nyou will find that readability can be greatly increased. Do not use any chemical \r\ningredients on the stone to highlight the inscription or clean it, as this may \r\ndamage the stone. You may find that lichen or other organic matter has covered \r\nthe inscription. In this event soak the debris with mild soapy water and work it \r\noff with the soft brush or wooden scraper. Metal and chemicals should never be \r\nused. Be sure to thoroughly flush the detergent from the stone when done. If you \r\nintend to do plantings, trim grass or clear the base of a sunken stone, be sure \r\nyou have the tools you will need and know just what the guidelines are for the \r\ncemetery.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to record the inscription even if you intend to photograph \r\nthe stone. It's a good idea to take a thorough look at the stones surrounding \r\nthat of your particular interest. Take a record of anything that appears \r\nremotely related, to avoid repeating a trip when some new evidence makes the \r\nremotely possible now probable! Following these methods should assist \r\nresearchers in finding valuable information about their New Hampshire \r\nancestors.</p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/cemetery-research-in-new-hampshire/", "published": "March 15, 2002", "id": 332}, {"author": "Sherry L. Gould", "country": "New Hampshire", "title": "Did Your Ancestor Really Remove to New Hampshire in the 1700s?", "content": "<p>The early settlers of New Hampshire differed from their neighbors in \r\nMassachusetts primarily in their intentions for life in the new land.&#160; \r\nWhile the Pilgrims first settled Massachusetts in 1620 (the Puritans \r\narrived roughly a decade later), New Hampshire&#8217;s first English subjects \r\nwere loyal to the Church of England. Rather than religious freedom, they\r\n were interested in fishing, trading, and other pursuits aimed at \r\nreturning a profit. A century of competing interests in lands granted by\r\n the neighboring provinces can be reviewed in the numerous histories of \r\nthe state. This article focuses on the border dispute between New \r\nHampshire and Massachusetts that was settled in 1741. As part of the \r\nsettlement, King George II named Benning Wentworth governor at \r\nPortsmouth, over a province further separated from the Bay Colony.&#160; The \r\nsettlement also changed the border, which has created lasting confusion \r\nfor family historians regarding the location of their ancestors in \r\nnorthern Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire during that time \r\nframe.</p>\r\n<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p>The original grant of New Hampshire to John Mason, Esquire,&#160;of \r\nLondon, on November 7, 1629 contained the first mention of the Merrimack\r\n River as the southern boundary of the state.<sup>1</sup> The area of \r\nthe grant north of the river proceeded up New Hampshire&#8217;s short coast to\r\n the Maine border and sixty miles up the Salmon Falls River (as it is \r\nknown today), then on an arched course back to the southern border near \r\nthe area of Dunstable, Massachusetts. The border was recorded in the \r\nearly records of the Massachusetts Bay Company as three miles north of \r\nthe outlet of the Merrimack River where it met the Atlantic on the east,\r\n to a point where it was mistakenly believed the course of the river ran\r\n westerly across the length of the border.<sup>2</sup> The northwesterly\r\n course of the river was later discovered, but Massachusetts held to the\r\n river as the border.<sup>3</sup> As a result, the Bay Colony granted \r\nnew townships throughout the Merrimack River valley area and other areas\r\n west of the Merrimack in what is now New Hampshire. New Hampshire went \r\nahead and issued grants on competing land to her sons.<sup>4</sup> On \r\nthe eastern border, the original three-mile mark was overshot north of \r\nthe outlet of the Merrimack, adding land to Salisbury, Massachusetts, at\r\n the expense of the area of Hampton Falls, New Hampshire. </p>\r\n<p>On July 16, 1713, after peace with France and the eastern native \r\ntribes was achieved by Queen Ann, a committee was chosen to work with \r\ncontemporaries from Massachusetts &#8220;to run ye devideing line between the \r\nProvinces According to the Royall Charter Granted to the Massathusetts.<sup>5</sup>In\r\n 1726, Lieutenant Governor John Wentworth appealed to the king to \r\nestablish a boundary line between the two colonies.<sup>6</sup> The two \r\nprovinces continued to demonstrate that a settlement was not to be \r\nreached mutually. After much ado, on June 5, 1734, the Lords of Trade \r\naccepted the opinion of New Hampshire&#8217;s attorney general and the \r\nsolicitor general and reported that the king should appoint \r\ncommissioners comprised of representatives from the provinces of New \r\nYork, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Nova Scotia to settle the line.<sup>7</sup>\r\n Upon completion of their work, the commissioners had a doubt in point \r\nof law and referred the matter to the king in council. </p>\r\n<p>The lingering dispute was taken up on August 5, 1740. At that time it\r\n was determined that &#8220;The Northern Boundaries of the Province of the \r\nMassachusetts Bay, are and be a similar curve line Pursuing the course \r\nof the Merrimack River, at three miles distance, on the north side \r\nthereof, beginning at the Atlantic Ocean and ending at a point due north\r\n of a place in the plan returned by the said Commissioners, called \r\nPawtucket Falls, and a strait line drawn from thence due west, cross the\r\n said river till it meet his Majesty&#8217;s other Governments.&#8221;<sup>8</sup> </p>\r\n<p>This decision was given to Governor Belcher who served as governor of\r\n both provinces. Much accusation has been made regarding his leanings \r\ntoward New Hampshire in the form of bribes and such.<sup>9</sup> The \r\nsubjects of Massachusetts were well known to the Monarch as more \r\nrebellious and difficult to rule. New Hampshire&#8217;s small landmass and \r\nsparse population caused her to be quite interdependent on her rebel \r\nneighbors to the south. No doubt the New Hampshire subjects&#8217; loyalty to \r\nthe Church of England, and other politics of the mother country, played \r\ninto the settling of the border in 1741 to what we have today, much in \r\nNew Hampshire&#8217;s favor. </p>\r\n<p>Prior to the settlement of this issue, citizens were frequently \r\ncaught in uncertainty. It was not uncommon for those in the disputed \r\nterritories to be taxed by both provinces. At times the other province \r\npenalized citizens for refusal of payment when they had paid tax to the \r\nprovince, which they believed they were a part of. Property was taken \r\nand, in some instances, townspeople were imprisoned. The settled line \r\ncut many border towns apart. Families wound up residing in different \r\nstates, let alone towns. Settlers had to travel many miles to their \r\nmeetinghouse, rather than the one close by, which they had helped to \r\nbuild. </p>\r\n<p>One area greatly affected was <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://docs.unh.edu/MA/lowl93nw.jpg\">Dunstable, \r\nMassachusetts</a>. The title page of <em>History of the Old Township of \r\nDunstable: including Nashua, Nashville, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, and \r\nMerrimac, N.H.; Dunstable and Tyngsborough, Mass.</em>, by Charles J. Fox\r\n (Nashua, 1846) gives part of the picture of what became of Dunstable. A\r\n map on page 12 of that volume shows that Dunstable encompassed all of \r\nBrookline and Milford; parts of Mason, Wilton, Lyndeborough, Mount \r\nVernon, Amherst, Londonderry, Windham and Pelham, NH; and parts of \r\nTownsend, Shirley, Groton, Westford, Chelmsford, Lowell and Dracut, MA.&#160;\r\n Nottingham had been carved out from the easterly side of the Merrimack \r\nRiver and granted by the Bay Colony to the inhabitants of Dunstable \r\nresiding in that part of town in 1732.<sup>10</sup> This area fell into \r\nNew Hampshire when the line was settled in 1741. The province of New \r\nHampshire chartered Nottingham-West in 1746. The addition of &#8220;West&#8221; was \r\nadded due to the existing town of Nottingham in the eastern area of the \r\nstate. Nottingham-West became Hudson in 1830.</p>\r\n<p>In the <em>History of the town of Hollis, New Hampshire, from its \r\nfirst settlement to the year 1879</em>, by Samuel T Worchester (Nashua, \r\n1879); one may read all about the ebb and flow of towns such as Monson, \r\n(a town which existed for 24 years), Duxbury, Mile Slip, Raby, etc. On a\r\n <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.nhhistory.org/libraryexhibits/maps/blancharddet.html\">map of New Hampshire</a> done by Col. Joseph Blanchard in \r\n1761, Nottingham-West is on the east side of the Merrimack River, \r\nDunstable on the west side of the same river, Hollis west of Dunstable \r\non the Massachusetts border, and Monson directly north of Hollis. The \r\nsame is visible on <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/gmd:@field%28NUMBER+@band%28g3720+ar081200%29%29\">Bowles's New Pocket Map</a>&#160;of 1780, except Monson is not \r\nshown. Jeremy Belknap's &#8220;New Map of New Hampshire,&#8221;1791, shows Dunstable\r\n and Hollis with Litchfield in place, but it does not show \r\nNottingham-West, or Hudson. </p>\r\n<p>The title and explanations pages from <em>Dunstable </em>(MA)<em> Vital \r\nRecords</em> <em>to 1850</em> do not address the issue of early records and\r\n the border dispute, except to state, \"The early records of the \r\nCongregational Church, organized in 1685, now the First Congregational \r\nChurch of Nashua, New Hampshire, cannot be found.\" An interesting \r\nquestion for another day is whether vital records are reported in both \r\nlocations.</p>\r\n<p><a target=\"new\" href=\"http://docs.unh.edu/NH/nwbr95se.jpg\">Hampton, \r\nNew Hampshire</a> is another area that was affected by the moving \r\nborder. Dow covers the many changes that occurred in the southern \r\nregions of the town in <em>The History of Hampton.</em><sup><em>11</em></sup>\r\n Page 145 of that volume gives the circumstances surrounding the \r\nformation of the town of South Hampton incorporated in 1742 with \r\nindividuals who were originally in the towns of Salisbury and Amesbury, \r\nMassachusetts. So an ancestor born in Salisbury, Massachusetts might \r\nwell die in South Hampton, New Hampshire without ever having moved. \r\nOther Massachusetts towns affected were Haverhill, Methuen and Dracut.<sup>12</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>In the final analysis, researchers who find ancestors in these border\r\n towns of New Hampshire during this time frame should carefully consult \r\nvital records on both sides of the border. Land records will also be \r\nhelpful to see if indeed their ancestors moved or whether instead they \r\nwere involved in this moving border matter. </p>\r\n<p>1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Albert Stillman Bachellor, <em>State Papers New Hampshire</em> \r\nvol.

Holden", "country": "New Hampshire", "title": "Early New Hampshire Town Records", "content": "<p>The microfilm collection of Early New Hampshire Town Records is an \r\nimportant resource for researching families who lived in the Granite \r\nState more than a century and a half ago. Many of the collection's 363 \r\nreels contain two and even three volumes, and they are available at the \r\nGenealogy and Local History Room at the <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://webster.state.nh.us/nhsl/\">New Hampshire \r\nState Library </a>or through the numerous <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\">Family History Centers\r\n </a>of the Church of Latter-day Saints. The State Library staff will \r\nalso accept reasonable requests for searches of the records by phone \r\n([603] 271-6823), fax ([603] 271-2205), e-mail \r\n(zmoore@library.state.nh.us), and traditional mail (NHSL Genealogy \r\nSection 20 Park St., Concord, NH, 03301). If the information is found, \r\nthe library will send 8.5 x 11 photocopies of the images at 10 cents per\r\n sheet with a one-dollar minimum for mailing the information via USPS. </p>\r\n<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p>The key to the host of information contained in the thousands of \r\npages of this collection is the microfilm index, which is arranged \r\nalphabetically by surname. Some of the types of records found in these \r\nfilms are vital records, tax records, listings of residents by districts\r\n within a town, offices to which men were elected, town meeting minutes,\r\n and more. </p>\r\n<p>For example, a family historian searching for information about Amos \r\nC. Clement of Plaistow, NH, would find these entries typed on the image \r\nof the 5 x 3 card appearing on the the index reel: </p>\r\n<blockquote><p><em>Clement, Amos C. Plaistow <br>Volume 2: p. 324, p. 523, p. 808 \r\n(M.R.) p. 808 (F.R.)</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Going next to the above microfilm of Plaistow, the researcher would \r\ndiscover the following information about Amos C. Clement: </p>\r\n<blockquote><p><em>p. 324 - In 1817 Amos Clement received $50.00 from the town in \r\nreturn for<br>boarding William Dow for one year. <br>p. 523 - Amos \r\nClement was elected Fence Viewer in 1819<br>p. 808 - Amos C. Clement \r\nmarried Sarah Dow April 29, 1817<br>p. 808 - The children of Amos and \r\nSarah Clement were<br>Amos Carlton born November 26, 1819<br>Hannah born\r\n December 29, 1821<br>Isaac born April 16, 1824<br>Louise born March 17,\r\n 1826</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nExcept for births and marriages the index \r\nitself does not provide any clues about the nature of the entries to \r\nwhich it refers. A marriage record is indicated on the index cards as a \r\npage number followed by (M.R.). Researchers intending to use a marriage \r\nrecord to trace their ancestors back another generation are usually \r\nthwarted in using the information in this collection because the town \r\nclerks almost never listed the names of the parents of the bride and \r\ngroom in these early town records. The symbol (F.R.) rather than the \r\nmore logical (B.R.) signals a birth record. Some death notices do appear\r\n in the town records, but they are not indexed by (D.R.) or any other \r\nsymbol. In very rare instances deaths are included and are also \r\nreferenced on the index card by (F.R.). \r\n<p>A small number of individuals rate only one entry on a single index \r\ncard. At the other end of the scale are 182 entries for Matthew Patten \r\nspread over five towns with 165 of those entries being in his hometown \r\nof Bedford. Just one of those page numbers is followed by the symbol \r\n(F.R.) and no entry indicates a marriage record. To determine the event \r\nto which the other 181 Matthew Patten entries refer requires examining \r\neach one individually. </p>\r\n<p>There are two precautions to observe when studying these early town \r\nrecords. </p>\r\n<p>Caveat one: To avoid potential disappointment, patrons should not \r\napproach this collection with the firm belief that it is the nirvana of \r\nearly New Hampshire vital records. As indicated above, some births and \r\nmarriages can be found therein, but several years of staff experience \r\nwith the data in this collection indicate that the odds of finding \r\nrecords of births and marriages are about four or five to one. \r\nNevertheless, on many occasions these microfilms do yield the date and \r\nplace for a previously elusive record of a birth or marriage that \r\noccurred in New Hampshire prior to about 1840. </p>\r\n<p>Caveat two: Be aware that two different systems are employed in \r\nnumbering the pages of these records. Handwritten numbers appear in the \r\nmargins of the pages, while stamped numbers appear in the upper corners \r\nof the pages. The indexes refer to the stamped numbers. </p>\r\n<p>To the experienced researcher these records can be revealing in \r\naspects other than simply providing possible information about births \r\nand marriages. A person's changing economic status can be traced by \r\nfollowing his tax assessments from year to year. A Warning Out Of Town \r\nnotice often includes not only the name of the family head, but also \r\nlists other members of the family, and indicates their previous \r\nresidence. When minors are involved these warning notices usually state \r\ntheir ages. School district numbers are also listed in many of these \r\nrecords, thereby pinpointing the part of town in which an ancestor \r\nlived. </p>\r\n<p>\"The Every Name Index\" is the erroneous and misleading title that is \r\noften applied to \"The Index to Early New Hampshire Town Records.\" By no \r\nstretch of a wishful imagination does this collection contain the name \r\nof every New Hampshire resident who lived during the two centuries it \r\ncovers. The records of seventeen towns (including the seminal \r\ncommunities of Exeter and Dover) were not indexed due to reasons for \r\nwhich no documentation has been found. These unindexed towns are \r\nidentified in a loose-leaf binder with the cumbersome title \"Catalog of \r\nAncient Towns, Parishes, and Other Divisions of the State as Recorded in\r\n the Office of the Secretary of State,\" which can be found with the \r\nfiling cabinet that houses the microfilms in the New Hampshire State \r\nLibrary. </p>\r\n<p>The other fifteen towns not indexed are: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Brookline </li>\r\n<li>Dublin </li>\r\n<li>Fitzwilliam </li>\r\n<li>Goffstown </li>\r\n<li>Keene </li>\r\n<li>Litchfield </li>\r\n<li>Lyndeborough </li>\r\n<li>Manchester </li>\r\n<li>Marlborough </li>\r\n<li>Merrimack </li>\r\n<li>Milan </li>\r\n<li>Nashua </li>\r\n<li>New Boston </li>\r\n<li>Pembroke </li>\r\n<li>Swanzey </li>\r\n<li>Tamworth</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Indexes to these volumes are also missing: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Conway 2, 3, 4 </li>\r\n<li>Deerfield 3 </li>\r\n<li>Hollis 7 </li>\r\n<li>Lisbon 2, 3 </li>\r\n<li>Meredith 2 </li>\r\n<li>Newcastle 1, 3 </li>\r\n<li>Northumberland 2 </li>\r\n<li>Rye 2 </li>\r\n<li>Springfield 2 </li>\r\n<li>Stratford 2 </li>\r\n<li>Whitefield 2. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Another fact contradicting the \"Every Name Index\" title is the \r\nscarcity of Native American and African American names. Only 54 slaves \r\nand 4 Indians are indexed for the entire two centuries these records \r\nencompass, yet the 1790 census indicates that the \"colored\" population \r\nin New Hampshire in that year alone was 150. Other African Americans \r\nwere among the 620 people under the category \"All other free persons,\" \r\nalso in the 1790 census. </p>\r\n<p>The indexing was rumored to be funded by a WPA project during the \r\nDepression of the 1930s. It is quite possible that the funds ran out \r\nbefore the work was completed. The volumes themselves are contained in \r\nthe microfilm collection of the library, so anybody willing to wade \r\nthrough hundreds of pages may find relevant information about their \r\nunindexed ancestor. </p>\r\n<p>On page 8 of <em>Digging For Treasure in New England Town Records </em>(NEHGS,\r\n 1996) Ann Smith Lainhart writes that the New Hampshire State Library \r\nborrowed these volumes and made transcript copies. Documented facts seem\r\n to provide much stronger evidence that the New Hampshire Secretary of \r\nState called these records in from the town clerks throughout the state \r\nto be copied or, in some instances, photostated. </p>\r\n<p>1. These lines appear on the Madbury page of the \"Catalog of Ancient \r\nTowns, Parishes, and other Divisions of the State as Recorded in the \r\nOffice of the Secretary of State\": <br><br>\"Original records returned to\r\n Town Clerk Feb. 25, 1919. <strong>Same volume returned to Secretary of State\r\n for recording, September 2, 1948</strong>.\"</p>\r\n<p>2. Until three years ago, researchers could borrow only the indexes \r\nthrough the many Family History Centers. When the Mormons filmed these \r\nrecords in Concord during the middle of the twentieth century, the New \r\nHampshire Secretary of State permitted them to do so only if public \r\naccess to the films were restricted to the Genealogy Library in Salt \r\nLake City. Through the combined efforts of the author of this article \r\nand Dr. Frank Mevers, Director of the New Hampshire State Archives (a \r\ndivision of the Office of the Secretary of State), the restriction was \r\nlifted in 1999. Since the current Secretary of State had authority to \r\nrevoke the order of a previous holder of that office, it seems \r\nreasonable to assume that the early town records were copied by the \r\nauthority of that office, rather than by the State Library. </p>\r\n<p>In conclusion it should be emphasized that despite the shortcomings \r\nof the Early New Hampshire Town Records, family historians who ignore \r\nthis source of genealogical data do so at their own risk. Used \r\nintelligently, this collection of microfilms may very well provide \r\ninformation that cannot be found in any other source. </p>\r\n<p><em>This is an expanded version of an article which appeared in the \r\nJanuary, 2002, issue of </em>Granite State Libraries <em>newsletter.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Edward F.

Probate files are probably one of the greatest \r\ngenealogical sources of information next to vital records. New Hampshire\r\n does not have all vital record information in one central location. \r\nRegistration of births, marriages, and deaths to the town or state was \r\nnot required until the 1800s. This factor makes the probate record an \r\nimportant source for confirmation of the children of a given individual.\r\n It can also provide the given name for the wife, which otherwise would \r\nnot be known. Other times the name will indicate a match to a given name\r\n from a first marriage, or to a new given name, indicating a second \r\nmarriage.</p>\r\n<p>The earliest period available is \r\ncontained in the <a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/P.pdf\" target=\"new\">Provincial probate records</a> (pg. 53) covering the years \r\nbetween the 1630s through 1772. These are comprised of the original \r\nrecords in file boxes that go beyond those contained in the published \r\nNew Hampshire State Papers (a copy of which is also housed in the \r\nArchives). The published New Hampshire State Papers are available in \r\nreference libraries around the country, but these original documents are\r\n not. What is unique to the Archives is the card index file. This index \r\nallows easy location of any probate record included in the State Papers \r\nor the original files.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/R.pdf\" target=\"new\">Rockingham County\r\n probate records</a> <a name=\"_Hlt11252610\"></a><a name=\"_Hlt11252161\"></a>(pg.\r\n 10), covering the years of 1772 through 1918, is a valuable part of the\r\n probate collection. These records contain the individual files \r\navailable on microfilm as well as the filmed index. <a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/M.pdf\" target=\"new\">Merrimack County \r\nprobate records</a> <a name=\"_Hlt11252316\"></a>(pg. 13) are indexed and \r\nspan the years 1827 through 1984. The record volumes 1 to 421 are along \r\nthe west wall of the addition and the individual files are alphabetical \r\non microfiche. In addition, the Grafton County probate records, \r\nconsisting of individual files, can be found covering the years 1775 \r\nthrough 1899. <a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/C.pdf\" target=\"new\">Cheshire\r\n County probate records</a> <a name=\"_Hlt11252885\"></a>(pg. 12) are \r\navailable for the years 1771 to 1899 and are indexed through the card \r\nindex with box numbers for the individual files on microfilm. The \r\nprinted index to the probate records of Hillsborough County (1771-1883) \r\ncan be viewed there as well. The actual Hillsborough County probate \r\nrecords are housed in Nashua, NH and cannot be accessed through the \r\nArchives.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Land Records<br></strong>The next \r\nitem to consider is the <a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/D.pdf\" target=\"new\">deeds collection</a> (pg. 4). Deeds can give the \r\ngenealogical researcher many valuable clues to family matters. Family \r\nrelations are sometimes revealed in these documents when parents deeded \r\nproperty to children or when a wife signed off her dower rights. It is \r\nalso important to note the witnesses to any deed. These witnesses can \r\ngive valuable clues to family and associates of a given ancestor. The \r\ndeeds collection at the Archives consists of the following records: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> <div><a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/P.pdf\" target=\"new\">Provincial Period\r\n deeds</a> (pg. 53,1630s to 1772) </div></li>\r\n<li> <div><a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/R.pdf\" target=\"new\">Rockingham County deeds</a> (pg. 10, 1772 to 1823) </div></li>\r\n<li> <div><a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/G.pdf\" target=\"new\">Grafton County \r\ndeeds</a> <a name=\"_Hlt11253037\"></a>(pg. 9, 1773 to 1870).</div></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These deeds are indexed and available on \r\nmicrofilm.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Petitions</strong></p>\r\n<p>Petitions to the governor, council and legislature \r\nare filed at the Archives. These documents give the researcher some meat\r\n to hang on the framework of vital records for a family.&#160; The interests \r\nand pursuits of the early settlers of New Hampshire can be learned from \r\nthese petitions. This resource will provide an example of original \r\nsignatures, as unlike deeds and probate, the petitions are original \r\ndocuments rather than transcribed copies made by clerks. The petition \r\ncollection covers the period from 1679 to 1850 and is partially indexed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Military Records</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/M.pdf\" target=\"new\">Military</a> indices (pg. 16) consist of the following \r\nrecords: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> <div><a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/W.pdf\" target=\"new\">Potter&#8217;s<em> \r\nMilitary History of New Hampshire</em> </a>(pg. 3) </div></li>\r\n<li> <div><a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/R.pdf\" target=\"new\">Revolutionary War Index</a> (pg. 6) </div></li>\r\n<li> <div><a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/W.pdf\" target=\"new\">War of 1812 Index</a> (pg. 3) </div></li>\r\n<li> <div><a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/C.pdf\" target=\"new\">Ayling&#8217;s Civil War Records</a> (pg. 16)</div></li>\r\n<li> <div><a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/C.pdf\" target=\"new\">Civil War pension records</a> (pg. 16) </div></li>\r\n<li> <div><a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/C.pdf\" target=\"new\">Civil War enlistment cards</a> (pg. 16).&#160; </div></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This is probably the most heavily used collection \r\nof the Archive for genealogical purposes, according to Director Frank \r\nMevers. In addition to providing the location of an individual at the \r\ntime of enlistment, military records give the age and sometimes even the\r\n physical description of an ancestor.

The latter are the association tests that \r\nthe state required each town to construct showing fidelity to the cause \r\nof American independence. There are important nuances to each of these \r\ncensuses and the staff of the Archives will cover those with the \r\nresearcher at the time of a visit.

Except \r\nfor the 1890 census, which was mostly destroyed, they are currently \r\navailable through 1920. All except the 1870 and 1910 enumerations are \r\nindexed in at least one format. </p>\r\n <p>For the provincial period, \r\nenumerations exist for the years 1732, 1744, 1767, and 1776. All are \r\navailable at the New Hampshire Records and Archives, and, except for \r\n1732, appear in the multivolume set of New Hampshire Provincial and \r\nState Papers, copies of which are available at many libraries throughout\r\n the state. </p>\r\n <p>The 1800 census does not include the following towns\r\n in Rockingham County: Atkinson, Greenland, Hampton, Hampton Falls, \r\nLondonderry, Northampton, Pelham, Plaistow, Salem, Seabrook, Stratham, \r\nand Windham. In Strafford County the 1800 census is missing for the \r\ntowns of Alton, Barnstead, Brookfield, Effingham, Gilmanton, Middleton, \r\nNew Durham, Ossipee, Tuftonboro, Wakefield, and Wolfeboro. Fortunately, \r\nresearchers now have access to contemporaneous information for residents\r\n of all of these Strafford County towns except Barnstead and Gilmanton. \r\nThe source of this information is the 1798 direct tax list, which I \r\ndiscovered among the uncatalogued holdings of the Wolfeboro Historical \r\nSociety. This list provides not only the occupant of the property but \r\nalso the name and residence of the owner of the property, if the owner \r\nis not the occupant. This book, entitled 1798 Direct Tax, New Hampshire \r\nDistrict #13, was published in 1989 by Heritage Books and is currently \r\nout of print. It is available in many libraries in the State of New \r\nHampshire, including the New Hampshire Historical Society, New Hampshire\r\n State Library, Wolfeboro Public Library, New Durham Public Library, and\r\n the New Hampshire State Archives. It is also available at the NEHGS \r\nlibrary. The original schedule has been given to the New Hampshire State\r\n Archives for safe keeping. At this point, it is the only known \r\nsurviving 1798 direct tax list for any section of New Hampshire. </p>\r\n <p>All\r\n of the 1820 census records for Grafton County and parts of Rockingham \r\n(Gosport, Greenland, New Castle, Newington, Portsmouth, and Rye) were \r\nlost. Only Center Harbor, Gilford, Moultonborough, New Hampton, and \r\nSanbornton records are available for Strafford County for that year. </p>\r\n<p>The division of Records Management and Archives for the State of New\r\n Hampshire, located on Fruit Street in Concord, N.H., has original U.S. \r\ncensus schedules for 1850-1880. It also has 1840 records for Rockingham,\r\n Merrimack, and Stafford Counties. Microfilm copies of 1800-1880 \r\ncensuses, and printed copies of 1790 and 1800 censuses, plus printed \r\nindexes to later censuses are available at the State Library on Park \r\nStreet in Concord, N.H. </p>\r\n <p>The New Hampshire Historical Society, \r\nalso located on Park Street in Concord, has a photostat of the 1800 \r\ncensus, the published 1790 and 1800 censuses, and published indexes to \r\nlater census years. U.S. census records for New Hampshire (1800-1920) \r\nare available from the National Archives, New England Region, 380 \r\nTrapelo Road, Waltham, MA 01254. Unfortunately, the contrast on some of \r\nthe microfilmed census records is so weak that images on many pages are \r\nabsolutely illegible. This frustrating situation, which is especially \r\nprevalent with the 1860 census sheets, is due to the combination of \r\nfaded ink on the original documents and the inability of the camera and \r\nthe material used in filming the originals to reproduce what little \r\ncontrast survives on the written page. Fortunately the original volumes \r\nof census records for the year 1860, the year most prone to the output \r\nof unreadable microfilm, can be inspected by the researcher at the New \r\nHampshire State Archives. Although the ink on many of the pages in these\r\n originals has faded to a faint brown the essential entries are still \r\nreadable. </p>\r\n <p>The Accelerated Indexing System (AIS) Index appears to\r\n be less accurate for the 1860 census records than it is for the 1790 to\r\n 1850 census records. Thus, if an entry cannot be found in the 1860 AIS \r\nIndex or does not locate the person on the indicated page, it is prudent\r\n to make a page by page examination of the records of the town or city \r\nin which the ancestor probably lived. The index to the 1880, 1900, and \r\n1920 census records is called the Soundex. </p>\r\n <p>The 1900 federal \r\ncensus in particular has a number of useful features. In column 7 the \r\nindividual's month and year of birth is given. Column 10 reveals the \r\nnumber of years of marriage for each married person. The number of \r\nchildren born to each woman is given in column 11 -- this can help you \r\ndetermine whether all children in a given family have been identified \r\nand whether any were deceased when the census was taken. The year of \r\nimmigration to the United States is given in column 16--this might help \r\nyou locate a ship passenger arrival list. An individual's naturalization\r\n status in given in column 18 (\"Al\" for alien, \"Pa\" for first papers, \r\nand \"Na\" for naturalized). His or her parents' birthplace is indicated \r\nin columns 14 and 15. Column 25 tells us whether the individual owned \r\n(\"O\") or rented (\"R\") the home or farm and column 26 whether the home or\r\n farm was mortgaged (\"M\") or free of mortgage (\"F\"). These clues can \r\nlead a researcher to a county recorder's office or equivalent agency for\r\n records of deeds, mortgages, and property tax. </p>\r\n <p>For a complete \r\ndiscussion of the information provided by each federal census, the \r\nresearcher is referred to two excellent articles by Claire \r\nPrechtel-Kluskens: </p>\r\n <ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li><a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.nara.gov/publications/record/may98/family.html\">Clues in Census Records, 1790-1840 </a></li>\r\n<li><a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.nara.gov/genealogy/cenclues.html\">Clues \r\nin Census Records, 1850-1920 </a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div></div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/new-hampshire-census-records/", "published": "", "id": 337}, {"author": "Sherry L.

This was of the Church of \r\nEngland variety, established by those early settlers of the region at \r\ntheir own expense.<sup><a href=\"http://www.newenglandancestors.org/education/articles/research/localities/new_hampshire/new_hshire_church_records_659_10412.asp#one\">1</a></sup>\r\n In 1642 John Winthrop documented in his journal the summoning of Rev. \r\nRichard Gibson to the Massachusetts General Court for baptizing and \r\nmarrying in the hierarchy and discipline of England at the small fishing\r\n village.<sup><a href=\"http://www.newenglandancestors.org/education/articles/research/localities/new_hampshire/new_hshire_church_records_659_10412.asp#two\">2</a></sup>\r\n Rev. Gibson was effectively removed from the community as a result. \r\nSoon after, the wave of Puritan settlers from Massachusetts pushed their\r\n way to this area, establishing Puritan or Congregational churches along\r\n the way in Hampton and other communities. The Massachusetts Bay \r\nrepresentatives wanted to incorporate the New Hampshire settlements into\r\n their commonwealth. A concession was given to the Portsmouth settlers \r\nallowing them to continue to worship at the church of their choice if \r\nthey would accept Massachusetts Bay governance, which they did. They \r\nwere the only community that was given the right to vote though they \r\nwere not required to be members of, or to pay the minister&#8217;s tax for, \r\nthe Congregational Church. (See the United Church of Christ website for \r\nmore on New England <a href=\"http://www.ucc.org/aboutus/shortcourse/congo.htm\" target=\"new\">Puritan\r\n history </a>.)</p>\r\n<p>Massachusetts Puritans lost their right of rule over New Hampshire in\r\n 1676, but the minister&#8217;s rates continued until 1819 when the New \r\nHampshire legislature passed the &#8220;tolerance act,&#8221; which exempted \r\nresidents from local taxation for support of religious worship.<sup><a href=\"http://www.newenglandancestors.org/education/articles/research/localities/new_hampshire/new_hshire_church_records_659_10412.asp#three\">3</a></sup>\r\n During the years preceding this act many other sects had risen and \r\nthrived in New Hampshire including Presbyterians, Quakers, Baptists, and\r\n Methodists, to name a few. The government had allowed for some of these\r\n under an earlier law that made provision for citizens to be excused \r\nfrom the minister&#8217;s rate when they were members of an approved church.<sup><a href=\"http://www.newenglandancestors.org/education/articles/research/localities/new_hampshire/new_hshire_church_records_659_10412.asp#four\">4</a></sup></p>\r\n<strong>Locating\r\n a Church</strong><p>As with any other genealogical source, it is always best to work from\r\n original records. Many transcripts and abstracts exist for various \r\nchurch records. Sources and locations for some of those are given below.\r\n Just keep in mind that with transcriptions or abstracts the possibility\r\n of error is a factor, so consulting original records is best when \r\npossible. Locating original records for New Hampshire churches provides a\r\n definite challenge. </p>\r\n<p>It is always best to start with the church, if it still exists. The \r\npublished history of a given town will be the best source for names of \r\nolder churches located in that town, their dates of existence, etc. An \r\nInternet site that may save you some time when looking for current \r\ncontact information is <a href=\"http://www.churchangel.com/newhamp.htm\" target=\"new\">Church Angel </a>, a directory of churches in the United \r\nStates, broken down by state and town. This appears to be a site where \r\nchurches may voluntarily add their contact information and is therefore \r\nnot an exhaustive listing. However, the contact information for many \r\nchurches can be found there. If this site does not have your church of \r\ninterest, <a href=\"http://www.netministries.org/cgi-bin/nmform02.exe?sortcity=No&amp;country=USA&amp;state=nh\" target=\"new\">Net Ministries </a>, another online church directory, may \r\ngive you the contact information you need. This site is not as well \r\norganized as Church Angel so it is a good idea to check that directory \r\nfirst. If neither of these directories provides the needed information, \r\ncheck the denomination-specific links given below. (Only the largest \r\nfour denominations are covered in this article.) </p>\r\n<strong>Location of \r\nChurch Records</strong><p>Once you have located an existing church that you believe may have \r\nyour ancestor&#8217;s records, check with them to see if they know where their\r\n historical records are located. Records are scattered across a broad \r\nrange of locations, if not lost over time. Many are housed at the local \r\nchurch. Others have been deposited in various repositories within the \r\nchurch denomination. Some are housed at the New Hampshire Historical \r\nSociety or other local historical societies. Still others are part of \r\nprivate collections, some of which are owned by descendents of ministers\r\n who kept their church records. If the chosen church is not able to give\r\n you the location of their records do not stop there. What follows are \r\nsome suggested strategies to locate missing records. </p>\r\n<p>The New Hampshire Historical Records Survey, Service Division, Work \r\nProjects Administration completed a survey of New Hampshire church \r\nrecords in 1942 entitled <em>Guide to Church Vital Statistics in New \r\nHampshire</em> that gives an accounting by town of all church records, \r\nwith locations when known. A printed copy is available at the <a href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/index.html\" target=\"new\">New \r\nHampshire Division of Records Management and Archives </a>(71 South \r\nFruit Street, Concord, NH 03301, tel. [603 271-2236] and at many \r\ngenealogical libraries around the nation. The LDS church has microfilmed\r\n it along with several other <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/eng/Library/fhlcatalog/supermainframeset.asp?display=topicdetails&amp;subject=387462&amp;subject_disp=New_Hampshire_-_Church_records_-_Inventories\" target=\"new\">New Hampshire church record inventories </a>, all of which\r\n can be ordered through your local Family History Center. In 1938, the \r\nHistorical Records Survey Division of Women's and Professional Projects \r\ncompiled an &#8220;Inventory of the Roman Catholic Church Records in New \r\nHampshire.&#8221; Another guide completed the same year by this project gives \r\nthe location of original Protestant Episcopal Diocese records for each \r\ntown. Perhaps these last two were compiled in preparation for the full \r\ninventory completed in 1942, and they appear to be available in all \r\nlocations where the 1942 guide is found. These inventories are now \r\noutdated, but they are still valuable for the information caught in that\r\n snapshot. Here again, if the location of the records you are searching \r\nfor is not given, do not stop there! For instance, the early records for\r\n the town of Pembroke are reported as &#8220;no information given,&#8221; when in \r\nfact, the original records for the early period are housed at the New \r\nHampshire Historical Society. </p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nhhistory.org/library.html\" target=\"new\">Tuck\r\n Library </a>at the New Hampshire Historical Society (30 Park Street, \r\nConcord, NH 03301, tel. [603] 856-0641) houses about two hundred volumes\r\n of original church records representing roughly one hundred churches. \r\nThese are located in the stacks on the second floor. Abstracts of vital \r\nrecords from approximately fifty churches are shelved in the main \r\nreading room. A search of their online catalog produces fifty-five \r\nreturns for &#8220;church records&#8221; and over four hundred returns for &#8220;church \r\nhistory.&#8221;&#160; The catalog must be searched by town name in order to \r\nascertain which church records are available in either original volumes \r\nor abstracted format. Head librarian William Copley compiled a document \r\nin 1981 that lists the church records, mostly from the manuscript \r\ncollection, that are housed at Tuck Library. This document is part of \r\nthe inventory collection mentioned earlier, available through the LDS \r\nFamily History Centers. </p>\r\n<p>Some original records of the American Baptist Church relating to New \r\nHampshire towns have been voluntarily placed at the <a href=\"http://www.crds.edu/abhs/whoisabhs.htm\" target=\"new\">American \r\nBaptist-Samuel Colgate Historical Library </a>(1106 South Goodman St. \r\nRochester, New York 14620-2532, tel./fax: [716] 473-1740).

But, if you had ancestors who lived in New Hampshire at any \r\ntime from its colonial beginnings to its years of early statehood, \r\nchances are excellent that you will find information about one or more \r\nof those individuals in this series. </p>\r\n<p>The <em>New\r\n Hampshire Genealogical Research Guide </em>(Heritage Books, Inc., 1983),\r\n by Laird C. Towle and Ann N. Brown, lists the contents of each book in \r\nthe New Hampshire Provincial and State Papers with the exception of \r\nvolumes thirty-four to thirty-nine, which are devoted exclusively to \r\nprobate records. In their preface Towle and Brown note, &#8220;Each volume has\r\n a detailed index which generally cites all persons mentioned as well as\r\n all localities and topics. Browsing will disclose that many apparently \r\nperfunctory records contain fascinating genealogical data.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Volumes One to Ten<br></strong>The first seven volumes \r\nconsist of provincial papers from 1623 to 1776; volume eight contains \r\nstate papers from 1776 to 1783; volume nine contains miscellaneous town \r\npapers; and volume ten consists of provincial and state papers from 1749\r\n to 1792. Collectively these volumes present a potpourri of information \r\nmore valuable to those who are interested in the early history of New \r\nHampshire than to researchers seeking genealogical facts about the \r\ncolony&#8217;s residents.&#160; However, in the first volume I discovered an entry \r\nverifying my grandfather&#8217;s claim that our ancestor, David Thompson, was \r\nin the Piscataqua area by 1623, and shortly thereafter moved to Boston \r\nwhere he settled on a piece of water bound real estate known to this day\r\n as Thompson Island. This revelation was significant to me because in \r\ntrying to validate the facts in the family history my grandfather \r\ncompiled, I decided early on that he relied as much on his own \r\nimagination as he did on proven documentation. </p>\r\n<p>In\r\n another instance serendipity rescued me in my search for an answer to a\r\n question a State Library patron had asked. Neither my colleagues nor I \r\nwere successful in our attempts to find the answer using tried and true \r\nresearch procedures. The answer to the question &#8220;What was the census of \r\n1786?&#8221; was found while casually leafing through volume ten.&#160; In 1786 the\r\n General Court of New Hampshire passed a resolution providing for the &#8220;&#8230;\r\n taking and reporting of the Number of Souls in the several Towns within\r\n this State.&#8221; The town of Alstead replied to this demand very \r\nsuccinctly, &#8220;We have numbered the people in this Town &amp; find there \r\nis 943 Encluding every age &amp; sex.&#8221;&#160; New London reported in somewhat \r\nmore detail, &#8220;&#8230; forty-six males 21 and upord&#160; [upward], sixty-six males \r\nunder 21, thirty-nine feemales 18 and upord, sixty-one feemales under \r\n18.&#8221; In contrast, Peterborough Slip supplied the names of each of the \r\ntown&#8217;s thirty-four family heads and the number of members in each \r\nhousehold.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Volumes Eleven to Thirteen<br></strong>These\r\n volumes contain town papers of New Hampshire, with the towns arranged \r\nin alphabetical order. Each town&#8217;s opening entry reports information \r\nabout its original settlement.&#160; The chapter devoted to Deering begins by\r\n noting that it was originally the northern section of an area called \r\nSociety Land. The first settler was Alexander Robinson who arrived in \r\n1765, soon followed by William McKean, Francis Grimes, and others.&#160; In \r\nresponse to the inhabitants&#8217; petition in 1774 to charter their section \r\nof Society Land, Governor John Wentworth officially named the town \r\nDeering, in honor of his wife, Frances Deering.&#160; In&#160; 1772, when \r\nWentworth chartered the southern section of Society Land in response to a\r\n petition of its inhabitants, he named it Francestown.</p>\r\n<p class=\"DefaultText\">With a single exception, the nature of the \r\nadditional items of information in these volumes varies considerably. \r\nThat lone exception is the listing of facts about the townsmen who \r\nserved during the Revolutionary War, which state the units of which they\r\n were members, whether or not they were injured or died in the service, \r\ntheir dates of enlistment and discharge, and miscellaneous information. \r\nFor example, it was noted in the Weare town papers that Ebenezer \r\nSinclear was killed during the Battle of Saratoga, leaving a destitute \r\nwidow and three small children.</p>\r\n<p class=\"DefaultText\"><strong>Volumes \r\nFourteen to Seventeen<br></strong>The four volumes that receive the greatest \r\nuse, especially among patrons wishing to apply for Daughters of the \r\nAmerican Revolution (DAR) or Sons of the American Revolution (SAR) \r\nmembership, are volumes fourteen through seventeen, entitled \r\n&#8220;Revolutionary War Rolls.&#8221;&#160; Within the series itself they are called&#160; \r\n&#8220;War Rolls, Volumes 1&#8221; through&#160; &#8220;War Rolls, Volume 4.&#8221;&#160; New Hampshire \r\nState Archivist Dr. Frank Mevers&#160; has compiled a very helpful every name\r\n index to this four-volume set.&#160; The War Rolls are also available on \r\nmicrofilm, microfiche, and CD-ROM. Isaac Hammond, who edited the War \r\nRolls, commented, &#8220;They will be of great value to town historians, \r\ngenealogists, and others tracing the history of their ancestors.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>Historians who are interested in campaigns that \r\noccurred during the Revolutionary War period will find relevant \r\ninformation in these volumes. Volume fourteen, for example, includes an \r\narticle by the editor entitled &#8220;New Hampshire Troops in the Qu&#233;bec \r\nExpedition,&#8221; which describes the planning for the campaign, the \r\nagonizing hardships encountered during the winter expedition from \r\nCambridge to Qu&#233;bec City, and the role New Hampshire men played in this \r\nvaliant but unsuccessful action.</p>\r\n<p>Another \r\naccount of historical relevance in this series is a transcript entitled \r\n&#8220;Diary of Lieutenant Jonathan Burton While in the Canada Expedition from\r\n Aug. 1, 1776, to Nov. 29, 1776.&#8221; Burton&#8217;s account begins and ends at \r\nhis home in Wilton, New Hampshire. His company did not lose any lives in\r\n armed combat, but by November, outbreaks of smallpox, pneumonia, and \r\nother forms of illness killed or seriously impaired the health of more \r\nthan half of the sixty-seven men who embarked on the campaign as \r\nsoldiers in Lieutenant Burton&#8217;s company in August.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>It appears that all of the hundreds of rosters that \r\ncomprise the bulk of these four volumes include soldiers&#8217; names, the \r\nofficers under whom they served, and the dates of their service. Beyond \r\nthose three basic pieces of information the facts found from roster to \r\nroster vary considerably. The list of Captain Henry Dearborn&#8217;s company \r\nin Colonel Benedict Arnold&#8217;s detachment contains as much information as \r\nthe family historian can hope to find in any of these rosters.&#160; For \r\nexample, one entry in this company roster states that \r\ntwenty-one-year-old fifer Caleb Edson, from the town of Cockermouth, was\r\n a joiner [carpenter or cabinet maker] in civilian life.&#160;&#160; On September \r\n18, 1775, he received two months pay amounting to four pounds and eight \r\nshillings. The same roster reveals that twenty-seven-year-old Thomas \r\nTolley of Dover was a seaman, and twenty-two-year-old Thomas Holmes of \r\nDerry was a cordwainer [shoemaker].&#160; As scarce as the information may be\r\n in many of the lists in these four volumes, it is fortunate that the \r\nvast majority of rosters do provide the name of the unit in which a \r\npatriot served since this fact must be provided in order to obtain an \r\nancestor&#8217;s service record or pension record from the National Archives.<br><br><strong>Volumes\r\n Eighteen to Twenty-two<br></strong>Volume eighteen, titled &#8220;Miscellaneous \r\nProvincial and State Papers&#8221; (1725-1800); volume nineteen (provincial \r\npapers from 1679 to 1764); and volumes twenty to twenty-two (state \r\npapers from 1784 to 1793) are a continuation of volumes one to ten. \r\nThese papers contain an extensive collection of facts about early state \r\ncitizens such as the New Hampshire man for whom Bellows Falls, Vermont, \r\nwas named although he never lived in that state.</p>\r\n<p>The appendix in volume twenty-one contains fifty-eight\r\n brief biographies of leaders who have not received the full recognition\r\n they deserve for their contributions to New Hampshire&#8217;s early history. \r\nBenjamin Bellows of Walpole, for example, left an outstanding record of \r\nservice in many fields. As a result of his zealous support of the \r\nAmerican Revolution he eventually rose to the rank of major general. He \r\nheld many offices in Cheshire County including sheriff, registrar of \r\ndeeds, justice of the peace, representative to the State Legislature, \r\nand judge of the court of common pleas. At the state level he was an \r\nelector of the Vice President of the United States in 1789, 1792, 1796, \r\nand 1800.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Bellows&#8217; biography indicates that \r\nhis honesty and compassion cost him considerable sums of money early in \r\nhis career. As a merchant supplying provision to the town&#8217;s newest \r\nsettlers, he continued to accept payment in bills from newcomers to \r\nWalpole and others across the Connecticut River in Vermont long after \r\nthe value of paper money had depreciated.&#160;&#160; </p>\r\n<p>While\r\n the vast majority of entries in volumes eighteen to twenty-two do not \r\ncontain as much detail about most individuals as the account of Benjamin\r\n Bellows does, a search through the hundreds of names indexed in these \r\nvolumes may well reveal new information about an ancestor who lived in \r\nNew Hampshire prior to the nineteenth century.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Volume\r\n Twenty-three<br></strong>Volume twenty-three is titled &#8220;Documents in the \r\nPublic Record Office in London, England, Relating to the Province of New\r\n Hampshire, 1606<em>&#8211;</em> 1771.&#8221;&#160; Despite this imposing title, few facts \r\nof genealogical relevance will be found on its pages. Essentially it is a\r\n catalog of documents in the Public Records Office relating to New \r\nHampshire with only a single line for each entry.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Volumes Twenty-four to Twenty-nine<br></strong>Volumes \r\ntwenty-four and twenty-five make up &#8220;Town Charters,&#8221; which also has a \r\nsubset of volumes within the primary volumes. For example, both &#8220;Volume \r\nXXIV&#8221; and &#8220; Volume 1&#8221; are printed on the title page of the first book. \r\nIn the case of many towns these volumes include not only the listing of \r\nthe lot assigned to each settler, but a foldout map showing the location\r\n of each of those lots. According to volume twenty-seven, my ancestor \r\nJoshua Martin was assigned Lot 5 in Range 2 situated on the&#160; &#8220;so side&#8221; \r\nof the Piscatquog River. His brother, Nathaniel, was assigned Lot 3 in \r\nRange 9 on the &#8220;no side&#8221; of the &#8220;Piscataquog&#8221; River.&#160; By comparing the \r\nmap from volume twenty-seven with a current geodetic survey map, I have \r\nbeen able to pinpoint my ancestor&#8217;s original property.&#160; The Martin \r\nbrothers had to meet certain regulations in order to attain permanent \r\nownership of these lots: &#8220;Within one year of May 31, 1749, each Owner \r\nmust have a house Sixteen Foot Square with a Chimney and Cellar and Four\r\n Acres of land enclosed, cleared, &amp; fitted for mowing or Tillage.&#8221;&#160;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Volume Thirty<br></strong>Among the many features of\r\n volume thirty, &#8220;Revolutionary War Documents,&#8221; is the town-by-town \r\nroster of the 8,199 New Hampshire men who signed the Association Test \r\nand the 773 who refused to sign. The signers,&#160;&#160; &#8220;&#8230; solemnly promised \r\nthat they would to the utmost of their power and at the risk of their \r\nLives and Fortunes with ARMS oppose the hostile British Fleets and \r\nArmies, against the United American colonies.&#8221;&#160; Of the sixty-nine male \r\nresidents of the town of Dunbarton that were twenty-one years old or \r\nover, ten refused to sign [the roster excluded &#8220;lunaticks or Negroes&#8221;].&#160;\r\n At least three non-signers, William Stark and William and James \r\nStinson, joined the loyalist force as the war progressed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Volumes Thirty-one to Thirty-nine<br></strong>Volumes \r\nthirty-one to thirty-nine are made up entirely of probate records from \r\n1635 to 1771, and should be of particular interest to family historians \r\nwhose ancestors died in provincial New Hampshire. One of these records, \r\nhowever, illustrates the fact that no entry in the entire forty volumes \r\nis a primary source. This record is in the printed will of Scotsman \r\nArchibald Stark, who died in 1758. The will lists a son of Archibald \r\nnamed Henry.&#160; Since few if any Scottish children were named Henry in the\r\n eighteenth century I suspected the will had been transcribed \r\nincorrectly. My examination of Archibald Stark&#8217;s handwritten will at the\r\n New Hampshire State Archives shows very clearly that between the \r\noriginal document and the printed page Anna became Henry.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Volume Forty</strong><br>Judging by the entries in this \r\nvolume, which includes court records from 1640 to 1692 and court papers \r\nfrom 1632 to 1668, seventeenth-century society was just as litigious as \r\ntoday&#8217;s society. In addition to citing scores of cases involving suits \r\nthat plaintiffs brought against relatives, neighbors, and others, and \r\ncases the town brought against its residents, this volume also \r\nillustrates the fact that colonial punishment could be very inhumane. \r\nBeing a Quaker was a crime. Thus, &#8220;The Court Lookes upon Edward Wharton \r\nas a vagabond Quaker &amp; Sentence him to be Conveighed from Con&#173;stable\r\n to Constable untill he Coms to Salem ye place of his habi&#173;tacon &amp; \r\nthat he be whipt through Dover hampton &amp; Newbery by the Constables \r\nOf said Townes at ye Carts tayle [tail] to ye Number Of 30 stripes, viz,\r\n tenn stripes in each Towne.&#160; 4<sup>th</sup> July, 1663.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Where to Find the New Hampshire Provincial and \r\nState Papers</strong><br>Every town and city in the state received a copy of \r\neach volume of the New Hampshire Provincial and State Papers as soon as \r\nthey came off the presses.&#160; Over the years these sets disappeared from \r\nsmaller libraries for lack of shelf space. Currently the researcher will\r\n find these volumes at the New Hampshire State Library, the Tuck Library\r\n at the New Hampshire Historical Society, and the New Hampshire State \r\nArchives. They are also available at the New England Historic and \r\nGenealogical Society, academic libraries, and no doubt in many libraries\r\n and other repositories housing large historical collections.</p>\r\n</div></div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/new-hampshire-provincial-and-state-papers/", "published": "", "id": 339}, {"author": "Sherry L.

This is part one of a \r\ncomprehensive list of New Hampshire town and county developments over \r\ntime. Initially, New Hampshire was initially one province with an \r\nindividual town government. In 1769, an act proposing the establishment \r\nof five counties to handle growing demand on government administration \r\nwas sent to England for confirmation. The Crown confirmed the act in \r\n1771 and the new system was established a year later. </p>\r\n<p>What follows are descriptions of each of the first five counties, \r\noriginal boundaries, and the towns founded within those bounds. Each \r\ntown list includes: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The name of town with the date it was adopted </li>\r\n<li>All known previous names and date name was adopted, when known </li>\r\n<li>Date of town grant or incorporation </li>\r\n<li>Parent town set off from, when applicable and known </li>\r\n<li>Date settled </li>\r\n<li>Date of affiliation with county or counties </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All information in this article regarding the formation of counties, \r\ntheir bounds, the towns in each county with dates, and county seats is \r\ntaken from the preface of Otis G. Hammond, ed. <em>Probate Records of the\r\n Province of New Hampshire</em> vol. 39, State Paper Series (State of New\r\n Hampshire: 1941), viii. For a statewide alphabetical list of New \r\nHampshire town names see this volume. Also Isaac W. Hammond, ed. <em>Town\r\n Papers, Documents Relating to Towns in New Hampshire</em> vol. 6-8, \r\nState Paper Series (Concord, NH, Parsons B. Cogswell, State Printer: \r\n1891) was used to obtain information about former names and dates of \r\nsettlement. When information from these sources conflicted, or dates of \r\nsettlement were missing, various town histories were consulted. In \r\naddition a list of old town names arranged alphabetically found in the \r\nNew Hampshire Vital Record office, Hazen Drive, Concord, NH, was \r\nincorporated. This list is not sourced and when information from the \r\nlist conflicted with the State Papers series, or did not make sense, it \r\nwas not used. <br><br>Part two of this article will cover later counties\r\n and associated towns. </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://co.rockingham.nh.us/\" target=\"new\"><strong>Rockingham\r\n County </strong></a>was one of the first five counties established \r\nunder the act of 1769. Its boundaries were then from the mouth of the \r\nPiscataqua River, along the river up to the easterly corner of New \r\nMarket, then northwesterly by Nottingham, Chichester, and Canterbury to \r\nthe Merrimack River, down the river to the westerly lines of Bow, \r\nConcord, and Pembroke, following the river again to the northwest corner\r\n of Derryfield (Manchester), then by the easterly lines of Derryfield, \r\nLitchfield, and Nottingham West (Hudson) to the province line first \r\nmentioned, including the Isles of Shoals belonging to this province. \r\nRockingham County records are

Part one of this list covered the first five counties \r\nestablished in the state: Rockingham, Strafford, Hillsborough, Chesire, \r\nand Grafton. Initially, New Hampshire was one province with an \r\nindividual town government. In 1769, an act proposing the establishment \r\nof five counties to handle growing demand on government administration \r\nwas sent to England for confirmation. The Crown confirmed the act in \r\n1771 and the new system was established a year later. </p>\r\n<p>What \r\nfollows are descriptions of the remaining counties, their original \r\nboundaries, and the towns founded within those bounds.

For a statewide alphabetical list of New Hampshire town \r\nnames see this volume. Also Isaac W. Hammond, ed. <em>Town Papers, \r\nDocuments Relating to Towns in New Hampshire</em> vol. 6-8, State Paper \r\nSeries (Concord, NH, Parsons B. Cogswell, State Printer: 1891) was used \r\nto obtain information about former names and dates of settlement. When \r\ninformation from these sources conflicted, or dates of settlement were \r\nmissing, various town histories were consulted. In addition, a list of \r\nold town names found in the New Hampshire Vital Record office, Hazen \r\nDrive, Concord, NH, was incorporated.

This article will focus on research aids, library \r\nmaterials, and exemplary works to assist in the search for New Hampshire\r\n ancestors. The next installment in this series will show which New \r\nHampshire towns have published histories, identify those histories which\r\n include genealogies, and indicate those that are currently available \r\nfor sale (with purchase information and cost). It will also be noted if \r\nthe histories are available to NEHGS members via the Society&#8217;s \r\ncirculating and research libraries. </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>William Copeley, head librarian at the New Hampshire Historical \r\nSociety&#8217;s Tuck Library, said it well in the introduction to his recent \r\nwork on genealogies in New Hampshire town histories (see below): &#8220;Town \r\nhistories are undoubtedly the single most useful, widely available \r\nsource for research on New Hampshire families. Among all the states of \r\nthe Union, New Hampshire is almost uniquely well represented by detailed\r\n town histories. In the absence of annotated bibliographies of the \r\nhistory of each state, it is impossible to prove this statement \r\nscientifically, but most genealogists and historians who have had an \r\nopportunity to compare printed New Hampshire sources with those of other\r\n states would probably agree.&#8221; It is prudent to check these sources \r\nbefore heading off to reinvent the wheel (or chart as the case may be). \r\nIf you are one of the many fortunate descendants of a New Hampshire \r\nfamily who has been covered in these resources you will want to see what\r\n other researchers have found before setting off in the rough world of \r\nprimary sources. Ask a librarian at one of the repositories listed below\r\n for information regarding the reliability of the history or genealogy. \r\nArmed with these important finds you will then want to go to primary \r\nsources to check the validity of unsourced data. </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li><a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.nhhistory.org/library.html\">Tuck \r\nLibrary </a>, located on 30 Park St. in Concord, is acknowledged as \r\nholding the largest collection of New Hampshire town histories anywhere.\r\n Their brochure boasts about 2,000 state, county, and town histories. In\r\n addition they have about 5,000 family genealogies, many of which are \r\nunpublished. </li>\r\n<li><a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/nhsl/index.html\">The \r\nNew Hampshire State Library </a>, on the next block at 20 Park St., also\r\n has an impressive town history collection. They have approximately \r\n2,400 published family histories, some of which are not found in the \r\nTuck Library collection. </li>\r\n<li><a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.manchester.lib.nh.us/\">The \r\nManchester City Library&#8217;s </a>large town and county history collection \r\nis kept in its New Hampshire Room. Newspaper clippings for each town \r\nsupplement these histories. The library is located on 405 Pine Street in\r\n Manchester. </li>\r\n<li>Baker Library at Dartmouth College in Hanover has a considerable \r\nhistory collection covering the towns surrounding Hanover and beyond. </li>\r\n<li>The New England Historic and Genealogical Society Library in Boston \r\nis another excellent place to find both New Hampshire town histories and\r\n genealogies of families that lived in the state. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Many other libraries across the state have collections of varying \r\ndegrees. </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>The better part of New Hampshire town histories were written between \r\nthe latter half of the nineteenth century and the early twentieth \r\ncentury. Many included family histories, and others provided family \r\ntables or early vital records to assist in tracing the families who \r\nresided in the town. Bill Copeley states in the index cited below that \r\nhe consulted 348 histories from 202 towns published through 1999, all \r\nfound at Tuck Library. He found that only 32 towns, predominantly those \r\nwith very small populations, did not have a town history. </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Some of the towns that did not have their records preserved and \r\nprinted in the earlier years have had various historians and \r\ngenealogists complete works in more contemporary times. The bicentennial\r\n of our nation in 1976 inspired a new crop of histories. With the new \r\nmillennium there appears to be yet another resurgence of genealogical \r\nworks in print. A few examples of more recent works in the town history \r\nand town-wide genealogy arena are: </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>Two hundred plus, Bradford, New Hampshire in retrospect</em>, by \r\nthe History Committee and Bicentennial Committee (Phoenix Publishing, \r\n1976) </li>\r\n<li><em>Hollis Family Album </em>by Joan Child Tinklepaugh (Penobscot \r\nPress, 1997) </li>\r\n<li><em>Early Families of Unity, N.H., and Cemeteries of Unity, N.H.</em> \r\nby Kathleen C. Beals (the author, Albany, CA, 1997).&#160; </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Genealogies of many New Hampshire families have been produced over \r\nthe years and continue to be today. The four-volume set by historian and\r\n genealogist Ezra S. Sterns, <em>Genealogical and Family History of the \r\nState of New Hampshire</em> (Lewis Publishing Company, 1908), covers New \r\nHampshire&#8217;s noted families. Although most of these early works did not \r\ninclude source information, today&#8217;s published genealogies are much more \r\nlikely to include citations, allowing the researcher to better evaluate \r\nthe information contained. A few standouts among recent New Hampshire \r\ngenealogies are listed below: </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ann Theopold Chaplin, <em>The Babson Genealogy</em> (Gateway Press, \r\n1997). </li>\r\n<li>David Watson Kruger, <em>Jonathan Watson (1650?-1714) of Dover, New \r\nHampshire: who settled there by 1672</em> (Newbury Street Press, 1998). </li>\r\n<li>Dean Crawford Smith, ed. by Melinde Lutz Sanborn, <em>The Ancestry \r\nof Samuel Blanchard Ordway, 1844&#8211;1916</em> (New England Historic \r\nGenealogical Society, 1990). </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>There are several aids to help the researcher locate family records \r\nin town histories and/or printed genealogies. The earliest are the \r\ncompanion volumes: <em>Munsell&#8217;s American Genealogist</em> (fifth edition,\r\n Joel Munsell, Albany, NY, 1900) and <em>Munsell&#8217;s Genealogical Index</em>\r\n (fifth edition, Joel Munsell, Albany, NY, 1900). The first work gives \r\nthe genealogies in print on each family arranged alphabetically under \r\nthe surname. The second work is arranged the same way and lists all \r\npublications containing family histories of at least three generations. \r\nThese volumes give sources beyond the state of New Hampshire, but also \r\ninclude New Hampshire town histories. The former is available in the <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.library.unh.edu/\">Dimond Library </a>at \r\nthe University of New Hampshire in Durham. The latter is available at \r\nthe <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/nhsl/index.html\">New \r\nHampshire State Library </a>in Concord and the NEHGS Library in Boston. \r\nThough these volumes were written at an early date, many of the works \r\ncited are those we use today in tracing New Hampshire family roots. </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Another helpful volume is <em>Hammond&#8217;s Check List of New Hampshire \r\nHistory</em> (New Hampshire Historical Society, 1925; reprinted New \r\nHampshire Publishing Co, 1971). It includes all historical works for \r\neach town including books, articles, and pamphlets. The town names are \r\narranged alphabetically. Although this book does not identify which \r\nmaterials contain genealogical information, it is a valuable research \r\ntool when used in conjunction with the other works cited in this \r\narticle. This book is available at Tuck Library, New Hampshire State \r\nLibrary and the NEHGS Library. Topic areas covered in <em>Hammond&#8217;s Check\r\n List</em> include: </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Biography </li>\r\n<li>Boundaries </li>\r\n<li>Constitution </li>\r\n<li>Counties </li>\r\n<li>General </li>\r\n<li>Military </li>\r\n<li>Regimental </li>\r\n<li>New Hampshire grants &#8211; Now Vermont </li>\r\n<li>Religious </li>\r\n<li>White Mountains </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Elmer M. Hunt published <em>Families&#8217; Names in New Hampshire Town \r\nHistories</em> in the <em>Historical New Hampshire</em> magazine<em> </em>(New\r\n Hampshire Historical Society, Dec 1946). This served as a general \r\nsurname index to New Hampshire town histories for many years. As the \r\npublication has been out of print for some time, New Hampshire \r\nresearchers can now turn to William Copeley&#8217;s <em>Index to Genealogies \r\nin New Hampshire Town Histories</em>&#160; (New Hampshire Historical Society,\r\n 1988, with a revised and enlarged edition released in 2000). He used a \r\nminimum of three generations through a male or female line as a guide to\r\n determine which names were included. The names are listed \r\nalphabetically by surname, much in the same format as the predecessor. \r\nFollowing each surname is a list of New Hampshire town names, referring \r\nto the town history of that name which holds the genealogical record for\r\n the family. </p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>A list of top New Hampshire town histories and genealogies is \r\ncurrently being developed through an informal polling of top \r\ngenealogists and historians in the state and beyond. The results will be\r\n included in the second part of this article. </p>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/new-hampshire-town-histories-and-genealogies/", "published": "", "id": 342}, {"author": "Sherry L.

At a time when many of our towns are reeling from \r\nastronomical growth, it is clear that the history of our town is still a\r\n very important matter to New Hampshireites. </p>\r\n<p>Each town handles the sales of their histories in their own way. The \r\ntown clerk is always my first contact for information about histories of\r\n a specific town. In many cases, the clerk will have histories available\r\n for purchase, but if not, they can direct you to someone who does. As \r\ngenealogists, we all know how important these folks are when searching \r\nfor important birth, marriage, and death information. I have found the \r\nclerks I spoke with to be very helpful and courteous, although more than\r\n one expressed their displeasure about genealogists&#8217; frequent propensity\r\n of sharing the entire history of their ancestors! It is a point well \r\ntaken; they have their work to do.

This first installment \r\nwill include all town names that start with A to F. The next section \r\nwill include all towns that begin with G to M, and the third part will \r\nconclude with the remainder of New Hampshire towns. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>The following information on the histories for each town is included:\r\n town name; date of original printing/date of subsequent editions; \r\ntitle; genealogies (yes or no); index (primarily yes or no, although if \r\nthe index is in the reprint and not in the original it is so noted, also\r\n if the index is specific [i.e. places, names, etc] rather than a \r\ngeneral index the type is listed); author; available from (includes \r\nwhere the volume may be purchased and as much contact information as was\r\n possible to obtain &#8212; it is imperative that would-be buyers make contact\r\n to determine method of payment and any applicable shipping charges in \r\nadvance of placing an order); cost (this represents the cost of the book\r\n and does not include any applicable shipping charges); NEHGS Loan \r\n(indicates whether the volume is available for loan to NEHGS members \r\nthrough the circulating library &#8212; yes or no); and NEHGS Research Library\r\n (indicates whether the volume is available at the NEHGS Research \r\nLibrary in Boston - yes or no). </p>\r\n<p>I used the following&#160;methodology to collect the data:</p>\r\n<p>&#8226; I \r\nbegan with a list of all towns in New Hampshire.</p>\r\n<p>&#8226; Next I looked at William Copeley's <em>Index to Genealogies in New \r\nHampshire Town Histories</em> to identify the towns that have a published\r\n history with genealogies. I then searched the New Hampshire Historical \r\nSociety's Tuck Library catalog online to try to determine which \r\nhistories Bill had referenced in his index based on their listing as \r\nboth history and genealogy for the given town. The list was then sent to\r\n the Tuck Library for review and a follow up visit finalized the \r\nselections.</p>\r\n<p>&#8226; I then made contact with town offices, historical societies, and/or\r\n libraries in each town to learn about reprints and sales data for the \r\nchosen histories. </p>\r\n<p>&#8226; Next I went to the Higginson Books website and took information \r\nfrom their online sales page for towns that indicated their histories \r\nwere not in reprint or not available and towns where I had not been able\r\n to reach anyone. </p>\r\n<p>&#8226; Finally I searched the NEHGS online catalog and online store to \r\ndetermine which volumes were available to view at their research library\r\n in Boston, to borrow through their circulating library service, and to \r\npurchase via their online store at <em>www.NewEnglandAncestors.org</em>.</p>\r\n<p>I hope these results are as helpful to the genealogical community as \r\nthey have been fun to collect!<br><br><strong>&#160;</strong></p>\r\n<hr width=\"100%\" height=\"1\">\r\n<p><strong>New Hampshire Town Histories Chart </strong></p>\r\n<hr width=\"100%\" height=\"1\">\r\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\r\n<table width=\"550\" height=\"8343\" border=\"1\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"9%\"><strong>Town</strong></td>\r\n<td width=\"7%\"><strong>Date of Orig.

Each card contains a single event. The cards are filed in\r\n row upon row of oak filing drawers. To access information, the \r\nresearcher must look up the drawer location of the record on a finding \r\nchart. The filing system is unique and usually confuses the uninitiated.\r\n Records are filed according to the first and third letter of the \r\nsurname. The researcher must submit a request slip with the name sought \r\nand the drawer number to the volunteer in charge of the research room. \r\nThe volunteer then retrieves the file drawer and selects a group of \r\ncards, which should include the desired record. Since the research room \r\nis staffed by volunteers from the New Hampshire Society of Genealogists,\r\n the vault room is not open to the public if a volunteer is unavailable.\r\n Fortunately, this has occurred very rarely in recent years. <br><br>There\r\n is some danger in this system of records being misfiled or even lost \r\nafter use. But many times the researcher finds previously unknown \r\ninformation about the family. Because the cards are filed in this unique\r\n manner, the researcher has to keep in mind that the name they are \r\nseeking may be filed under a different, or in the case of the large \r\nFrench-Canadian population in the state, Anglicized spelling. Marriage \r\nrecords are filed according to the groom's last name in the master \r\nfiles. There is no similar record filed according to the bride's last \r\nname. There is, however, a bride's list on microtext, which is readily \r\navailable in the Search Room. These cards contain the same information \r\nas that which is on the grooms' cards but are filed according to brides'\r\n last name. <br><br>The restricted access vault contains the more recent\r\n records, which are stored in volumes. In order to gain access or get a \r\ncopy of a record, a researcher has to demonstrate relationship to the \r\nperson whose record is sought. New Hampshire has been using an interim \r\ncomputerized system for about two years in 120 of the state's 234 towns.\r\n When someone requested a certified copy of a family record, a clerk \r\nwould look up the paper record, key the information into a computer, and\r\n then print out a copy. <br><br>Recently the New Hampshire Bureau of \r\nVital Records and Health Statistics became the first state in the \r\ncountry to replace its paper system of recording births, deaths, and \r\nmarriages, so-called vital records, with a computerized database and \r\nimaging system. New Hampshire now possesses the first state-of-the-art \r\nsystem in the country for vital record retention and accumulation. The \r\nnew system makes it possible for researchers to obtain copies of these \r\nrecords at local town or city clerk's office instead of having to travel\r\n to Concord or the city where the events originally were recorded. State\r\n officials realized they weren't taking full advantage of technology. <br><br>Getting\r\n the system in place meant changing some laws. For instance, electronic \r\nsignatures had to be allowed to stand in for hand signing, and the \r\nrequirement that records be stored itat the local levels had to be \r\namended. Computerizing the system begins to solve another looming \r\nproblem: local officials have been running out of space to store \r\nrecords. The State Vital Records division, for example, was running out \r\nof room in the confidential records vault, where recent records are \r\nkept. All new records will be kept on computer instead of on the shelves\r\n and file cabinets that line the current vault. As funds permit, older \r\nrecords will be entered into the database. <br><br>As of the fall of \r\n1998, the system was up and running in six pilot communities: Concord, \r\nKeene, Nashua, Exeter, Dover, and Littleton. Hospitals, funeral \r\ndirectors, and town clerks in these communities have been filing vital \r\nrecords electronically. The information is then transmitted either by \r\nmodem or via an internet server to Concord. As for the rest of the \r\nstate, everything depends on the budget. It is expected that the state \r\nwill be able to fund 25 to 50 new municipal installations a year. \r\nInformation retrieval has now been simplified. Once the records are \r\nstored in the database, a clerk need only type in the requested record \r\nand the information appears on the screen, ready to be printed out. The \r\nresulting copy is neat, accurate, and virtually indistinguishable from a\r\n typed copy.", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/new-hampshire-resources-for-vital-records/", "published": "", "id": 345}, {"author": "Sherry L. Gould", "country": "New Hampshire", "title": "New Happenings at New Hampshire Vital Records", "content": "<p>&#160;Changes and new developments at New Hampshire Vital Records are \r\nnoteworthy to the genealogical community. In December 1999, John Fipphen\r\n wrote an article for this website entitled &#8220; <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&amp;ItemID=16071&amp;libID=16077\" title=\"New  Hampshire: Resources for Vital Records\">New  Hampshire: Resources for Vital Records</a>,&#8221; which outlined the state \r\nof affairs for vital records collection and access in New Hampshire. \r\nInformation regarding the history of vital record gathering and \r\nretention in the state is contained in that article and will not be \r\nrepeated here. This article will outline exciting new changes affecting \r\nthe public&#8217;s access to records held by the New Hampshire Department of \r\nHealth and Human Services, Office of Community &amp; Public Health, <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.dhhs.state.nh.us/DHHS/BVR/default.htm\">Bureau\r\n of Vital Records </a>, 6 Hazen Drive, Concord, NH 03301-6527. (Note the\r\n new title of the bureau&#8217;s oversight.) <br><br><strong>The Basics</strong></p>\r\n<p>The first change has to do with volunteer staffing of the open access\r\n research room. Volunteers come from a wide range of specialties across \r\nthe state. They include professional genealogical researchers, \r\nprofessors of history, experienced family researchers, and members of \r\nthe New Hampshire Society of Genealogists. Previously the research room \r\nwould close if there were no volunteers available to assist patrons on \r\nthat day. Now, if for some reason a volunteer is not available, the \r\nstaff of the vital records bureau covers the research room, enabling \r\npublic access every day the state office is open. (A list of <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://admin.state.nh.us/personnel/cba/article9.htm\">state\r\n holidays </a>is available online. The holidays are negotiated every two\r\n years as part of the collective bargaining agreement and are subject to\r\n change, so be sure to check before traveling any distance on a possible\r\n state holiday.) </p>\r\n<p><a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.dhhs.state.nh.us/DHHS/BVR/CONTACT+INFO/default.htm\">Hours of operation </a>have broadened and are currently \r\n8:15 to 11:45 a.m. and 12:15 to 4:15 p.m. Monday through Friday, except \r\non Wednesday when it closes at 3:30 p.m. for cleaning. The room is \r\nclosed for lunch each day from 11:45 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. It is important \r\nto understand that the closing time means the doors close and \r\nresearchers need to leave. However, if after hours of searching you have\r\n just found your ancestors when closing time approaches, do not hesitate\r\n to ask the volunteer for staff assistance to get your information. The \r\nstaff is very accommodating under these circumstances and will work with\r\n the public. </p>\r\n<p>As Mr. Fipphen outlined in his article, the unique system used to \r\nfile the open records is challenging to those who are unfamiliar with \r\nit. This system, which files individuals according to the first and \r\nthird letter of the surname, has confounded many researchers, especially\r\n those using the microfilmed records in sites other than the state \r\noffice. That was the purpose of the design for the system when the \r\nrecords were confidential. Now that the records are open to the public, \r\nmany researchers view the system as an impediment in locating the \r\ninformation they seek. New Hampshire State Registrar William Bolton has \r\nannounced his intent to alphabetize the open records, and this \r\ninitiative has received the support of State Archivist Frank Mevers. To \r\naccomplish this task, a new staff position has been added to the \r\ngenealogical research room to initiate the alphabetizing project and \r\nassist the volunteers with research requests from the public.&#160; Research \r\nroom volunteers may also assist in the alphabetizing effort, as time \r\npermits. </p>\r\n<strong>New Records Added</strong><p>A long awaited change is the release of new records to the open \r\naccess research room. Previously researchers could freely search for \r\nbirth records prior to 1901, marriages from 1640 through 1938, and \r\ndivorces from the earliest on record through 1938. Throughout 2002 the \r\nbureau released marriage, divorce, and death records covering the period\r\n between 1939-1948. Such records from 1949 to present remain restricted \r\nand <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.dhhs.state.nh.us/DHHS/BVR/ELIGIBILITY/default.htm\">eligibility</a>to access them is granted only to those who \r\nhave a &#8220; <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/X/126/126-14.htm\">direct and tangible interest </a>&#8221; in the information. (For\r\n a complete review of New Hampshire <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.dhhs.state.nh.us/DHHS/BVR/LAWS-RULES-POLICIES/default.htm\">laws, rules, and policies </a>regarding vital records, see\r\n the Bureau of Vital Records website.) </p>\r\n<p>A researcher may obtain an uncertified copy of any open access record\r\n for a fifty-cent fee. Certified copies are currently $12, whether they \r\nare from the open or restricted records. Copies from the restricted \r\nrecords are only available as certified copies. </p>\r\n<p>LDS church representatives have just completed filming these newly \r\nreleased records, which should be available on microfilm in the near \r\nfuture. </p>\r\n<strong>Technological Advances</strong><p>New Hampshire has continued to build on new technologies in state \r\ngovernment. This is evident in the way the bureau does business \r\nincluding: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The option to fax requests for vital record copies with <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.dhhs.state.nh.us/DHHS/BVR/FAQs/default.htm#1\">credit card payment options </a></li>\r\n<li>One hundred fifty towns currently submit vital records \r\nelectronically to the bureau. </li>\r\n<li>Computer replacement project for all participating towns in 2003 </li>\r\n<li>New Web-enabled software for towns, cities, hospitals, funeral \r\nhomes, and certifying physicians will allow greater participation in \r\nelectronic submission. January 2004 is the rollout date, the vendor just\r\n having been awarded a contract. </li>\r\n<li>Laptop outlets will be added in the genealogical research room. The \r\nwork order has been submitted and scheduling is just a matter of time. </li>\r\n<li>Images of open records are coming online! </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The staff of the bureau has long been committed to getting the event \r\ncards in the research room scanned. Finding the time and money for the \r\nproject has been the major obstacle in completing this goal. Noel Barton\r\n from the LDS Family History Library recently announced that New \r\nHampshire has been selected as the third state behind Ohio and Kentucky \r\nto have their record images digitized. New Hampshire approved the \r\nproject without hesitation. LDS project manager Brent Peterson is so \r\nmotivating that State Registrar Bill Bolton, volunteered to index some \r\nrecords personally. </p>\r\n<p>The state must now make a decision on where to host the images, and \r\nwill tackle that choice in the near future. Two choices are the LDS \r\nwebsite or the State of New Hampshire website and Mr. Bolton has \r\nindicated that there are pros and cons to each choice. </p>\r\n<p>The date targeted for completion of the project has not been \r\ndetermined. Indexing of New Hampshire records has taken a back seat to \r\nEastern European record projects at this time. The most recent status \r\nreport as of August 31, 2002, indicated that 51.72 percent of the \r\n2,025,235 New Hampshire records have been assigned and 1.07 percent has \r\nbeen submitted. </p>\r\n<p>We will all anxiously await the completion of this exciting project! \r\nMuch of the information given in this article will become obsolete to \r\nmany researchers when the images are available online to search from the\r\n comfort of your own home or local library. But until then, this update \r\nshould add to your successes in searching for New Hampshire ancestors. </p>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/new-happenings-at-new-hampshire-vital-records/", "published": "", "id": 346}, {"author": "Sherry L. Gould ", "country": "New Hampshire", "title": "Researching Court Records in New Hampshire", "content": "<p>Court records can offer an abundance of information to assist \r\nthe family historian. The type of court records you may expect to find are \r\ncivil, criminal, or probate. Ancestors may appear in these records as \r\ndefendants, plaintiffs, jurors, or witnesses. They may have been appointed by \r\nthe court to take an inventory of an estate, or they may have had their own \r\nestate inventoried. They may have been involved in cases concerning divorce, \r\nadoption, guardianship, and deed disputes, or have been appointed to public \r\noffice. These records fill in details of an ancestor&#8217;s life that may not be \r\navailable through any other source. They can identify the location of an \r\nindividual or their occupation and sometimes help determine relationships. The \r\nabsence of court records tells a story about an ancestor as well. Of course it \r\ntakes a search to determine whether court records exist for an individual or \r\nnot. How to go about that search is the purpose of this article. As with other \r\ngenealogical pursuits, a brief history of New Hampshire courts will be helpful \r\nin knowing where to look for your ancestral stories. \r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>From early times each community had appointed one or more justice of the \r\npeace. They had authority over minor civil and legal matters in the community, \r\nand often kept records of the matters that came before them. Some of these \r\nrecord books have survived and are kept in libraries, historical societies, and \r\nprivate collections. </p>\r\n<p>The story of courts in New Hampshire begins with the relationship that early \r\nresidents had with the crown. The four original towns were Dover, Exeter, \r\nHampton, and Portsmouth, all easily accessible by water. Permanent settlement of \r\nEuropeans (men who were primarily either members of the Anglican Church or \r\nnon-religious) began in 1623, eleven years prior to the Charter given the \r\nMassachusetts Puritans. The settlers were fishermen, trappers, and lumbermen. \r\nEach town developed independent forms of government, and thus courts, before the \r\nincursions of the Puritans desiring to rule New England. Mr. John M. Shirley, an \r\neminent New Hampshire lawyer in 1883, observed that, &#8220;in the just sense of the \r\nterm, the genuine township system originated and was developed in New \r\nHampshire.&#8221;[1] Each town chose a judge and associates to serve their community \r\nby preserving justice. An examination of cases heard and judgments rendered has \r\ncaused learned men to conclude that these courts worked remarkably well, given \r\nthat they were the first and last resort for their citizens.[2] This system was \r\nable to sustain much political upheaval through 1769, the details of which go \r\nbeyond the scope of this article and can be found in numerous places.</p>\r\n<p>The provincial secretary kept court records during the provincial period \r\nthrough 1772. In 1776 these records were maintained with Rockingham County \r\nrecords and were removed from Portsmouth to Exeter due to the risk of attack on \r\nPortsmouth during the Revolutionary War.[3] In 1891 they were transferred to the \r\nSecretary of State in Concord.[4] Today they are housed at the <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.state.nh.us/state/index.html\">New Hampshire State \r\nArchives</a> (located on 71 South Fruit Street in Concord, NH 03301, hereinafter \r\n&#8220;archives&#8221;). </p>\r\n<p>It is essential to determine the county affiliation of an individual&#8217;s \r\nresidence to locate most New Hampshire court records after 1772. Town names have \r\nchanged in many instances and some towns have had multiple county affiliations \r\nthrough the years. See my previous articles, &#8220;New Hampshire Town and County \r\nDevelopment&#8221; <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/research/services/articles_newhampshire_town_county.asp\">part 1</a> and \r\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/research/services/articles_newhampshire_town_county2.asp\">part 2</a> \r\nto determine which county held the records for a given town at a given time. \r\nTowns are listed by their current name under their current county affiliation \r\nwith previous names and county affiliations also listed. At the county level, \r\nthe Inferior Court of Common Pleas adjudicated probate and civil cases, and the \r\nCourt of General Quarter Sessions of the Peace heard criminal cases. The \r\nSuperior Court of Judicature met twice a year in each country to consider \r\nappeals for all types of cases.[5] The General Court and the Governor and \r\nExecutive Council had constituted the final courts of appeal prior to 1776. The \r\nSupreme Court was established to replace the General Superior Court of \r\nJudicature in 1876 by an act of the legislature. In 1901 this court was split \r\ninto two courts with the addition of the Superior Court.

In the early 1900s, Edward Tuck (1842-1938), a \r\nsuccessful international financier living in Paris, along with his wife Julia, \r\ndonated funds to build a new library. Guy Lowell, who designed the Museum of \r\nFine Arts in Boston, was engaged to design the library for the Society and the \r\nclassical building opened in 1911. The Society's <a href=\"http://www.nhhistory.org/library.html\" target=\"new\">Tuck Library</a> in \r\nConcord, New Hampshire has the largest collection of New Hampshire historical \r\ninformation available in northern New England. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>There are thousands of original source materials located in the Tuck Library, \r\nmany of which can be found nowhere else. Researchers that depend primarily on \r\ngenealogical information found on the Internet must realize that there is no \r\nsubstitute for the original records. Even those items that have been transcribed \r\nand published cannot be depended on for accuracy and completeness. And many of \r\nthe library holdings may never be transcribed, let alone scanned and placed on \r\nthe Internet!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tuck Library Holdings</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Tuck Library's printed collection contains about 50,000 items focusing on \r\nlocal history and genealogy including:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>About 5,000 genealogies of New England families, many unpublished </li>\r\n<li>About 2,000 state, county, and town histories from New Hampshire </li>\r\n<li>About 3,000 state, county, and town histories from around New England and \r\nNew York </li>\r\n<li>About 500 compilations of cemetery and vital records from all parts of New \r\nHampshire </li>\r\n<li>Printed vital records of other New England states, including about 300 \r\nvolumes from Massachusetts </li>\r\n<li>Over 1,000 volumes of town reports from New Hampshire prior to 1940 </li>\r\n<li>About 200 original volumes of New Hampshire church records </li>\r\n<li>Over 500 New Hampshire city directories, most published before 1950 </li>\r\n<li>Over 800,000 pages of New Hampshire newspapers (1756-1900), both originals \r\nand microfilm </li>\r\n<li>Over 3,000 publications on American fine and decorative arts, architecture, \r\nand music </li>\r\n<li>Over 30,000 profiles of New Hampshire notables indexed from biographical \r\ndictionaries, histories, obituaries, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The library's manuscript collection consists of about 1.5 million pages of \r\nmanuscripts collected since 1823. These items cover differing aspects of the \r\nhistory of the people of New Hampshire and are dated from 1620 to the late \r\ntwentieth century. The subjects covered include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Figures of national importance like Daniel Webster, Franklin Pierce, Mary \r\nBaker Eddy, John Parker Hale, and William E. Chandler </li>\r\n<li>Revolutionary War and Civil War figures like Gen. John Stark, Gen.

The first matter is to review the areas of your \r\nresearch that you will want to expand. Prepare research aids for the trip, \r\neither on paper or stored on your laptop. (Tuck Library has modem ports and \r\nelectrical outlets at each desk to aid the technologically savvy researcher.) Be \r\nsure to be outline specifically and concisely just what information you are \r\nlooking for on each family. </p>\r\n<p>Items to bring for your research trip include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Research aids discussed above </li>\r\n<li>Printouts of items to be reviewed - found in the online search </li>\r\n<li>Pencil, always best when working with old rare volumes to avoid permanent \r\nunintended marks </li>\r\n<li>Paper or laptop for taking notes </li>\r\n<li>Magnifying glass to aid in looking at difficult-to-read items</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Search the Online Catalog <em>Before</em> your Visit</strong></p>\r\n<p>Next you should search their <a href=\"http://nhhistory.library.net/\" target=\"new\">online catalog</a> ahead of time to see what information may be \r\navailable to review upon your arrival. If you do not have access to the \r\nInternet, this search can be conducted on the terminals located at the library \r\nfor just this purpose. Like most libraries, they have largely replaced their old \r\ncard catalog with computer terminals - three in the main reading room and two in \r\nspecial collections. (Not that they will discard the cards. There are some very \r\ngood reasons for not doing that.) If you wish access to any items in their \r\nspecial collections and you will be visiting on a Saturday, be sure to call \r\nahead to ensure your item will be available, as the special collections staff is \r\nnot available on that day. </p>\r\n<p>It is useful to take an in-depth look at the library catalog. In 1996 the \r\ncatalog became \"fully\" automated - meaning that they have not added any cards at \r\nall since then. With an automated catalog, you can perform many types of \r\nsearches that are not possible with cards. Say you want to find some recent \r\nbooks on the history of New Hampshire. In the old catalog, you would look under \r\n\"New Hampshire-History\" as a subject and find 272 items. Then where could you \r\ngo? You could decide to work in a smaller universe and look under \"New \r\nHampshire-History-Colonial Period,\" and see 123 items. The only arrangement \r\navailable is alphabetical by author. </p>\r\n<p>However, with the new catalog, you may utilize a function called \"sort.\" This \r\nis really just a way of changing the arrangement of the items. If you sort by \r\nthe date the item was published, you can instantly locate the most recent works \r\non a subject. You can do the same with genealogies. A search for books on the \r\nSmith family reveals that there are sixty-eight in the library. However, let's \r\nsay you researched Smith ten years ago in the library, so you only want the most \r\nrecent works. Use \"sort by date,\" and the most recent books appear at the \r\nbeginning of the list of results. </p>\r\n<p>The other way automated catalogs can be searched is by keywords. This is \r\nespecially handy if you have an unusual word. Say your friend has told you about \r\na book called, she thinks, \"Grandmother's Stories, Tales of my Grandmother, or \r\nsomething like that - I can't quite recall.\" Use \"grandmother\" as a keyword and \r\nyou will find just four items, which you can instantly call up on the screen. \r\nYou can also use more than one keyword at a time. Say you want a book, and you \r\nthink the title is \"The Lost Family.\" With a card catalog, you would not find \r\nthis book, because the title really is \"The Family I Lost.\" \"Lost\" and \"Family\" \r\nare both pretty common words in titles, but search the two together, and you'll \r\nfind the item quickly. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Librarians are your Friends!</strong></p>\r\n<p>The library staff is an important resource in locating all appropriate \r\nmaterials at the library. Bill Copeley is the head librarian of the New \r\nHampshire Historical Society. He has held this position since the mid-1970s. His \r\nexpertise in New Hampshire families and library holdings is invaluable. \r\nTechnical services librarian Philip Abbott joined the library in 1993. Philip's \r\nspecialty is in computers, his background is in history, and he has orchestrated \r\nthe conversion of the card catalog to the electronic version used today. In \r\naddition to the paid staff, trained volunteers are available to assist library \r\nvisitors. When requesting assistance it is important to keep the concise queries \r\nprepared for the trip in mind. Though the researcher may be fascinated with lots \r\nof details about the history of the family, the staff only needs to know enough \r\nto direct you to the appropriate area of the library. Long side trips are likely \r\nto confuse the matter at hand.</p>\r\n<p>For those who cannot make a trip to the library, search services are \r\navailable. You may request searches by phone, letter, or email. The first \r\nfifteen minutes are free and the fee for additional time is $20.00 per hour. \r\nPhotocopies are limited to copyright restrictions as well as condition of the \r\noriginal and number of pages requested. The cost is twenty cents for members and \r\ntwenty-five cents for non-members per page. The Reprographic Services Department \r\nis equipped to reproduce historic maps, photographs, broadsides, and other \r\nimages for you. If your request requires professional research, a list of New \r\nHampshire researchers can be provided. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Location, Location, Location</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Tuck Library is located at 30 Park Street in Concord, New Hampshire, \r\n03301-6384. The phone number is (603)228-6688 and they can be reached by <a href=\"mailto:library@nhhistory.org\">email</a> at library@nhhistory.org. The \r\nhours for the library are 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday. The \r\nSpecial Collections Department operates 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Tuesday through \r\nFriday. Visitors to the library who are not members of the New Hampshire \r\nHistorical Society are charged a $6.00 library user fee. There is no fee for \r\nmembers, full-time students, or visitors who only want to search the catalog \r\nterminals. </p>\r\n<p>To get to the library take Interstate 93 to exit 14. Northbound - turn left \r\nat the light at the end of the exit ramp; Southbound - turn right at the light \r\nat the end of the exit ramp. Move into the left lane in order to take a left \r\nonto North Main Street. Take the next right onto Park Street (a one-way street \r\nthat goes up the right side of the State House). At the stop sign, continue \r\nstraight; the New Hampshire Historical Society's Tuck Library is the large \r\ngranite building on the right. Metered parking is available on surrounding \r\nstreets. Library researchers and visitors are encouraged to take advantage of \r\nfree parking at the Museum of New Hampshire History just three blocks away. \r\n</p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/the-tuck-library-at-the-new-hampshire-historical-society/", "published": "August 30, 2002", "id": 348}, {"author": "Marian S. Henry", "country": "New York", "title": "An Easier Way to Obtain New York State Vital Records", "content": "<p>Obtaining vital record information in upstate New York is difficult. There is \r\nno kinder way to state it. You will not find them published in books to be found \r\non shelves of public libraries and they are not available on the Internet. Using \r\nform DOH-1562 one may submit a request to the vital records section of New York \r\nState Department of Health (Corning Tower Bldg/ESP, Albany, N.Y. 12237-0023, Ph: \r\n[518] 474-3077) for an uncertified copy of a birth, marriage, or death record. \r\nYou can download this form from their <a href=\"http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/consumer/vr.htm\" target=\"new\">website</a>. If an exact date for the event is not known, a search \r\nmay be performed, but the researcher could pay dearly for this service. The \r\nminimum fee of $11 covers a search of one to three years. The maximum fee listed \r\nis $81 to search sixty-one to seventy years. The fee is retained whether or not \r\nthe record is found. In Albany, a single person processes all requests for \r\ncertificates. I am told that this person is currently about two years behind. \r\nUntil recently, the index to the vital records of upstate New York was only \r\navailable at the New York State Archives in Albany and the National Archives \r\nNortheast Region in New York City. However, the job just got easier. A third \r\ncopy of the index became available to the public in October 2000 at the main \r\npublic library in Rochester, N.Y. While the information remains the same, the \r\nsetting is much different. The index in Rochester is administered by friendly \r\npeople dedicated to helping genealogists.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>The index, which consists of thousands of microfiche, contains entries of \r\nbirths, marriages, and deaths for the entire state outside New York City or \r\nBrooklyn. It includes information from towns in Kings County before annexation \r\nby Brooklyn, and also portions of the counties of Westchester, Richmond, and \r\nQueens before they were annexed by New York City. It does not include births and \r\ndeaths in Albany, Buffalo, and Yonkers before 1914 or marriages before 1908. \r\nThese earlier records may be available through the local registrar of each \r\ncounty. While adopted babies are not included in the birth index, there is \r\ninformation about babies born in state facilities. New York State Archives \r\ninformation <a href=\"http://www.archives.nysed.gov/holding/fact/vital.htm\" target=\"new\">leaflet #2 </a>contains more complete information. Statewide \r\nregistration of vital records began in 1880-81. Marriage and death records are \r\nrestricted after 1950; birth records after 1925. These restrictions can be \r\nwaived for direct descendents, but the index entries are not available after \r\nthese dates. Data on living persons is restricted regardless. </p>\r\n<p>The index is arranged by year. Within each year entries are arranged by \r\nsurname or, in later years, by Soundex code. Each index entry contains name, \r\ndate, place, and certificate number (an identifier assigned by the State \r\nDepartment of Health). For example, the first entry in the index of birth \r\nrecords reads: </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>1881, Abbott, Georgianna, 22 Sept., Unionville, #4045 \r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>This serves as an official statement by the State of New York that this event \r\ntook place. Finding the entry in the index assures the researcher that the \r\ncertificate exists, decreasing the probability of a \"false negative.\" Searching \r\nfor a record that is not found costs just as much as a copy of the certificate. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>The information available for marriages varies with the time frame, as the \r\nfollowing example shows. The first marriage entry listed for the year 1881 is \r\nfor Julia D. Abbey. The entry contains the date and place, but no information \r\nabout the groom. Without the groom's surname, there is no way to move from here \r\nto a death record, or the birth records of children. Clearly the information on \r\nthe original certificate is required. There is an alternative to waiting for two \r\nyears for a reply from Albany, however. Help comes in the form of a \r\ngazetteer/directory combination. This index entry lists Arkwright as the \r\nlocation where Julia Abbey's marriage was recorded. The gazetteer places \r\nArkwright in Chautauqua County. The directory gives the address and phone number \r\nof the current Registrar of Vital Statistics in the town of Arkwright. It is \r\nlikely that this person will be able to process a request significantly faster \r\nthan that poor, overworked soul in Albany. </p>\r\n<p style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">Later marriage records can yield more information, \r\nsince there is a link to the spouse. These records also use the Soundex system, \r\nso the research methodology is slightly different. My example is the last \r\nmarriage record publicly available - the last entry under \"Z\" in 1951. The entry \r\nreads:</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p style=\"margin-right: 0px;\">624, Zerkle, Joan M., Buffalo, Stee, 6 30, 24778 \r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The three-digit number represents the Soundex code for the surname Zerkle \r\n(6-R, 2-K, 4-L). The location, Buffalo, is where the license was issued, but not \r\nnecessarily where the marriage was performed. The next entry, Stee, is the first \r\nfour letters of the spouse's surname, and following that is the month and day on \r\nwhich the marriage occurred. The final entry is the certificate number. With \r\nthis information it is possible to find the groom. The first four letters give a \r\npartial Soundex number of S3xx, but we do not know what other consonants might \r\nbe in the full surname. The index is arranged by year, and then by Soundex code, \r\nso we start with the S300 entries for 1951 and search for \"Zerk\" in the spouse \r\ncolumn. The image quality is good; the information is typewritten. This is not \r\ndifficult. Here he is on the second fiche I try.<br><br>\"340, Steele, Richard E, \r\nBuffalo, Zerk, 6 30, 24778\" </p>\r\n<p>Place, date and, most importantly, certificate number match. Joan Zerkle \r\nbecame Mrs. Richard Steele. </p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/an-easier-way-to-obtain-new-york-state-vital-records/", "published": "May 30, 2002", "id": 349}, {"author": "Marian S.

The legislation was \r\nmodeled on a bill passed by Congress, on September 16, 1776.&#160; In the federal \r\nlegislation a private soldier was granted 100 acres; higher ranks were granted \r\nprogressively more land, up to 500 acres to a colonel.&#160; In New York State, the \r\nland bounties were combined giving each qualified private a total of 600 \r\nacres.</p>\r\n<p><strong>First setback </strong></p>\r\n<p>On July 25, 1783, the state legislature specified 1.8 million acres of land \r\nto be set aside for this so-called &#8220;Military Tract.&#8221;&#160; This land, the lush Finger \r\nLakes region in the center of the state, included all the present counties of \r\nOnondaga, Cayuga, Cortland, and Seneca, as well as parts of the counties of \r\nOswego, Wayne, Schuyler, and Tompkins.&#160; Unbelievably, the specified region \r\ncontained Indian land recognized previously in treaties by both the federal and \r\nstate governments.&#160; It took three years before the state proposed to offer \r\nalternative land in Clinton, Essex, and Franklin counties on May 5, 1786.&#160; This \r\narea, in the extreme northeastern portion of the state, is part of the current \r\nAdirondack Park.&#160; As it was not well suited for farming, the plan was rejected.&#160; \r\nFor this reason the region became known as the &#8220;Old Military Tract.&#8221;&#160; Hall \r\nexplains: &#8220;Since the close of the war, land speculators had been engaged in \r\npurchasing from the veterans the rights to bounty lands, and, as the lands \r\ndesignated in this act were not considered to be as fertile as those around the \r\nfinger lakes, objections were raised to the substitution of this northern \r\nsection.&#160; In view of this opposition, it was decided to wait until the Indian \r\ntitle to the territory originally set apart as bounty lands should be \r\nextinguished before proceeding with the distribution.&#8221;&#160; It should be noted that \r\nthe opposition came not from veterans, but land speculators who had, by this \r\ntime, acquired most of the rights to the bounty lands.&#160; Another two years passed \r\nbefore treaties with the Onondaga and Cayuga tribes released the original \r\nMilitary Tract land in 1788.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Land Distribution</strong></p>\r\n<p>In an act dated February 28, 1789, the legislature described the balloting \r\nprocedure. </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>&#8220;... the said commissioners shall cause the names of each of the officers, \r\nnon-commissioned officers, and privates, ...to be written upon separate ballots \r\nor tickets, ... the ballots or tickets to be rolled up and put into a box, and \r\nthen cause one hundred ballots or tickets to be made and numbered from one to \r\none hundred, which said ballots or tickets shall also be rolled up and put in a \r\nseparate box for township No. 1, and as many ballots or tickets numbered and \r\nrolled up for township No. 2, ... they shall appoint one or more persons who \r\nshall first draw a ticket from the box in which the names are put, and then a \r\nticket from the numbers of township No. 1 ... shall proceed in the same manner \r\nto draw the lots in the other townships until the whole drawing is completed, \r\nand the lots in each township drawn next after the ticket marked with the name \r\nof the person entitled to such lands ... the said commissioners shall make a \r\nfull and fair account in a book ... &#8221;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>On July 3, 1790, the survey of the authorized twenty-five townships was \r\ncompleted and the board began issuing letters patent.&#160;

A township was never a political entity.&#160; It was a square tract \r\nof land containing sixty thousand acres surveyed into six hundred-acre lots \r\n(remember that each private soldier was entitled to a total of six hundred \r\nacres).&#160; The only purpose of a township was to distribute bounty land to \r\nsoldiers.&#160; A town, on the other hand, is a political subdivision of a county, \r\nand a form of local government.&#160; The twenty-eight townships of the Military \r\nTract were originally formed into eleven towns.&#160; Thus the original <em>town \r\n</em>of Homer was composed of the <em>townships</em> of Homer, Solon, Virgil, \r\nand Cincinnatus.&#160; Similarly, the original town of Lysander was composed of the \r\ntownships of Lysander, Hannibal, and Cicero.&#160; Some lands reserved to the \r\nOnondaga and Cayuga tribes when the Military Tract was first set up were \r\nacquired later.&#160; These lands were not part of the townships, but were \r\nincorporated into the towns.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Second Setback</strong></p>\r\n<p>Even though the Indian claims to the original Military Tract had been \r\nextinguished, the survey was still flawed.&#160; It was not until the end of July \r\n1790 that the state noticed that the Military Tract, as it had been surveyed, \r\noverlapped the tract to the south known as Boston Ten Towns. As Hall \r\nexplains,&#8220;The board immediately checked the awards already made, and found that \r\nthere were four lots in Township No. 23, fifteen in township No. 24 and three in \r\nTownship No. 25, which had been balloted for, and which were affected by this \r\nnew difficulty.&#160; They also found that there were one lot in Township No. 23, \r\nfive lots in Township No. 24, and one lot in township No. 25, not as yet awarded \r\nto claimants, which were also affected.&#8221;[2] &#160; </p>\r\n<p>In other words, the state had been giving away land it did not own.&#160; In order \r\nto provide additional land to make up for this, two new townships were surveyed \r\n(completed January 29, 1791).&#160; Number 26 was named Junius and number 27 was \r\nnamed Galen.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Third Setback</strong></p>\r\n<p>The preemption line, which served as the boundary between the Military Tract \r\nand the Phelps-Gorham purchase to the west, had been surveyed in 1788.&#160; When the \r\nland was sold to Robert Morris in 1790, one of the provisions of the sale was \r\nthat the line be resurveyed.&#160; The resurvey of the preemption line shifted the \r\nwestern boundary of the Military Tract eastward, reducing the size of several \r\ntownships.&#160; On September 11, 1794, the twenty-eighth and final township, named \r\nSterling, was authorized to make up territory lost in this shift of the \r\npreemption line.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>The Final Decision</strong></p>\r\n<p>In January 1794, the legislature attempted to clear up conflicting land \r\nclaims by requiring that all deeds and conveyances be sent to Albany.&#160; According \r\nto Hall, &#8220;the title to these lands became a scandal.&#8221;&#160; Some soldiers had been \r\ntricked into selling their claims and other soldiers did a bit of defrauding \r\nthemselves, selling their claim more than once.&#160; In 1797, in answer to a \r\npetition, a commission was set up to make a final decision on conflicting land \r\nclaims.&#160; The commission completed its work in 1803.&#160; By the time the state had \r\ncompleted its goal of establishing a frontier settlement of veterans, the \r\nfrontier had overtaken the Military Tract and moved on.&#160; By 1803 lands in \r\ncentral and western New York State were settled.&#160; Lewis and Clark were \r\norganizing their expedition into the new frontier -- the Louisiana Purchase.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br>II The Soldiers</strong> </p>\r\n<p><strong>Conrad Bush</strong></p>\r\n<p>In the entire town of Pompey the only Revolutionary War soldier to settle on \r\nthe land awarded to him was Conrad Bush, who drew lot 47.[3] Conrad Bush was \r\nborn in Germany[4] ; from the age on his tombstone he was born in 1753. Georg \r\nConrad Busch arrived in Philadelphia on October 9, 1775, on the ship <em>King of \r\nPrussia</em>.[5] I did not find a naturalization record for him in \r\nPhiladelphia.[6] In his <em>Index to Revolutionary War Service Records</em>, \r\nVirgil D. White[7] lists the following: </p>\r\n<p>Bush, Conratt, srv in Yates&#8217; Regt of NY Mil</p>\r\n<p>Bush, Conrod, srv as a Pvt in Rawlings&#8217; Regt of Cont troops</p>\r\n<p>Bush, Conrod, srv as a Pvt &amp; Matross* in 2<sup>nd</sup> Arty Regt of Cont \r\nTroops</p>\r\n<p>*A matross is a kind of gunners mate.</p>\r\n<p>The name is not common in the area, so it is likely that these all refer to \r\nthe same individual.&#160; The first entry is sufficient to entitle him to the state \r\nbounty land.</p>\r\n<p>After the war, Conrad Bush settled first in Mamakating Town in Ulster County, \r\nwith his wife, Mary Watson.&#160; The 1790 federal census lists George Coonradt Bush \r\n(1 M &gt;16, 1 M &lt;16, 3 F).&#160; Later census records list him at his farm in \r\nPompey, although the name of the location changed as local governments evolved. \r\nCensus indexes track his movements over the next twenty years: in 1800, a \r\n<em>Coonrad</em> Bush was in Ontario Co.; in 1810, a <em>Conrad</em> Bush was in \r\nOnondaga Co.; and in 1820, <em>Conrod</em> Bush appeared in Onondaga Co., Pompey.&#160; \r\nAs with his service record, his German accent shines through in these census \r\nrecords.</p>\r\n<p>Conrad Bush applied for a pension.&#160; The entry[8] reads &#8220;Bush, Conrad, Cont., \r\nN.Y. res., S46424; BLWt. 6870-100. Iss. 7/11/1791 No papers.&#8221;&#160; His wife died in \r\n1848; Conrad died in 1854.&#160; The burial location[9] is &#8220;Bush, Conradt, Sand \r\nKnoll, his farm, Pompey NY.&#8221;&#160; The tombstone inscriptions of the couple read[10] \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Conrad Bush / Died&#160; Dec. 19 1854 / Ae. 101 yrs. 1 mo. / &amp; 20 days.</p>\r\n<p>Mary / wife of Conrad Bush / Died&#160; Dec 3, 1848 / Ae. 81 yrs, 11 mos. &amp; 15 \r\ndays.</p>\r\n<p><strong>John Shepard</strong></p>\r\n<p>Similarly, in the town of Cicero, the only man who occupied his own bounty \r\nland was John Shepard. He was the first Justice of the Peace in the town in \r\n1804.[11]&#160;&#160; &#160; <br><br>According to Rev W. M. Beuchamp&#8217;s <em>Revolutionary \r\nSoldiers Resident or Dying in Onondaga Co., N.Y.</em>,[12] Captain John Shepard \r\nenlisted in 1777 in Capt. James Young&#8217;s Co. He left the army in the fall of 1781 \r\nfrom ill health and did not serve again.&#160; Beuchamp also claims a strong tie with \r\nStamford, Connecticut, saying, &#8220;He was ordained in North Stamford Congregational \r\nchurch, Conn., June 27, 1787, and was dismissed June 11, 1794.&#160; Several deeds \r\ndescribe him as of Stamford as late as &#8217;96, and in some he is styled \r\n&#8220;Reverend.&#8221;&#160; On June 7, 1783, he married Mrs. Melisent Edsall, widow of Nehemiah \r\nFinor, by whom he had four children.&#160; After leaving Stamford he lived in Orange \r\nCo., N. Y., which was partly peopled from that part of Westchester which \r\nStamford claimed.&#8221;&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Beuchamp also lists the following cemetery inscriptions:</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Rev.

Consider the following:</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>A collection of biographies of Stamford&#8217;s Revolutionary War soldiers[13] does \r\n<em>not</em> contain an entry for John Shepard/Shepherd.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The only <em>Captain </em>John Shepard listed in White&#8217;s index[14] served \r\nfrom Massachusetts.&#160; The entry reads: &#8220;Shepard, John, srv as Capt in Porter&#8217;s \r\nRegt of MA Mil.&#8221;&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The Pension List of 1820[15] contains the following entry: &#8220;John Shepard, \r\ncaptain, Massachusetts.&#8221;&#160; </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>However, service for New York State is a requirement for obtaining the bounty \r\nland.&#160; Of the fourteen &#8220;John Shepard&#8221; entries in White,[16] there is one for a \r\nNew York regiment: &#8220;Shepard, John, srv as Pvt in Hasbrouck&#8217;s Regt of NY Mil.&#8221; \r\nThe index[17] of Revolutionary War pension applications contains the following \r\nentry: &#8220;Shepard, John, Cont., N.Y., S42292.&#8221;&#160; Patricia Law Hatcher confirms the \r\nburial place in her <em>Abstract of Graves of Revolutionary Patriots</em>: \r\n&#8220;Shepard, John, Shepard Point, Oneida Lake, nr Syracuse, Bremerton NY&#8221;.[18] </p>\r\n<p><strong>Benjamin Epton</strong></p>\r\n<p>The experience of Private Benjamin Epton was significantly different.&#160; There \r\nis probably a tale for another time behind this brief outline.&#160; White lists his \r\nservice record as follows:[19] </p>\r\n<p>Epton, Benjamin, srv as a Pvt in the 2<sup>nd</sup> NY Regt</p>\r\n<p>Epton, Benjamin, srv as a Pvt in the 4<sup>th</sup> NY Regt</p>\r\n<p>Epton, Benjamin, srv in the 11<sup>th</sup> Regt of Cont Troops</p>\r\n<p>Again, there is no evidence from this source as to whether or not this refers \r\nto a single individual.&#160; However, the following discharge paper confirms the \r\nfirst entry.[20] &#160; </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>&#8220;By his Excellency GEORGE WASHINGTON, Esquire, General and Commander in Chief \r\nof the forces of the United States of America.&#160; These are to certify that the \r\nbearer hereof, BENJAMIN EPTON, private in the second N.

The within \r\ncertificate shall not avail the bearer as a discharge until the ratification of \r\nthe definite Treaty of peace, previous to which time and until proclamation \r\nthereof shall be made, he is to be considered as being on furlough - George \r\nWashington.&#8221;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>&#160; In 1790, Benjamin Epton received his grant to lot #7 in the town of \r\nCamillius.[21] </p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>&#8220;The People of the State of New York, by the Grace of God, free and \r\nindependent.&#160; To all to whom these presents shall come, Greeting:&#160; Know ye, that \r\nin pursuance of an act of our legislature, passed the sixth day of April, one \r\nthousand seven hundred and ninety, entitled, an act to carry into effect the \r\nconcurrent resolutions and acts of the legislature for granting certain lands \r\npromised to be given and bounty lands, and for other purposes therein \r\nmentioned,&#8217; we have given, granted and confirmed, and by these presents do give, \r\ngrant and confirm unto Benjamin Epton, all that certain tract or lot of land \r\nsituate, lying and being in the County of Montgomery, and in the township of \r\nCamillus known ... by Lot number seven, containing six hundred acres, together \r\nwith all and singular the rights, hereditaments and appurtenances, ...&#160; On \r\ncondition never the less that within the term of seven years to be computed from \r\nthe first day of January next ensuing the date hereof, there shall be one actual \r\nsettlement made on the said tract or lot of land hereby granted, otherwise, \r\nthese, our letters patent, and the estate hereby granted, shall cease, determine \r\nand become void. ... this sixth day of July, in the year of our Lord, one \r\nthousand seven hundred and ninety, and in the fifteenth year of our \r\nindependence.&#8221;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>However, by the time he received his \r\npatent on July 6, 1790, Benjamin Epton seems to have sold his land to John \r\nSuffern on November 10, 1784, but apparently Suffern did not or could not prove \r\nhis claim. Epton appears to have successfully sold his land to Charles \r\nWeissenfel, on November 12, 1784.</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"margin-right: 0px;\"><p>&#8220;THIS INDENTURE made the tenth day of November one thousand seven hundred and \r\neighty-four, between BENJAMIN EPTON, a privet soldier in the Second New York \r\nRegiment, of the first part, and John Suffern, of the New Antrinn of Orange \r\nCounty, Esqr. of the other part, WITNESSETH that the said Benjamin Epton, ... \r\nhath sold ... my right, title, claim, interest and demand from Congress or the \r\nUnited States to One Hundred Acres of land due me as a bounty as well as all my \r\nright, title, claim and demand from the State of New York to six hundred acres \r\nof land due me as a bounty and I do by these presents sell, release, convey, \r\nconfirm and forever quit-claim unto John Suffern aforesaid all and every my \r\nabove deeded rights, to have and to hold the same as his won and his heirs right \r\nagainst me and my heirs forever, and I do hereby empower the Surveyor-General of \r\nthe United States and of his State to convey whatever lands are due me for my \r\nservices as aforesaid to convey the same unto John Suffern or to his lawful \r\nrepresentatives and their heirs forever.&#160; In witness whereof I have hereunto set \r\nmy hand and fixed my seal the day above written.&#160; Benjamin his mark Epton.&#160; \r\nSealed and delivered in the presents of Jonas Secor, Jonat Youngs.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>&#160;&#8220;I, BENJAMIN EPTON, do acknowledge to have sold unto Mr. Charles F. \r\nWeissenfel all my rights of land due me from the State of New York and the \r\npublick for my services as a soldier in the 2d New York Regiment in the service \r\nof the United States, for which I subscribe my name as a security to the said \r\nWeissenfel on the back of this discharge as witness my hand and seal this 12th \r\nday of Novr. 1784.&#160; Witness John Satten, Benjamin Epton, his \r\nmark.&#8221;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Apparently the second claim was validated.&#160; The entry for his pension \r\napplication reads: &#8220;Epton, Benjamin, N.Y., BLWts. 7095 &amp; 7901-100-Pvt.

Henry", "country": "New York", "title": "County Historians for the State of New York", "content": "<div id=\"paging\">Have you got an obscure ancestor who's hiding in the mists of time? \r\nOr do you want to know more about your ancestor's life than a few dates?\r\n Interested in the local history of a far away township? Perhaps it's \r\ntime to consider consulting a county historian. The county historian is \r\nan expert in local history. This person possesses records that may not \r\nbe widely available in larger collections. <div class=\"page\"><p>New York State has \r\nrequired the appointment of historians as part of local government since\r\n 1919. The appointments and the job descriptions are local, varying from\r\n one location to another, but in general </p>\r\n<p>County and municipal \r\nhistorians oversee the historical files of their communities, educate \r\nthe public and the schools, promote historic preservation, oversee \r\nhistoric sites and run historical commemorations. They work closely with\r\n researchers, libraries, historical societies, genealogical societies \r\nand every segment of the general public.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>The county \r\nhistorian will tell you what records are available. For example, the <a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.com/~nywyomin/\" target=\"_new\">county \r\nhistorian's office</a> in Wyoming, NY has over four file cabinets of \r\ngenealogical queries and over 70 genealogies. The marriage records of \r\nClinton County are only accessible for the years 1908 to 1936 and are \r\nkept in the <a href=\"htttp://www.rootsweb.com/~nyclinto/\" target=\"_new\">County Clerk's Office</a>. The documents in a county \r\nhistorian's office might include genealogies, census records, local \r\nhistories, newspapers, wills, cemetery records, church records, vital \r\nrecords, tax lists, maps, and photographs.</p>\r\n<p>A county historian's \r\nresponse to genealogical queries varies from one county to the next, but\r\n the majority do not do genealogical research. The Wayne County \r\nHistorian, for example, will search the office records for $20/hour with\r\n a $10 minimum charge. Your query must be concise and specific. There is\r\n an <a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.com/~nywayne/wcoht.html\" target=\"_new\">online form</a> available and there is generally no charge\r\n for people who come to the office to do their own searching. On the \r\nother hand, \" The <a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.com/~nysulliv/\" target=\"_new\">Sullivan County Historian</a> does not do genealogical \r\nresearch, nor does he have access to the county's genealogical records.\"\r\n Usually, however, the county historian will be able to put you in touch\r\n with local historians who will do research and will be able to supply \r\nyou with information if you know exactly what you want. </p>\r\n<p>If you \r\nrequest information from a county historian, be sure to include all \r\npertinent facts, but be concise. Supply a surname and dates as best you \r\nknow them, but your relation to this person is not relevant. Be very \r\nclear about what you want. Stick to one item at a time. Include a \r\nstamped self-addressed envelope (big enough to hold the anticipated \r\nreply). The office may be open only part-time and may be understaffed. \r\nPlease be patient, kind, and courteous. The office does not have a large\r\n budget, so don't expect a return long distance telephone call.</p>\r\n<p>The\r\n following table lists county historians for 51 upstate New York \r\ncounties. The county seat is generally the location of the county \r\nhistorian's office. The date for the erection of each county is given, \r\nas is its parent county or counties. (Records that predate the creation \r\nof a county will be found in the parent county.) Those entries prefixed \r\nby an asterisk were taken from a 1997 compilation<sup>2</sup>; other \r\nentries were obtained from county websites linked from the <a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.com/~nygenweb/\" target=\"_new\">New York State</a>\r\n siteat rootsweb.com for the <a href=\"http://www.usgenweb.org/\" target=\"_new\">USGenWeb</a> project.

For records at \r\nthe county level, this requires keeping track of the changes in local \r\ngovernment over time. Many of us have faced the situation in which our \r\npioneer ancestors settled in a location before formation of the modern \r\ncounty. Thus the earliest records for a location can be in a county seat\r\n quite far removed from the current one. A case in point is Ontario \r\nCounty in New York State. In its current form, Ontario County covers an \r\narea of 640 square miles in central New York State. However, when first \r\nformed in 1789, this venerable county encompassed an area of roughly \r\n2500 square miles! It covered all of New York State west of the \r\npreemption line -- very roughly, a north-south line from Lake Ontario to\r\n the Pennsylvania line passing through the northern end of Seneca Lake. \r\nThe earliest records of this region, which currently consists of \r\nfourteen counties, are held in the Ontario County Records and Archives \r\nCenter in Canandaigua. I toured this facility in November 2001 and \r\ndescribe here what I found.</p>\r\n <p>Ontario County maintained its initial\r\n size for less than twenty years. This was a time of intense land \r\nspeculation and hundreds of deeds in this time period track the land \r\nbeing sold, resold, and subdivided. Steuben County was formed from the \r\nsouthern portion of Ontario in 1796, and records for that county can be \r\nfound in Bath. Territory to the west became Genesee County (county seat \r\nBatavia) in 1802. Genesee daughter counties include Allegany (1806); \r\nCattaraugus, Niagara, and Chautauqua (all 1808); Orleans (1824); and \r\nWyoming (1841). Livingston County (county seat Geneseo) was formed in \r\n1821 from parts of both Ontario and Genesee counties. More territory to \r\nthe south was lost with the creation of Yates County (county seat Pen \r\nYan) in 1823. The present northern boundary was formed with the creation\r\n of Wayne County (county seat Lyons), also in 1823.</p>\r\n <p>The Ontario \r\nCounty Records and Archives Center is located about three miles east of \r\ndowntown Canandaigua, the county seat, in the town of Hopewell. \r\n(Canandaigua, pronounced can-an-DAY-gwa, is on the northern tip of \r\nCanandaigua Lake, less than ten miles south of exits #43 or #44 on the \r\nNew York State thruway.) The center receives material from all of the \r\ncounty offices. Three full-time staff members work to convert the \r\nincoming records to microfilm. After filming, records are either \r\nreturned to the county office or shredded, depending on the content. \r\nOriginal material to be archived is stored in acid-free folders and \r\nboxes in a climate-controlled chamber on floor-to-ceiling rolling \r\nshelves. Some of the records in the facility are closed to the public by\r\n court order or state law. Most of the records useful for genealogical \r\nresearch have been microfilmed. The following is a description of these \r\nrecords. </p>\r\n <p><strong>Census Records</strong><br><br>Ontario County federal \r\ncensus records from 1790 to 1920 are available on microfilm at the \r\nArchives Center. Indexes are available for 1790 to 1820, 1850, and 1860.\r\n State census records are available for 1845, 1855, 1865, 1875, 1892, \r\n1905, 1915, and 1925. The indexes for 1850, 1855, 1860, 1865, 1870, and \r\nsome indexes for 1875 are available online at the Archives Center <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://raims.com/censusmenu.html\">website</a>.</p>\r\n <p><strong>Land\r\n Records</strong><br><br>Deeds are available from 1789 (the inception of the \r\ncounty) to 1915 and include the original pioneer sales in the \r\nPhelps-Gorham purchase. Mortgage records from 1789 to 1947 and \r\nassessment rolls from 1789 to 1993 are also available. Although the \r\nearly records are not complete, they can be a useful complement to deeds\r\n and mortgages. <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://raims.com/deedmenu.html\">Indexes\r\n to deeds</a> from 1789 to 1845 are online.</p>\r\n <p><strong>Court Records</strong><br><br>County\r\n court records have not been fully indexed; it is a work in progress. \r\nThe indexes for <a href=\"http://raims.com/naturalizations.html\">nineteenth</a>\r\n and <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://raims.com/nat20.html\">twentieth</a>&#160;century\r\n naturalization records however, are available online. Holdings cover \r\nthe time span 1803-1956 and include declarations of intent, petitions \r\nfor citizenship, and naturalization certificates. Surrogate Court \r\nrecords (1789-1965) are indexed by name; indexes up to 1926 are <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://raims.com/surrogate.html\">online</a>. Files \r\ncan include inventories and debts along with wills. Guardianship \r\nrecords, available for the years 1789 to 1929, usually involve \r\nadministering estates of minors. Jury lists for the nineteenth century \r\nare available at the Center and their <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://raims.com/jury.html\">indexes</a> are \r\navailable online. In addition to establishing the residency of your \r\nancestor, these lists also sometimes list occupation.</p>\r\n <p><strong>Military\r\n Records</strong><br><br>Revolutionary War pension records and some early \r\nmilitia records are available. Draft lists are available for 1862, 1864,\r\n and 1917. A variety of Revolutionary and Civil War records are listed \r\non the Center website.</p>\r\n <p><strong>Poor House Indentures</strong><br><br>Lists \r\nof children indentured to Ontario County families in the nineteenth and \r\nearly twentieth century are available. The index is <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://raims.com/indenture.html\">online</a> and \r\nincludes child's name, guardian's name, year, and town.</p>\r\n <p><strong>Vital \r\nRecords</strong><br><br>Compared with other regions like New England, there \r\nare very few vital records for New York State. The state did not require\r\n vital records until 1880. The vital records that do exist are usually \r\nheld by the individual municipality rather than the county. The Center \r\ndoes have some <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://raims.com/marriage.html\">marriage\r\n records</a> from 1908 to 1935, which are listed on the website. \r\nAlternative vital records sources such as newspapers or diaries are not \r\nfound here. This they properly leave to historical societies.</p>\r\n <p><strong>How\r\n to Access the Records</strong></p>\r\n <p>Ontario County Records and Archives \r\nCenter<br>3051 County Complex Drive<br>Canandaigua, New York, 14424<br>Tel:\r\n (716) 396-4376<br>Fax: (716) 396-4390<br><a href=\"mailto:hansfinke@co.ontario.ny.us\">E-mail records management \r\nofficer Hans Finke</a><br><a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://raims.com/\">Website</a>\r\n (From this home page, click on \"site map\" for links to individual \r\nindexes.)</p>\r\n <p>The center is usually open for research from 9:00 a.m. \r\nto 4:30 p.m. weekdays, but call ahead to be sure regular hours are in \r\neffect.

In this article we take a look at a quiet, \r\nunassuming group &#8211; the Welsh. Welsh immigration did not begin in the \r\nnineteenth century, of course. Fourteen generals of the Revolutionary \r\narmy were Welshmen. Eighteen of the signers of the Declaration of \r\nIndependence were of Welsh descent.[1] Both Thomas Jefferson and John \r\nAdams claimed Welsh lineage.[2] However, waves of Welsh immigrants came \r\nto America between 1800 and 1850. There was some degree of social unrest\r\n in Wales with low farm prices, high rents, and a shift to \r\nindustrialization. Farmers&#8217; children had to leave the land to work in \r\nthe mines. In America they saw the promise of cheap land, religious \r\nfreedom, and a chance for advancement. Although they came to America in \r\ngroups and settled together, they did not cling to their ethnic \r\nbackground like the Palatines or the Irish. Within two or three \r\ngenerations they were assimilated. Thus, their &#8220;Welshness&#8221; can be hard \r\nto spot. You may have Welsh ancestors and not even know it. In this \r\narticle we look at ways of identifying these elusive Welshmen.</p>\r\n<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p>The clue that uncovers a Welsh[3] community can be quite small.

Y., \r\nand formed the nucleus of a welsh settlement, which has prospered and \r\nincreased in numbers until there are found in this and the adjoining \r\ntowns of Farmersville and Centreville a population of at least 500 of \r\nthese thrifty, law-abiding, enterprising people.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>In addition to listing the names of these six immigrants, the same \r\narticle mentions Ebenezer Baptist Church (Welsh), organized May 2, 1843,\r\n with forty-two members, and Salem Church (Welsh Calvinistic Methodist, \r\nfirst meeting in 1851). A more recent county history continues the \r\nhistory of these churches:[6] &#8220;Freedom Ebenezer Church, which is Welsh \r\nBaptist, observed its centennial in 1943. The old records were written \r\nin Welsh but Rev. R. J. Williams of Scranton, Pa. translated them and so\r\n furnished an excellent history to be read at that meeting.&#8221; The author \r\ngoes on to say that by 1895, the town had established Bethel Baptist \r\nChurch to accommodate Welsh children who wanted services in English. In \r\n1919 the two churches were combined, forming Freedom Baptist Church. The\r\n Calvinistic Methodist Church changed to Presbyterian in 1892. From this\r\n we have a picture of a group of families moving west, forming a \r\nsupportive frontier community. Within fifty years use of the Welsh \r\nlanguage was greatly diminished and before a hundred years had \r\ndisappeared altogether.</p>\r\n<p>A search for the &#8220;others&#8221; that accompanied or followed the six named \r\npioneers is conveniently begun using the 1850 Federal Census, which \r\nrecords place of birth. A survey for heads of household born in Wales \r\nfor the town of Freedom, Cattaraugus County, yields the names in Table \r\nI. The names are presented alphabetically by page number. Although the \r\nentire census for Freedom occupies pages 430 to 450, half of the names \r\nin Table I are clustered on pages 430 to 434, and nearly three-quarters \r\nare on pages 430 to 438. This supports the idea of close proximity. The \r\nsix names listed by Ellis as having moved into Freedom in 1841 are all \r\nfound.[7] Undoubtedly a similar survey of the 1850 census records of \r\nadjoining towns, not forgetting neighboring Allegany and Wyoming \r\ncounties, would yield similar results.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Table I.

Since these Welsh settlers were said to have entered\r\n Cattaraugus County in 1841 from Oneida County, one might look for these\r\n names in the 1840 Federal Census of Oneida County. In fact, such a \r\nsearch yielded one or more matches for every one of them. Some of the \r\nnames are quite common. For example, I found eighteen entries for &#8220;John \r\nJones,&#8221; three for &#8220;John R. Jones,&#8221; but only one &#8220;John J. Jones.&#8221; All of \r\nthe name matches in the 1840 census come from ten contiguous towns in \r\nthe northeast section of Oneida County &#8211; Lee, Western, Steuben, Remsen, \r\nBoonville, Floyd, Trenton, Whitestown, Marcy, and Deerfield. All of \r\nthese towns are east of the city of Rome and north of the Mohawk \r\nRiver.[8] </p>\r\n<p>By comparing ages and family makeup it is possible in some cases to \r\nbe reasonably certain of a match between a family in Cattaraugus County \r\nin 1850 and in Oneida County in 1840. I chose two households as a test \r\ncase &#8211; Hugh O. Roberts and William E. Williams, entered next to each \r\nother on page 436 in the 1850 census for Freedom. </p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>1850 Federal Census, Freedom, Cattaraugus Co., NY, \r\np. 436</strong></p>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\" class=\"contentTableText\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"139\" valign=\"top\"><p>Name</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"43\" valign=\"top\"><p>Age</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"36\" valign=\"top\"><p>Sex</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"60\" valign=\"top\"><p>Born</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"139\" valign=\"top\"><p>Hugh O.

Samuel W. Williams, age 22, was born in Wales, but his \r\nyounger brother, William Williams, age 15, was born in New York. On this\r\n evidence the family of William E. Williams left Wales after 1828 and \r\nsettled in New York before 1835.

Pomroy Jones, writing in 1851 about the town of Remsen in Oneida\r\n County, states, &#8220;David Mound, John James, Griffith I. Jones, John \r\nOwens, Hugh Hughes came about 1808 to Remsen from Wales.&#8221;[9] These Welsh\r\n became successful dairy farmers and wrote back to Wales encouraging \r\nothers to come. It seems likely that only part of the Welsh community in\r\n Oneida County moved to Cattaraugus County, for he further states, &#8220;at \r\nleast three-fourths of its population are Welsh. It is said that Remsen,\r\n Steuben, Trenton, and portions of Deerfield, Marcy, and Boonville are \r\nalmost as well known in Wales as in Oneida County.&#8221;[10] Church records \r\nwould seem to be an appropriate tool for Welsh genealogy in this \r\ninstance. All of the churches in Remsen were Welsh as were six of the \r\nseven churches in the town of Steuben. </p>\r\n<p>In an 1896 county history, Daniel Wager described the twilight of the\r\n Welsh as a separate community in Oneida County. After speaking of the \r\narrival of Welsh settlers in Marcy, Remsen, and Steuben, he gives these \r\nparticulars of Thomas Thomas: </p>\r\n<p>&#8220;About the year 1800 the family of Thomas Thomas, another Welshman, \r\nsettled in this town [Steuben]. He had been a sailor and was a victim of\r\n the British press gangs. He afterwards lost his right leg in an \r\nengagement with a French ship; this occurred in 1796, and he was taken \r\nto Halifax, thence to Greenwich Hospital, and finally married and \r\nreturned to America. He died at the age of eighty-seven years, and was \r\nthe last survivor of the Welsh pioneers of this town.&#8221;[11] </p>\r\n<p>Even though a Welsh community melted into the mainstream quickly on a\r\n genealogist&#8217;s time scale, it maintained its identity long enough to \r\nleave local traces. In addition to the sources cited above, place names \r\ncan be a clue. A place named &#8220;Welsh Creek&#8221; or &#8220;Wales Hollow&#8221; may contain\r\n the echo of one of these evanescent communities. Table II contains a \r\nlist of some place names in New York State[12] containing &#8220;Welsh/Welch&#8221; \r\nor &#8220;Wales.&#8221; Consider the entry for &#8220;Welsh Hill,&#8221; a summit in the town of\r\n Plainfield in Otsego County. Was there once a Welsh community in \r\nPlainfield? I searched on the word &#8220;Welsh&#8221; on the Otsego County rootsweb\r\n site[13] and found reference[14] to the Welsh Congregational Church of \r\nPlainfield, organized in 1861, first pastor Hugh R. Williams. Further \r\nresearch should readily determine how this congregation came to \r\nPlainfield. </p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Table II.

Louis refused to keep his grandson from the line of succession to the French throne, which prompted fears of expansion. These actions led to the War of the Spanish Succession, which moved into America in 1702, where it was known as Queen Anne&#8217;s War. The conflict, which lasted from 1702 to 1713, pitted France and Spain against England, Austria, the Netherlands, and Portugal.&#160;The armies of Louis XIV invaded the Palatinate region of Germany, forcing residents to flee first to Holland, then by boat from Rotterdam to London.&#160;As they were victims of Britain&#8217;s enemy, these German-speaking Protestants were at first welcomed in London, and in 1709 the government issued sixteen hundred tents for Palatine encampments in Blackheath and elsewhere. The flood of immigrants that followed, estimated to be ten to thirty thousand (or two to five percent of the city&#8217;s population in 1710), became unsupportable.&#160; [Boston today has roughly the same population as London of 1710.&#160; Imagine the same number of immigrants sailing into Boston harbor and setting up a tent city on the Commons.]&#160; This situation led Her Majesty&#8217;s government to formulate a plan in which refugees needing aid could be transformed into colonists producing profit.&#160;The government proceeded to send several thousand of these German families to New York to produce naval supplies needed for the war by the Royal Navy. In return for passage to New York and maintenance, the Germans were to produce tar, turpentine, and ship&#8217;s masts.&#160; When the debt was repaid, each family would receive forty acres of land free from taxes or quit rents for seven years.&#160;Some three thousand people set sail for New York in 1710.&#160;They labored for about three years, but the project was an economic disaster and much ill will was generated.&#160;Finally, in 1713, the project was terminated, leaving the Palatines still in debt to the crown.&#160;Without permission, the Palatines left for the land that they claimed Queen Anne had promised them, in the Schoharie Valley where the Schoharie Creek flows into the Mohawk River.&#160;Their claim was not recognized in Albany, and in 1723, after a decade of violent dispute, this settlement disbanded, and many of the settlers moved south into Pennsylvania.</p>\r\n<strong>II. Arrival of Palatines into New York, 1709-1710</strong><p>These Palatines were not the first group of German-speaking settlers to arrive in New York.&#160; An earlier group of forty-one persons (ten men, ten women, and twenty-one children) led by Evangelical minister Joshua Kockerthal, was sent to New York by royal order on May 10, 1708.&#160; Filby[1] lists the arrival in 1709 of Joshua Kockerthal, age 39, his wife Sibylla Charlotta, 39, and children Benigna Sibylla, 10, Christian Joshua, 7, and Susanna Sibylla, 3.&#160; Rupp[2] lists the names, ages, and occupations of &#8220;Those Who Accompanied Rev. Joshua Kocherthal, who settled on lands on Quassick Creek, then Dutchess County, NY in the Spring of 1709.&#8221; in his Appendix No. IV.&#160; This group was not part of the Naval Stores project described in the preceding paragraph. They were given five hundred acres of land to form the town of Quassic, now Newburg (near the junction of interstates 84 and 87) and remained there. </p>\r\n<p>The main group of about three thousand distressed Germans sailed for New York in ten ships, arriving on June 13, 1710, with newly appointed royal governor, Robert Hunter.&#160; The passengers experienced much sickness during the voyage, and nearly five hundred were lost at sea.&#160; Upon arrival they were quarantined for several months on Nutten (now Governor&#8217;s) Island due to typhus on board.&#160; Thus they could not begin work until the spring of 1711.&#160; Genealogical information on over eight hundred of these families is available in Henry Jones&#8217; two-volume work <em>The Palatine Families of New York: a study of the German immigrants who arrived in colonial New York in 1710.</em>[3] His primary sources (original sources, not published transcriptions) include Rotterdam Sailing Lists of 1709, London Census of Palatines of 1709, Hunter Subsistance Lists 1710-1712, West Camp Census 1710-11, and the Simmendiger Register.</p>\r\n<p><strong>III. Naval Stores Project, 1709-1712</strong></p>\r\n<p>As early as 1699, the Earl of Bellomont, appointed governor of New York, Massachusetts Bay and New Hampshire, had proposed that the colony of New York be used for the production of naval supplies.&#160; He also suggested using garrisoned soldiers as the labor force in this initiative. Colonel Robert Hunter, who himself would later become governor of New York, coupled this suggestion with the exploding refugee problem and substituted the Palatines as the labor force.&#160; As described in this excerpt from a report by the Board of Trade dated December 5, 1709, the settlement was to be located along the Mohawk River.&#160; </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;we have considered the proposals made to us by Colonel Hunter for settling 3000 Palatines at New York, and Employing them in the Production of Naval stores, and thereupon humbly Represent to your Majesty &#8230; the most proper Places for the seating them in that Province, so as they may be of benefit to this Kingdom by the Production of Naval Stores, are on the Mohaques River, and on the Hudsons River &#8230;&#160; A Tract of land lying on the Mohaques River containing about 50 miles in length and four miles in breadth, and a Tract of land lying upon a creek [Schoharie Creek] which runs into the said River, containing between 24 and 30 Miles in length.&#160; This land mentioned, land of which your majesty has the possession, is claimed by the Mohaques, but that claim may be satisfied on very easy terms&#8230;&#160; We therefore humbly offer that the governor or commander in chief be Directed upon their Arrival&#8230; to grant under the Seal of that Province, without fee or Reward, 40 acres per head to each family, after they shall have repaid by the produce of their Labour, the charges the publick shall be at in setting and subsisting them there&#8230;. As these people are very necessitous, they will not be able to maintain themselves there, till they can reap the benefit of their labour which will not be till after one year at the soonest&#8230;&#160; Lastly, we humbly offer that the said Palatines upon their arrival there, be naturalized&#8230; that they may enjoy all such privileges and advantages as are Enjoyed by the present Inhabitants of that province.&#8221;[4] &#160; </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>For whatever reason, Governor Hunter decided against a settlement on Crown land. The Germans were then settled not on the banks of the Mohawk River, but on land along the Hudson River sold to the province by Robert Livingston, commissioner of Indian affairs.&#160; Four villages made up East Camp, located on the east side of the river at the present site of Germantown, in Columbia County.&#160; Three villages comprised West Camp, on the west side of the river at the present site of Saugerties.&#160; Governor Hunter also awarded to Livingston the contract for providing food and supplies to the Germans.&#160; At least two sources claim that Livingston cheated them.&#160; The reason is not clear.&#160; It may have been simple politics.&#160; Hunter was a Tory, Livingston a Whig.&#160; The Whigs, who had taken over the government while Hunter was en route to New York, ceased funding the project.&#160; &#160;For some reason Hunter continued to pay for the Germans&#8217; supplies until he&#8217;d emptied his purse.&#160; In any case, the Germans knew they were being cheated and blamed the governor.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>In the spring of 1711 they began work.&#160; Nearly one hundred thousand trees were felled and prepared.&#160; Roads were constructed to bring tar to the banks of the river.&#160; Coopers made barrels and cauldrons were made ready.&#160; However, the work did not prosper.&#160; Perhaps because neither the supervisors nor the workers knew how the process of extracting tar or producing turpentine was done.&#160; Perhaps because the species of pine available to them did not contain useful amounts of pitch.&#160; The best pine for tar and turpentine is the longleaf pine (<em>pinus palustris</em>), found only in the south.&#160; The best source colonists in New York had would have been the pitch pine (<em>pinus rigida</em>), found from southern Maine to northern Georgia.[5] &#160; Wallace[6] explains the failure thus: &#8220;Sackett was a local farmer who had persuaded the Governor (who understood nothing about the tar business) that he (Sackett) understood everything; and who, having been put in charge of production, had proceeded with great energy and confidence to have his hundred thousand trees barked in the wrong way.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>By the autumn of 1712 Hunter could no longer afford the expense and the Germans were left to fend for themselves, still in debt to the crown.&#160; Disgusted, they left for the land along the Schoharie Creek, which they claimed had been promised to them by Queen Anne.</p>\r\n<strong>IV. Schoharie Interlude, 1712-1723</strong><p>In the winter of 1712-13 about fifty families walked to the Schoharie Valley.&#160; The remainder joined them in the spring, making a total of between five and seven hundred people.&#160; They founded seven &#8220;dorfs,&#8221; or farming villages, along the Schoharie Creek[7] .&#160; The southernmost, Weiser&#8217;s Dorf, named for Conrad Weiser, was at the site of present-day Middleburgh and contained about forty dwellings.&#160; Hartman&#8217;s Dorf, named after Hartmen Winteker, was between Middleburgh and Schoharie, and contained sixty-five dwellings.&#160; Brunnen Dorf, at the site of present-day Schoharie Village, translates to Fountain Town, and was named for a large spring located near the current courthouse.&#160; Smith&#8217;s Dorf, named after Johannes George Smidt, was located about one mile north of Brunnen Dorf.&#160; Next to Smith&#8217;s Dorf were Fox&#8217;s Dorf and Fox&#8217;s Creek, both named for William Fox.&#160; Garlock&#8217;s Dorf, named for Elias Garlock, was between Schoharie and Central Bridge.&#160; Kneiskern&#8217;s Dorf, the most northerly settlement, and named for John Peter Kneiskern, was on the east side of the Schoharie River opposite the mouth of Cobel&#8217;s kill. </p>\r\n<p>Because the settlers were viewed in Albany as squatters, conflict was inevitable.&#160; On November 3, 1714, the Huntersfield Patent was sold by Governor Hunter to a group of businessmen[8] known as the &#8220;Seven Partners of Schoharie.&#8221; [The names of these men were Myndert Schuyler, Peter Van Brugh, Robert Livingston, Jr., John Schuyler, Henry Wileman, Lewis Morris, Jr., and Andrus Coeman.] &#160;&#160;Earlier, on August 26, 1714, Adam Vrooman obtained a patent to four hundred acres in the area.&#160; Vrooman, then aged seventy-five, apparently bought the land for his son Peter, who occupied it the same year with his own eldest son Bartholomew.&#160; Peter Vrooman was not well received by the Palatines, as his subsequent complaint makes clear. </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have mannured a great part of the Land and Sowed Considerable grain thereon they still drove their horses on in by night, I then hired my sones to go with me and build me a house&#8230; but on the 4<sup>th</sup> day of this Instant In ye night following they had a Contryvance to tie bells about the horses necks and drive them too and fro In which time they pulled my house Stones and all to the Ground the next day I spok with some of them and they used such Rebelious Expressions that was never heard off&#8230; John Conradus Wiser has been the Ring Leader of all factions for he has had his son some time to Live among the Indians and now he is turn&#8217;d their Interpreter&#8230; I am no wayes secure of my Life their for after I came away they went and pulld my son off of the wagon and beat him and said they would kill him or his father or anybody Else that came their&#8230; John Conradus Wiser &amp; 2 or 3 more has made their Escape by way of Boston and have said they will go for England but has left his son which is their Interpreter to the Indians and every day tells the Indians many Lyes&#8230; I am well Informed who are their Chiefes : for those that are good Subjects among them and will not Joyn with them are afraid the others will Burn their houses down by their threatening words&#8230;&#8221;[9] </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>When the sheriff was sent to intervene, he was mobbed by a group of determined Palatine women.&#160; </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;When the sheriff began to meddle with the first man, a mob of women rose, of which Magdalene Zee was captain.&#160; He [Sheriff Adams] was knocked down, and dragged through every mud-pool in the street; then hung on a rail and carried four miles, thrown down on a bridge, where the captain took a stake out of the fence, and struck him in the side, that she broke two of his ribs and lost one eye; then she pissed in his face, let him lie and went off.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>\"Knowing that discretion is the better part of valor, the wounded Adams made off for Albany.&#160; For a good time to come, the men of Schoharie stayed away from that city, sending women instead, but not forever.&#160; After things cooled, the partners had a sheriff&#8217;s posse waiting and a group of visiting Palatines, including Weiser junior, was seized and jailed.&#8221;[10] </p>\r\n<p>At this time (1718) an enumeration was made of the German families in New York&#160; &#160;A total of 394 families was tallied, included 170 in the &#8220;Seven Townships&#8221; in Schoharie and seven in &#8220;Wessels pretended land.&#8221;&#160; One of the signers of the account was Joshua Kocherthal.&#160; This is presumably the same Rev. Joshua Kocherthal who led the first group of Palatines. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>An Account of the families of Germans settled on Hudson&#8217;s River in the Province of New York, 1718.</strong>[11] </p>\r\n<div align=\"center\">&#160;</div><div align=\"center\"><table width=\"590\" class=\"contentTableText\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>On the East side of Hudson&#8217;s River</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>Location</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>Families</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p><strong>Persons</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Hunterstown</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p>25</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p>109</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Kingsberry</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p>33</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p>104</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Annberry</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p>17</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p>71</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Haysberry</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p>16</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p>75</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Rheinbeck</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p>35</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p>140</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>In Schohare</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Seven Townships</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p>170</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p>680</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>On the West Side</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>New Town</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p>14</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p>56</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>George Town</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p>13</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p>52</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Eliz: Town</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p>9</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p>36</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Kingstown</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p>15</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p>60</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Wessels pretended land</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p>7</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p>28</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Kingstown Sopes</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p>10</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p>40</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>At New York &amp; places adjacent</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p>30</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p>150</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\">&#160; </td>\r\n<td width=\"74\" valign=\"top\"><p>394</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"73\" valign=\"top\"><p>1601</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div><p align=\"center\">The widows &amp; orphans are not included in this list.<br>This to the best of our knowledge is the Acc<sup>ot</sup> of those people settled, amounting to 394 families, containing abut 1601 persons.<br>[signed] Joshua Kocherthal and John Fred.

They were waylaid and robbed by pirates.&#160; When they finally reached London they were jailed for debt. Both Scheff and Walrath died in London.

In the style of\r\n traditional immigration stories, but with a twist, I relate this tale \r\nof three Maries who sailed to Philadelphia to start a new life. These \r\nwere the three wealthy d'Ohet sisters, Marie Jaene (d'Ohet) d'Autremont,\r\n Marie Genevieve (d'Ohet) LeFevre, and Marie Claudine d'Ohet. My tale \r\nalso includes brief mention of a few non-noble characters for \r\ndecoration, namely Victor du Pont de Nemours and Capt. Joseph Juliand. \r\nMy information comes from several sources<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>3</sup><sup>4</sup><sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup>\r\n and is, by turns, ambiguous, contradictory, or wrong. In the process of\r\n attempting to corroborate these \"family myths\" with readily available \r\nprimary records,&#160;it becomes apparent that the events were not as tidy as\r\n related in these county histories.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Three Maries</strong><br>Unless a specific source is given, the \r\ninformation comes from one or more of the six references noted in the \r\nprevious paragraph. Most of the substantiating data are available on \r\nvarious county web pages within the <a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.com/~nygenweb/\" target=\"_new\">New York</a> \r\nand <a href=\"http://www.pagenweb.org/\" target=\"_new\">Pennsylvania</a> \r\nGenWeb collection.</p>\r\n<p>Marie Jaene d'Ohet (1745 - August 29, 1809 or January 28, 1810) \r\nmarried Hubert d'Autremont, February 3 or 5, 1770, and bore him three \r\nsons, Alexander Hubert, Louis Paul, and Augustus Francois Cecile. Hubert\r\n d'Autremont was guillotined early in the French Revolution. </p>\r\n<p>Marie Genevieve d'Ohet (1752 - August 23, 1834) married Antonine \r\nBartholemy Louie LeFevre (? - February 1, 1830). They had two sons \r\n(Alexander and one who died young) and two daughters (Cecilia and \r\nAugustine). </p>\r\n<p>Of the three Maries, the least is known about Marie Claudine d'Ohet \r\n(1758 - January 10, 1810). She was a nun in France whose convent had \r\nbeen destroyed during the revolution. She moved to Nantes then sailed to\r\n New York in 1806 and came to her sister's home in Angelica. She died \r\nthere January 10, 1810, age 52. </p>\r\n<p><strong>The Voyage</strong><br>On June 19, 1792, Marie Jaene d'Autremont, her \r\nthree sons, and her brother-in-law LeFevre were among a group of \r\nrefugees who sailed with Charles Felix de Boulogne from Le Harve to \r\nPhiladelphia. According to tradition, LeFevre's passport allowed only \r\nhimself, one daughter, and one son to leave the country. The son died \r\nshortly before sailing, so the other daughter was smuggled aboard in his\r\n stead. Marie Genevieve LeFevre and their remaining son, Alexander<sup>7</sup>,\r\n followed two years later. </p>\r\n<p>I searched for Boulogne, d'Autremont, LeFevre, and DuPont in Filby's <em>Passenger\r\n and Immigration Lists Index</em>, but found no record of a 1792 voyage \r\nfrom France to Philadelphia. There is, however, an arrival in 1796 of \r\nLouis Paul d'Autremont<sup>8</sup>. </p>\r\n<p><strong>The Butternut Settlement </strong><br>Charles Felix de Boulogne<sup>9</sup>\r\n is variously termed an agent of the land speculators or the leader of \r\nthe colony in the sources cited. Through his efforts the group acquired a\r\n tract of nearly 25 square miles, purchased in 1792 from patentees \r\nMalachi Treat and the ubiquitous Robert Morris. The best estimate of the\r\n location of this land is the juncture of Butternut Creek and the \r\nUnadilla River in Chenango Co. This junction is today in the town of \r\nGreene, about two miles north of exit 9 on U.S. Interstate 88. Smith \r\n(ref 6) lists LeFevre and Boulogne (but not d'Autremont) as new arrivals\r\n in 1793, as well as Shamont, Bravo, DuVernet, and Obre. Other sources \r\nsay the group, headed by Boulogne, arrived in October 1792.<br><br>This \r\nfirst \"Butternut\" settlement was not successful. Several sources speak \r\nof aristocrats unable to cope with building shelter, planting crops, and\r\n spending a pitiful winter in a drafty one-room log cabin. Their \r\nhardships were compounded by a questionable title to the land, their \r\ninability to make payments, and the death of Boulogne. All of these \r\ncircumstances led to them leaving in 1794 or 1795 to join a more \r\nsuccessful French settlement farther south in Bradford County, PA, \r\ncalled Asylum.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Asylum Settlement and the Return to France<br></strong>On the <a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.com/~usgenweb/pa/bradfop.html\" target=\"_new\">Bradford\r\n County, PA web page</a>, I found a listing for taxables in 1796 \r\ncontaining both Widow d'Autremont and Anthony B. Lafevre, as well as \r\nOliver Dodge. In 1797, middle son Alexander Hubert d'Autremont (March \r\n12, 1776 - April 4 or August 1857), married Abigail, daughter of Major \r\nOliver Dodge of Terrytown, four miles below Asylum on the Susquehanna \r\nRiver.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile in France, Napoleon staged a successful coup d'etat in \r\nNovember of 1799. In 1800, he granted amnesty to the aristocrats who \r\nfled during the Revolution and promised the restoration of their \r\nestates. Many of the &#233;migr&#233;s returned to France. Louis Paul d'Autremont \r\n(November 7, 1770 - 1860), eldest son of Marie, returned to Paris and \r\ntook a wife. He died in 1840, leaving one daughter who married a man \r\nnamed Bridet. Her two sons took their mother's maiden name, d'Autremont \r\nby decree of the Emperor in 1852. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Marie Jaene d'Autremont<br></strong>Marie Jaene d'Autremont reportedly \r\nreturned to the Butternut location in Chenango County with her two \r\nyounger sons. However I found no evidence of her presence. The 1800 \r\nfederal census for Chenango County does contain a record for Alexander \r\nDutrimone in the town of Greene (see table 1). Marie Jaeane d'Autremont \r\nwould have been 55 at the time of the census, her son Alexander would \r\nhave been 24, and her son Augustus Francois Cecile would have been 17. \r\nThe census information shows that, while this household could consist of\r\n Alexander, his wife Abigail, his daughter, his brother Augustus, and \r\none other unknown male, the age of his mother does not match up. I also \r\nfound no d'Autremont, searching several spelling variants, in the 1800 \r\ncensus for Pennsylvania. </p>\r\n<p>In 1806, Marie Jaene apparently bought land from Philip Church on the\r\n western frontier on the Genesee River in Allegany County, town of \r\nAngelica, where she died<sup>10</sup>. </p>\r\n<p><strong>The d'Autremont/Dautrement Sons in Angelica<br></strong>Records for the\r\n two younger d'Autremont sons in Allegany County are relatively \r\nplentiful. The 1808 list of freeholders for the town of Angelica lists \r\nboth Alexander and Augustus Dautrement and here they seemed to settle. \r\nThe naturalization of Augustus (1783 - 1860) is recorded in court \r\nproceedings of June 1809. The Allegany County web site contains a list \r\nof jurors that served between 1807 and 1810. Alexander served October \r\n26, 1808, June 9, 1809, October 24, 1809, January 16, 1810, and June 26,\r\n 1810. Augustus served October 26, 1808 and October 23, 1810. The 1810 \r\ncensus (table 1) lists Alexander Deutremont and Augustus Dautimonte in \r\nAngelica. Alexander would be about 44 years of age, his younger brother \r\nabout 37. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Table 1.

The elder daughter Cecilia \r\nmarried John Prevost in 1815 and died in Wyoming Co., PA in 1876. \r\nAugustine, the younger daughter, married John Huff; they had no \r\nchildren. Anthony Lefevre died February 1, 1830, and his wife, Marie \r\nGenevieve, died August 23, 1834.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The du Pont Connection</strong><br>Victor du Pont de Nemours, son of \r\nPierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours, bought 500 acres in the Church tract \r\nin 1806, the first deed recorded in the county. He became active in \r\nlocal politics and opened a store. Some connection with the d'Autremont \r\nfamily is found in the names of the children. Alexander d'Autremont \r\nnamed a daughter Amelia du Pont (b. 1803), and a sonVictor du Pont (b. \r\n1807). Augustus d'Autremont named a daughter Victorine (b. 1830). Victor\r\n du Pont is listed as one of the freeholders in Angelica in 1808. The \r\nstore reportedly did not prosper and Victor quarreled with the local \r\nsquire, Philip Church. Victor is said to have left Angelica in 1809 to \r\njoin his brother Irenee in Delaware. This tale, however, became tangled \r\nwhen I looked deeper.</p>\r\n<p>The website for the DuPont Company gives a few facts regarding the \r\nfounding of the firm. On July 19, 1802, Eleuthere Irenee du Pont de \r\nNemours purchased property on the Brandywine River and began \r\nconstruction of Eleutherian Mills. On May 1, 1804, DuPont began the \r\nmanufacture and sale of gunpowder. By 1811 DuPont was the largest \r\nmanufacturer of gunpowder in America. </p>\r\n<p>However, in 1810, both brothers were involved as plaintiffs in court \r\ncases in Angelica (Table 4). The 1820 federal census for Delaware lists \r\nan E.J. DuPont in New Castle County, but no Victor. It seems more likely\r\n that the two brothers jointly launched two separate business ventures, \r\none in New York State and one in Delaware. Were it not for the vagaries \r\nof business acumen the DuPont name might have flourished in New York \r\ninstead of Delaware.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Table 4.

He \r\nwas about 90 years old and, as my mother had been born near there, I \r\nthought he might know something about her relatives.</p>\r\n<p>He was not too knowledgeable about my ancestors, but he still told me\r\n something that continues to resonate for me. At the time I was living \r\nnear Cicero, New York, and when I mentioned that fact he became quite \r\nagitated. &#8220;Cicero?&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>&#8220;King&#8217;s Hotel?&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; (King&#8217;s Hotel was a local landmark, now gone.) </p>\r\n<p>&#8220;Filled with ruffians and thieves; I would never go near Cicero.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>It turned out that, as a lad in the 1890s, he had had the task of \r\ndriving a herd of his father&#8217;s cows to market in Utica, New York. \r\nSyracuse would have been much closer, but evidently the price was a \r\nlittle better in Utica. On his return trip, he lodged at King&#8217;s Hotel in\r\n Cicero, and was beset by &#8220;ruffians and thieves&#8221; who stole his father&#8217;s \r\nmoney. Imagine the shame he must have endured when telling his father \r\nthe money was lost. </p>\r\n<p>You can be sure that this old man had told the story all of his life \r\nwhenever he heard the dreaded word Cicero. Well, our traveling ancestors\r\n &#8211; from the seventeenth to the twenty-first centuries &#8211; would have been \r\nswayed by such informal tale-telling.</p>\r\n<p>How did our colonial and post-Revolutionary War New England ancestors\r\n decide to just hitch up their wagons and go into the vast unknown \r\nspaces of the far west (as most of New York beyond Schenectady was \r\nviewed in this period)? At times they would have been influenced by \r\nword-of-mouth, as above, and some times by itinerant ministers and \r\ntravelers who had visited these far-off places.&#160;There are untold numbers\r\n of reasons, but one was most likely decisive. It was the land; always \r\nthe land.</p>\r\n<p>As New York State was opening up for settlers in the 1790s, New \r\nEngland had already been peopled for 150 or more years: the lands had \r\nbeen divided and sold &#8211; or handed down to younger generations through \r\nthe estate process &#8211; more than once. New York State had a large quantity\r\n of excellent farm land, many fast-running streams and rivers, and raw \r\nbuilding materials so plentiful that all one needed were a few hand \r\ntools and a poke of supplies to become established in a new home.</p>\r\n<p>Other than word-of-mouth, what else might have been available to \r\nearly settlers to describe the new country? Gazetteers.</p>\r\n<p>I like to use gazetteers of the time period I am studying to \r\nunderstand the local environment as it appeared to our ancestors. These \r\nlittle books are full of geological and natural history facts, \r\ndescribing the topography, the waterways (superhighways of the day), and\r\n the lakes and settlements as they were at that time. Believe it or not,\r\n these books were not created for genealogists! The data would have been\r\n gathered at some great expense and from myriad sources by the compiler \r\nand then set into book format for the purpose of making money for the \r\npublisher.</p>\r\n<p>And what was the audience for these gazetteers?&#160;It was composed of \r\nsurveyors, land agents, attorneys, land speculators, ministers, \r\ngovernment offices, and libraries, as well as individuals contemplating a\r\n move to a new town. A few gazetteers were created for the state of New \r\nYork. Some later ones were specific to one or two counties, and most of \r\nthe nationwide gazetteers also hold clues to the lands of New York.</p>\r\n<p>The following list is of some New York State gazetteers that you \r\nshould find useful:</p>\r\n<p>(1812)</p>\r\n<p>Spafford, Horatio Gates, A Gazetteer of the State of New York; \r\nCarefully Written from Original and Authentic Materials, Arranged on a \r\nNew Plan, in Three Parts: Comprising, </p>\r\n<p>First &#8211; A Comprehensive Geographical and Statistical View of the \r\nWhole State, Conveniently Disposed Under Separate Reads;</p>\r\n<p>Second &#8211; An Ample General View of Each County, In Alphabetical Order,\r\n with Typographical and Statistical Tables, Showing the Civil and \r\nPolitical Divisions, Population, Post-Offices, &amp;c.;</p>\r\n<p>Third &#8211; a Very Full and Minute Topographical Description of Each Town\r\n or Township, City, Borough, Village, &amp;c. &amp;c., in the Whole \r\nState, Alphabetically Arranged; as also its Lakes, Rivers, Creeks, with \r\nEvery Other Subject of Topographical Detail; Forming a Complete \r\nGazetteer or Geographical Dictionary of the State of New York, with an \r\nAccurate map of the State (Albany: H.

Smith, 1860).</p>\r\n<p>French&#8217;s Gazetteer, as it is commonly called, has a comprehensive \r\nlist of all of the then known early newspapers published in each county,\r\n with dates, titles, and publishers. The footnotes of each county, town,\r\n city, village and hamlet, contain a goldmine of information: names of \r\nthe first settlers, the number and types of churches for each locality, \r\nthe manufacturers and industries. From these descriptions you will gain a\r\n very good feel for the communities, where they traded, and what life \r\nwould have been like from the earliest settlement up to the middle of \r\nthe 19th century.</p>\r\n<p>This book is probably the most used of all of the books in my arsenal\r\n of data tools. When I teach classes on genealogy I usually start out by\r\n telling the attendees to &#8220;Read French&#8217;s Gazetteer from cover to cover, \r\ntwice, and then start your family history research.&#8221; It&#8217;s a joke, of \r\ncourse, but by the time the classes are over they will have heard me \r\nextol the value of French&#8217;s Gazetteer many times. How in the world did \r\nthis man gather so much minutia in the 1850s, most of it is verifiable \r\ntoday, when he had no computer, no Internet, no cell phone, and no \r\nGoogle Books?</p>\r\n<p>The book has a subject index in the front and a geographical index in\r\n the back. A modern, all- personal-name index was created about a \r\nhundred years later by Frank Place of Cortland, New York, and it is \r\nstill available for purchase at the Cortland County Historical Society. \r\nOriginal copies of French&#8217;s Gazetteer are still found in used and \r\nantiquarian book dealers&#8217; inventories, and it has been reprinted several\r\n times; some of those reprints include the all-name index within, and I \r\nbelieve you can find it on CD-ROM as well as online through an easy \r\nsearch engine query. I own originals, reprints, and keep a digital \r\nversion on a thumb drive that I carry around my neck when going out into\r\n the field. I don&#8217;t leave home without it.</p>\r\n<p>There are also county-level gazetteers, created during the 19th \r\ncentury, that are invaluable as research tools &#8211; they will help you \r\ndiscover some little detail that you might otherwise overlook utilizing a\r\n 21st century approach.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other research tips</strong>:</p>\r\n<p>One excellent online catalog to search is WorldCat.org, but be \r\ncreative. Use the Internet search feature and come up with some fabulous\r\n online discoveries. Visit your local genealogical research library and \r\ndig deep for any titles with the word gazetteer in them. Buy reprints or\r\n CD-ROM versions or download digital versions to your own computer, but \r\nby all means remember the word &#8220;Gazetteer!&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>Richard Hillenbrand<br>Upstate New York Genealogy<br><a href=\"http://www.unyg.com/\">http://www.unyg.com/</a></p>\r\n</div></div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/using-new-york-state-gazetteers/", "published": "", "id": 357}, {"author": "Richard Hillenbrand", "country": "New York", "title": "Historical Newspaper Research for New York State Ancestors", "content": "<p>Oh, how we wish that we had early vital records laws in New York \r\nState! </p>\r\n<p>The usual answer to the question of &#8216;When did Vital Records start in \r\nNew York?&#8217; is 1880. There are some exceptions, of course, such as the \r\nfeeble statewide attempt from 1847 to 1849 requiring school teachers to \r\ncollect data on births, deaths, and marriages. The law was not enforced \r\nand the reporting was incomplete. Some cities and local communities \r\nstarted their own record keeping earlier than 1880, but that was not a \r\ncommon occurrence.</p>\r\n<p>A few of those 1847-1849 records are available at county level but \r\nthey are not collected at the state level. The best thing to do is to \r\ncheck the various New York county GenWeb sites to see if those vital \r\nrecords are mentioned, then ask locally at a library or historical \r\nsociety.</p>\r\n<p>You can also use church records, cemetery and gravestone records, tax\r\n lists, land records, court records, estate matters, and census records \r\nto help build a good picture of your family groups.</p>\r\n<p>What we want to discuss here is the importance of using historical \r\nnewspapers to locate data on your family. These are, in my opinion, some\r\n of the best resources to put meat on the bones of your ancestors&#8217; \r\nlives. You will find items of interest in newspaper reports that you \r\nwill never find anywhere else.</p>\r\n<p>All of the social news in small communities might inform you of minor\r\n events in your subjects&#8217; lives that will suggest what their world might\r\n have been like. If you are fortunate, you can find marriage \r\nannouncements, death or funeral news, or estate settlement \r\nannouncements. The inclusion of birth records seems more a twentieth \r\ncentury occurrence. </p>\r\n<p>You might also find are day-to-day events, such as friends from afar \r\nvisiting your forebears. Often these are other family members, and you \r\nmight find clues in the newspapers as to where these people resided. \r\nSuch subjects as property sales or auctions &#8211; even trouble with the law &#8211;\r\n make for interesting reading.</p>\r\n<p>I once located an article about my grandfather&#8217;s first cousin who had\r\n a livery service and was engaged during the winter months to haul a \r\nbody from Syracuse to Lysander, New York. The snow was deep, the horse \r\nran afoul, and sleigh and casket were both damaged; the horse had to be \r\nput down. Can you just image how often that story was told around the \r\nold cracker barrel?&#160; Historical newspapers are a fabulous resource.<br><br>The\r\n New York State Library has been extremely vigilant in locating caches \r\nof old newspapers. The staff there has a very active program called the \r\nNew York State Library Newspaper Project. You may search or browse their\r\n online catalog, and it will help if you know the name of the newspaper \r\nand the date that you are seeking; however, you can also search by \r\ncounty or city to locate newspapers of interest to you.</p>\r\n<p>This catalog is a finding aid to newspapers that are available on \r\nmicrofilm at the NYS Library (or cataloged there); the external \r\nholdings&#8217; location will be noted. One nice feature of this program is \r\nthat almost all of the NYS Library microfilms are available through \r\nInter-Library-Loan (ILL); duplicate copies of the film may be purchased \r\nby the reel.</p>\r\n<p>For a project before 1860, one good resource to check is French&#8217;s New\r\n York State <em>Gazetteer</em>. In the footnotes of each county section \r\nof the <em>Gazetteer</em> is a listing of titles of all of the known \r\nnewspapers, with date ranges and publishers&#8217; names for each of the \r\nstate&#8217;s counties.</p>\r\n<p>You should check various online library catalogs for newspaper \r\nindexes, as quite often individual or groups of historians have read \r\nthrough early issues of old newspapers and created name indexes to \r\npeople and events. For many years this was about the only way we could \r\nfind references to specific items that we could use in our research.</p>\r\n<p>All that has changed in the past few years, as more and more of the \r\ncollections of old newspapers have become available online through the \r\ndigitization of microfilms and optical character recognition (OCR) of \r\nthe text on those newspaper pages. What that gives us is the ability to \r\nindex the complete newspapers to allow for instant computer searching of\r\n all of words and subject phrases.</p>\r\n<p>We are now able to find things almost instantly that would have taken\r\n a virtual lifetime just a few years ago. I can remember being hunched \r\nover for many an hour with my head stuck inside one of those old Readex \r\nmetal monsters and scrolling film page by page.&#160; Computers do miss \r\ncertain things, however. The OCR conversion of pixels to text is not an \r\nexact science yet, but it is a whole lot better than anything else that \r\nhas come along.</p>\r\n<p>Remember, you will want to check local holdings in the area that you \r\nare interested in.&#160; There are times that a small community might have \r\nsome old newspapers in the local historical society or library, and some\r\n of these have never yet been digitized.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>There are also many various compilations of vital records extractions\r\n that have been published from newspapers through the years.&#160; Some \r\ncompilers&#8217; names to search for are: Gertrude A. Barber, Kenneth J. \r\nScott, Fred Q. Bowman, and Mary S. Jackson and Edward F. Jackson. Then \r\nthere are some newspaper extraction programs for various communities, \r\ntowns, cities, counties all through the state. You should ask locally in\r\n the area you are researching, as well as searching various online \r\nlibrary catalog systems. There are unique holdings in Syracuse and \r\nRochester; at the State University of New York in Oswego; and in Wayne \r\nCounty (and within communities all throughout the state). It is best to \r\nask a librarian for guidance. </p>\r\n<p>There are two collections of digitized New York State newspapers that\r\n are online and free to use by anyone. The first is the Northern New \r\nYork Historical Newspapers, provided by the Northern New York Library \r\nNetwork: this is a marvelous selection of newspapers from Oswego, Lewis,\r\n Jefferson, St. Lawrence, Franklin, Clinton, and Essex Counties. Current\r\n holdings offer more than one and a quarter million pages, from \r\nthirty-three different newspapers.</p>\r\n<p>The next site is totally free and is sponsored by one man, Tom \r\nTryniski, at FultonHistory.com. I have featured articles on Tom on my \r\nBlog and I recently wrote an account of an interview with him. His \r\nhobby, as he calls it, has exploded way beyond what one would think of \r\nas a hobby, and his website now has digitized over 6 million pages \r\navailable from newspapers all throughout New York State.&#160; It all started\r\n with a gift of a collection of old postcards of Fulton, New York, which\r\n he put up on the web. Tom recommends reading the FAQ instructions on \r\nthe website to take advantage of Boolean search methods.</p>\r\n<p>As you are reading this on the <em>NewYorkAncestors.org</em> website,\r\n you no doubt are aware of the excellent online resources at the New \r\nEngland Historic Genealogical Society (NEHGS) website, <em>NewEnglandAncestors.org</em>.&#160;\r\n If you have a membership you will be able to access two excellent \r\nonline newspaper databases, the 19th Century U.S. Newspapers and Early \r\nAmerican Newspaper Series (1690-1876). Both of those collections have \r\nvery nice sections on New York State newspapers.</p>\r\n<p>The following resources are all subscription- or membership-based, \r\nand each has its own requirements, so take a look and see which ones \r\nmight be of interest to you. They usually have a free section to look at\r\n or a free trial period so you can get to know the holdings before \r\nsubscribing.</p>\r\n<p>Ancestry.com is one of the early adopters of providing online \r\ngenealogical information.&#160; They now have a very nice collection of \r\nhistorical newspapers online as well as their standard databases of \r\npeople information.&#160; Ancestry also has the online versions of the New \r\nYork Death Newspaper Extracts, 1801-1890, and the New York Marriages \r\nExtracts 1801-1880 compiled by Gertrude Barber.</p>\r\n<p>Footnote.com is a resource that has been growing leaps and bounds \r\nover the last couple of years, and though they first started out by \r\nbuilding a huge digital collection of original manuscript documents at \r\nthe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), they now also \r\noffer very nice holdings of historical newspapers. Their Small Town \r\nPapers Collection is very interesting.</p>\r\n<p>GenealogyBank.com advertises 122 million articles in their collection\r\n of historical newspapers from 1690-1980. Obituaries, marriage notices, \r\nbirth announcements, and other items were published in more than 500,000\r\n issues of over 2,500 titles, with new content being added monthly.</p>\r\n<p>The largest collection of digitized newspapers available online is \r\nthrough NewspaperArchive.com. This company advertises that they have \r\nover 2.84 billion names indexed and more than 949 million articles \r\nregarding 754 cities, covering 240 years and 2,894 titles. Many of these\r\n are New York state newspapers. They do have some free areas of special \r\ncollections that you might want to peruse before subscribing.</p>\r\n<p>One caveat to bear in mind is that newspapers are not considered \r\nprimary source documents, but they are contemporary to the time period \r\nyou are researching. Another thing to consider is that almost all of \r\nthese old newspapers were hand-type set in racks, page by page, printed,\r\n and then the type was broken down, sorted, and put back in the cases.&#160; \r\nThe capital letter type fonts were stored in the &#8220;upper case&#8221; and the \r\nlower case type fonts were stored in the &#8220;lower case&#8221; of the type racks,\r\n all to be used over and over again until they had to be replaced. <br><br>The\r\n way I look at it is, they might not be primary documents, but they sure\r\n will get the juices flowing in your research plan.&#160; Historical \r\nnewspapers open up all kinds of new avenues of pursuit.<br><br><strong>Links\r\n to resources cited:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ancestry.com<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ancestry.com/\">http://www.ancestry.com/</a></p>\r\n<p>Footnote.com (subscription)<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://footnote.com/\">http://footnote.com/</a></p>\r\n<p>FultonHistory.com (free) newspapers online<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fultonhistory.com/\">http://www.fultonhistory.com/</a></p>\r\n<p>GenealogyBank.com<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://genealogybank.com/\">http://genealogybank.com/</a></p>\r\n<p>NewspaperArchive.com (subscription)<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://newspaperarchive.com/\">http://newspaperarchive.com/</a></p>\r\n<p>New York State Library Newspaper Project (free)<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/nysnp/nygcty.htm\">http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/nysnp/nygcty.htm</a></p>\r\n<p>Northern New York Historical Newspapers (free)<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://news.nnyln.net/\">http://news.nnyln.net/</a></p>\r\n\r\nUpstate New York Genealogy, website and Blog (free)<br><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.unyg.com/\">http://www.unyg.com/</a>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/historical-newspaper-research-for-new-york-state-ancestors/", "published": "", "id": 358}, {"author": "Leslie Corn, MA, FGBS ", "country": "New York", "title": "New York City Research Guide, Part One: Vital Records, Property Records, and Estate Records", "content": "<h3><!-- /research/services/articles_authors_lcorn.asp --></h3>\r\n<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\">\r\n\r\n\r\nYou&#8217;ve probably heard.

But it is a complicated and vast storehouse of documents, \r\nmade even more complex by the fact that depending on the part of \r\npresent-day New York City and the time period you want to research, it \r\nis a conglomeration of different systems of record keeping and documents\r\n kept in various repositories. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>In these columns, my goal is to show you how to mine those \r\nrepositories and find what you&#8217;re looking for, whether you research here\r\n in New York City or from a distance, via mail, microfilm, or online, no\r\n matter what your level of expertise, no matter what your ancestry. I&#8217;ll\r\n describe some ins and outs of New York City research. I&#8217;ll tell you \r\nabout lesser-known record groups that might hold the answers you&#8217;re \r\nlooking for when the obvious sources lead nowhere, and where to access \r\ndocuments that substitute for records not yet in the public domain.</p>\r\n<p>Today, New York City is made up of five counties and five boroughs: \r\nNew York County/Borough of Manhattan, Bronx County/Borough of the Bronx,\r\n Kings County/Borough of Brooklyn, Queens County/Borough of Queens, and \r\nRichmond County/Borough of Staten Island. But it wasn&#8217;t always that way.\r\n Depending on the time period of interest, you&#8217;ll need an understanding \r\nof the geography of New York City and surrounding areas to know where to\r\n look for records and what types of records exist. For an excellent \r\ndescription of how New York City was formed, see the article by Harry \r\nMacy, Jr., &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.newyorkfamilyhistory.org/modules.php?name=Sections&amp;op=viewarticle&amp;artid=45\" target=\"new\">Before the Five-Borough City: The Old Cities, Towns and \r\nVillages That Came Together to Form &#8216;Greater New York</a>.&#8217;&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>Records were created by and are kept at various government levels: \r\nfederal, state/county, and municipal. To make matters more challenging, \r\nthe same type of record can be found at different levels, such as \r\nmilitary records and naturalizations. Among the major challenges of New \r\nYork City research is to know what can be found where. We&#8217;ll be \r\ndiscussing that in this column.</p>\r\n<p>Some record groups are the responsibility of the federal government \r\nand are kept in federal repositories, such as federal censuses and \r\nfederal naturalizations. Other records are state holdings and are housed\r\n in county repositories, such as estate and guardianship files and state\r\n censuses. Still other record groups are the responsibility of the \r\nborough, town, or village and are kept in municipal repositories, such \r\nas vital records, the 1890 &#8220;Police Census&#8221; of Manhattan and the Western \r\nBronx, and voter registrations.</p>\r\n<p>There are a couple of reference books I&#8217;d like to recommend at the \r\noutset:</p>\r\n<p><em>Guide to Genealogical and Biographical Sources for New York City \r\n(Manhattan), 1783-1898</em>, by Rosalie Fellows Bailey, AB, FASG. The \r\nbook, originally published in the<em> Register</em>, (vols. 106-8, \r\n1952-54), was reprinted in 1998 by the Genealogical Publishing Co. This \r\npacked little volume of 96 pages, in spite of being outdated here and \r\nthere, is an invaluable resource.</p>\r\n<p>The other book that no New York City researcher should be without is \r\nthe newly updated <em><a href=\"http://www.pictonpress.com/store/show/1873\" target=\"_blank\">Genealogical\r\n Resources in New York</a></em>, edited by Estelle M. Guzik and \r\npublished by the Jewish Genealogical Society, Inc., P.O. Box 286398, New\r\n York, NY 10128. Although the book&#8217;s focus is on late nineteenth- and \r\ntwentieth-century research, there is much for any genealogist interested\r\n in any period of New York City.</p>\r\n<p>My first three columns will feature the New York City Research Guide \r\nand an overview of some major nineteenth-and twentieth-century record \r\ngroups&#8212;civil vital records, property records, estate files, \r\nnaturalization records (federal and state), immigration records, court \r\nrecords (case files, business records, name change petitions, divorce \r\nfiles), records of religious institutions, city directories, censuses \r\n(federal and state censuses, juror censuses, tax lists), cemetery \r\nrecords, military records, and newspapers&#8212;on microfilm, on paper, and \r\nonline. A contact list for the major New York City libraries completes \r\nthe New York City Research Guide. Later columns will feature more \r\nin-depth descriptions of those resources and others from these and \r\nearlier time periods, with explanations of how to search for them.</p>\r\n<p>Addresses and phone numbers are given for every repository mentioned.\r\n If a repository has a website, you can click the hyperlink for more \r\ninformation and order forms, if available, to send for documents. If \r\nyou&#8217;re traveling here, be sure to check into repository hours and \r\nclosings before you visit. For instance, certain repositories are closed\r\n on local election days, and you don&#8217;t want to show up and be \r\nunpleasantly surprised. </p>\r\n<p>Fees and methods of payment (cash, check, money order) are also \r\nsubject to change. Currently, cash is accepted at all of the \r\nrepositories noted below, with the exception of the Office of the City \r\nClerk, where only money orders are accepted. Personal checks can be used\r\n at the New York City Municipal Archives and the National Archives \r\nNortheast-Region (NYC). Be sure to come equipped with change for \r\nphotocopying. Most repositories do not have change machines, and few of \r\nthe copiers accept bills.</p>\r\n<p>When researching in New York City in this post-9/11 world, bring a \r\nphoto I.D. You will need it to gain entrance to every government \r\nbuilding. You will also have to walk through a metal detector and pass \r\nyour bags and outerwear through a scanner. If your cellular phone has a \r\nbuilt-in camera, be prepared to have it taken away for the duration of \r\nyour stay in a New York City courthouse, where cameras are not \r\npermitted.</p>\r\n<p>Look for more in-depth descriptions of records and repositories and \r\nhow-to guides in later columns. The following is an overview of the main\r\n New York City resources of interest to genealogists. It is not meant to\r\n be, nor could it be, an all-inclusive compilation. New York City \r\nresearch being what it is, such an effort would require several volumes.\r\n Because of space limitations, most of the records discussed will be \r\nthose of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. </p>\r\n<p>Many, but by no means all, of the indexes and records of New York \r\nCity repositories can be ordered through the <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Library/FHLC/frameset_fhlc.asp\" target=\"new\">Family History Library</a> and delivered to your local <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Library/FHC/frameset_fhc.asp\" target=\"new\">Family History Center</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CIVIL VITAL RECORDS</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are three major repositories for civil birth, marriage, and \r\ndeath records, all in Manhattan. Depending on the locality of the vital \r\nevent, the <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/home.html\" target=\"new\">New York City Municipal Archives</a> stores birth records \r\nfrom 1847 to 1908, marriage records from 1829 to 1937, and death records\r\n from 1795 through 1948. (Records from the earliest years are extremely \r\nrare.) Later birth and death records, all with restricted access, are \r\nhoused at the New York City Department of Health. Marriage records from \r\n1930 to the present&#8212;with restrictions on records less than fifty years \r\nold&#8212;can be obtained at the Office of the City Clerk of the City of New \r\nYork. </p>\r\n<p>The most complete indexes to vital records can be found at the \r\narchives noted below and also at the <a href=\"http://www.nypl.org/\" target=\"new\">New York Public Library</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.newyorkfamilyhistory.org/\" target=\"new\">New York \r\nGenealogical and Biographical Society</a>, which also has all early \r\nvital records in register format and 1866 death certificates.

But because New \r\nYork City was dissatisfied with the 1890 enumeration of its inhabitants,\r\n the city took its own 1890 census in Manhattan and the western Bronx. \r\nThe enumerators were police officers, and this census became known as \r\nthe \"Police Census.\" Fortunately, most of that enumeration survives. \r\nSearchable by address and listing the names, genders, and ages of New \r\nYork County residents, this municipal census can be viewed on microfilm \r\nat various New York City repositories, and through Family History \r\nCenters.

It&#8217;s quite common to\r\n find someone&#8212;and not just the moneyed folks&#8212;listed in indexes of case \r\nfiles. Order the record and you might discover someone&#8217;s address not \r\nlisted in a city directory or found in a census enumeration, names of \r\nfamily members (perhaps some on the other side of Justice&#8217;s balance), \r\nand insights into ancestors&#8217; lives and personalities. </p>\r\n<p>Business records can include such details as the names and addresses \r\nof the principals, the objectives of the business, and annual reports. </p>\r\n<p>Name change petitions are among the most valuable of genealogical \r\nrecords. They can include such gems as the person&#8217;s original name and \r\ndate of immigration, the parents&#8217; names, and the reason the person \r\nwished to alter his or her name. </p>\r\n<p>There is nothing like divorce files.

If it is no longer extant, its records may be in \r\nthe safekeeping of its successor, a nearby religious institution of the \r\nsame denomination, or in a central repository, such as the Presbyterian \r\nHistorical Society. The New York Genealogical and Biographical Society \r\nLibrary has an <a href=\"http://www.newyorkfamilyhistory.org/modules.php?name=Sections&amp;op=listarticles&amp;secid=3\">extensive\r\n collection of church records</a>. Many church records are also housed \r\nat the <a href=\"http://www.nyhistory.org/\">New-York Historical Society</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The WPA compiled inventories of various churches in New York City \r\nbetween 1939 and 1941, such as the multi-volume <em>Inventory of the \r\nChurch Archives of New York City, 1939-41</em>. These books, also \r\navailable on microfilm through Family History Centers, can tell you the \r\nlocation and extent of records at the time of publication, a brief \r\nhistory of each church, and the names of the clergy.</p>\r\n<p>Some major transcriptions of New York City church records have been \r\ncreated. One of the most extensive is the nine-volume set of \r\ntranscriptions of Trinity Church and Parish, by Hope Cox Lefferts, under\r\n the supervision of John Cox, Jr. The volumes, held by the NYG&amp;B \r\nLibrary, also include transcriptions of the records of Trinity&#8217;s \r\nChapels: St. George&#8217;s, St. Paul&#8217;s, and St. John&#8217;s.</p>\r\n<p>The WPA&#8217;s Historical Records Survey also included synagogues. The \r\ntwo-volume unpublished manuscript, <em>Brooklyn Synagogues</em>, provides \r\ninformation about the records of the synagogues in Brooklyn extant circa\r\n 1940. This manuscript can be found at the <a href=\"http://www.ajhs.org/\">American Jewish Historical Society</a> at \r\nthe Center for Jewish History. </p>\r\n<p>The organizations at the <a href=\"http://www.cjh.org/\">Center for \r\nJewish History</a> have the records of some Jewish congregations, \r\nincluding Congregation Shearith Israel register of marriage \r\ncertificates, 1758-1834 (American Jewish Historical Society, Samuel \r\nOppenheim Collection). But, like the records of churches, most records \r\nof extant synagogues will have to be obtained from the institution \r\nitself.</p>\r\n<p>There are published sources of church records from the seventeenth \r\nthrough the nineteenth-, centuries that can be of immense help to \r\ngenealogists. Among them is Joseph Silinonte&#8217;s <em>Bishop Loughlin's \r\nDispensations, Diocese of Brooklyn: Genealogical Information from the \r\nMarriage Dispensation Records of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn,\r\n Kings, Queens and Suffolk Counties, New York, 1859-66</em>.</p>\r\n<strong>CITY \r\nDIRECTORIES</strong><p>City directories, if researched year after year, can reveal much \r\nabout individuals and families. Along with the individual listings, \r\nwhich include the person&#8217;s name (or, in the case of the 1933-34 \r\ndirectories, the name of the spouse or living companion as well), \r\nbusiness address and residence, city directories can include &#8220;reverse&#8221; \r\ndirectories by street, lists of vital events, ads, maps, informational \r\narticles about the area, and much more. Knowing someone&#8217;s address can be\r\n key to finding other records, such as New York State and municipal \r\ncensuses and tax lists, and using city directories is often the only way\r\n to find an address.</p>\r\n<p>New York City directories were first published in 1786, and, \r\ndepending on the years, also include part or all of what is now the \r\nBronx. Brooklyn directories began ten years later, in 1796. Both sets of\r\n directories continue, with gaps, through the 1933-34 publications. \r\nQueens and Staten Island/Richmond directories (beginning in the 1860s) \r\nare scarcer. </p>\r\n<p>Other types of directories besides residential directories also exist\r\n and can be very helpful to the genealogist. Among them is <em>Doggett&#8217;s \r\nStreet Directory, 1851</em>, the only mid-nineteenth-century &#8220;reverse&#8221; \r\ndirectory. It lists Manhattan occupants by address. Other helpful \r\ndirectories are <em>Phillip&#8217;s Elite Directories</em>, <em>Wilson&#8217;s 1861 \r\nCo-Partnership Directory</em>, occupational directories, and business \r\ndirectories organized by type of business.</p>\r\n<p>Various repositories around New York City contain directories in \r\ntheir collections. The Family History Library has microfilmed many \r\ndirectories as well. </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ancestry.com/\"><em>Ancestry.com</em></a> has some\r\n New York City and Brooklyn directories available online. Scans or \r\ntranscriptions of directories can also be found online at <a href=\"http://www.heritagequest.org/\"><em>HeritageQuest</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.genealogy.com/\"><em>Genealogy.com</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.com/\"><em>RootsWeb</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.genweb.org/\"><em>GenWeb</em></a>, <a href=\"http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa\"><em>Making of America</em></a>, \r\nand other websites.</p>\r\n<p>New York City telephone directories were published beginning in 1878.\r\n Some of the earlier directories also include Brooklyn, Queens, Staten \r\nIsland, and other nearby localities. Few people had telephones until \r\nwell into the twentieth century, but when researching someone with a \r\ngood income who doesn&#8217;t appear in city directories, telephone \r\ndirectories may show where the person lived. Telephone directories can \r\nalso substitute for unpublished city directories in those state census \r\nyears when an address is needed to search for an enumeration.</p>\r\n<p>The final segment of the New York City Research Guide will feature \r\nFederal, and State censuses, tax lists, juror censuses, the 1890 Police \r\nCensus, cemetery records, military records, newspapers, and a list of \r\nmajor New York City libraries.</p>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/nyc-research-guide-pt2/", "published": "", "id": 361}, {"author": "Marian S.

The state&#8217;s vital records do not begin until \r\n1881, but cemetery records can help to fill the gap.&#160; To aid \r\nresearchers, the Association of Municipal Historians of New York State \r\n(AMHNYS) undertook a project in 1997 to survey all of the known \r\ncemeteries in the state.&#160; This inventory, compiled by municipal and \r\ncounty historians, was the first statewide community service project of \r\nAMHNYS.&#160; The result is a three-volume set titled <em>The Association of \r\nMunicipal Historians of New York State Name/Location Survey Project \r\n1995-1997</em> (Heritage Books, Bowie, MD, 1999).&#160; </p>\r\n <p>Historians \r\nwere asked to fill out a survey form for each cemetery in their area.&#160; \r\nThe survey asked for the name or names of the cemetery, the status \r\n(active, inactive, deserted, unknown), type (family, religious, \r\nincorporated, indigent, military, etc.), time frame (year of first and \r\nlast known interments), location, contact person, and any notes.&#160; Family\r\n plots are noted as over or under ten, but it is not clear whether the \r\n&#8220;ten&#8221; refers to the number of surnames or the number of gravesites.&#160; \r\nEntries are listed alphabetically by county, by town within each county,\r\n and by cemetery name within each town.&#160; If you know your ancestor&#8217;s \r\nlocation, this finding aid will tell you which cemeteries were active in\r\n that town or county at the time of death.&#160; Not all of the historians \r\ncontacted returned the survey.&#160; Towns in upstate New York not included \r\nin this publication are listed in a table at the end of this article.</p>\r\n<p>The information content can vary widely from one entry to another.&#160; \r\nLess promising are the cemeteries named &#8220;abandoned&#8221;

If you are searching for burials in \r\nthese towns, this finding aid will be of no use to you.<br></p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\" class=\"contentTableText\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n <td width=\"590\" valign=\"top\" colspan=\"4\" class=\"Normal\"> <p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Albany County</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n <td width=\"148\" valign=\"top\" class=\"Normal\"> <p>Berne</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"148\" valign=\"top\" class=\"Normal\"> <p>Bethlehem</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"148\" valign=\"top\" class=\"Normal\"> <p>Coeymans</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"148\" valign=\"top\" class=\"Normal\"> <p>Green Island</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n <tr>\r\n<td width=\"148\" valign=\"top\" class=\"Normal\"> <p>Guilderland</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"148\" valign=\"top\" class=\"Normal\"> <p>Knox</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"148\" valign=\"top\" class=\"Normal\"> <p>New Scotland</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"148\" valign=\"top\" class=\"Normal\"> <p>Rensselaerville</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n <td width=\"148\" valign=\"top\" class=\"Normal\"> <p>Westerlo</p>\r\n</td>\r\n <td width=\"148\" valign=\"top\" class=\"Normal\">&#160;

Henry", "country": "New York", "title": "New York State Census Records", "content": "<p>The census is one of the first tools a beginning genealogist is introduced to \r\nand remains a workhorse for experienced genealogists.&#160; Using census information \r\nis a basic skill for genealogists.&#160; The experienced genealogist searches all \r\nrelevant census records, including state census records, recognizing that an \r\naging parent or a child who died young may be recorded on only one census.&#160; \r\nFamilies moving into upper New York State in the early nineteenth century were \r\noften transient, passing through the state rapidly on a genealogical time \r\nscale.&#160; In this situation it is doubly important to check all possible \r\ncensuses.&#160; There is a gap in the federal census record due to the loss of the \r\n1890 census.&#160; The 1892 New York State census can help to fill that gap for your \r\nNew York State ancestors.&#160; In this article I discuss what state census records \r\nwere created, how to get to these records, and what information can be gained \r\nfrom each state census.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p><br><strong>What Records Were Created</strong> </p>\r\n<p>Census enumerations for New York State occurred every ten years from 1825 to \r\n1875 and from 1905 to 1925. There is more information in the nineteenth-century \r\nrecords than one usually expects from a census.&#160; In addition to an enumeration \r\nof the population, the state was interested in information about farms and \r\nbusinesses, about churches and newspapers, about marriages and deaths.&#160; If your \r\nancestor lived in the state during this time and owned land, even a few acres, \r\nor a small business such as a gristmill or a cabinet making shop, then you may \r\nfind how many acres he planted in buckwheat and how many sheep he owned, or how \r\nmany people he employed and how much he paid them. </p>\r\n<p>Only one census was taken between 1875 and 1905 &#8211; that of 1892. This census, \r\ndated February 16, 1892, was quite brief.&#160; It asked only name, sex, age, color, \r\nin what country born, citizen or alien, and occupation.&#160; This census gains in \r\nimportance because of the loss in 1921 of the 1890 federal census.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The nineteenth century was a time of flux for the state.&#160; As settlers flooded \r\nin, new counties were established to provide local government.&#160; Thus your \r\nancestor&#8217;s location may change from one census to the next, not because he \r\nmoved, but because a new county was formed.&#160; The following link is to a table of \r\nupstate counties formed after the Revolutionary War. It lists the year the \r\ncounty was formed, the parent county/counties, and the first census in which the \r\ncounty is listed as a separate entity.&#160; The last column lists that part of the \r\nstate census records which are incomplete or missing in the New York State \r\nLibrary in Albany. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Table 1 - Upstate NY Counties Formed After the Revolutionary War \r\n</strong></p>\r\n<strong><br>How to Access the Records </strong><p>Original state census records were stored by county in each county clerk&#8217;s \r\noffice.&#160; Copies of these records were sent to Albany and are today held by the \r\nstate library there.&#160; Public libraries with a local history or genealogy section \r\nfrequently have microfilm copies for their county, and occasionally for \r\nneighboring counties.&#160; You should inquire about interlibrary loan of these \r\nmicrofilms.&#160; All of these collections are probably incomplete; earliest records \r\nwill be hardest to find.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>I searched&#160; the catalog of the Family History Library for 1825 New York \r\ncensus records and found only Washington and Cattaraugus counties.&#160; For the 1835 \r\ncensus only Cattaraugus County is listed.&#160; The NEHGS library catalog lists \r\nindices to the 1855 census of Schenectady and Montgomery counties, but nothing \r\nearlier.&#160; I found no New York State census records in the databases in \r\n<em>Ancestry.com</em>.&#160; County web pages sometimes have census information.&#160; \r\nSchuyler County, for example, was formed in 1854.&#160; Nevertheless, the website \r\noffers 1825 census data for those parts of the county, which, at the time, were \r\nin neighboring counties.&#160; Ontario, one of the oldest upstate counties, offers \r\nindices for 1850-1875 records online at the web page for the county archive.&#160; \r\nThe archive&#160; holds records county records from 1845 to 1925.&#160; County historical \r\nsocieties may be another source of online information. </p>\r\n<p>The remainder of this article details the wealth of information to be found \r\nin these records.&#160; After listing the questions asked on the various censuses, I \r\npresent some examples to show how the state census can enhance the family \r\ninformation obtained from the federal census records.&#160; The most complete record \r\nin the state library is for Steuben County, so I chose that county for my \r\nexamples.&#160; The original census records are held in the county clerk&#8217;s office in \r\nBath.&#160; The collection is not complete.&#160; Only a few towns are present for 1825, \r\nand 1845 is missing entirely.&#160; For my examples I have chosen the family of David \r\nMcMaster, a farmer from Bath.&#160; In addition to David, (born 1796), the household \r\ncontained his wife, Mary, (born 1815), her mother, Abby Humphries, (born 1782), \r\nand at least nine children born between 1829 and 1859. [1] </p>\r\n<strong>Questions for \r\n1825 and 1835 State Census</strong><p>Information from the 1825 census is contained in thirty-six columns.&#160; Columns \r\n1 to 13 do the basic job of a census &#8211; they count people.&#160; Columns 14 to 16&#160;ask \r\nabout marriage, birth, and death.&#160; Columns 17 to 21 are concerned with \r\nagriculture, and columns 22 to 36 with &#8220;domestic manufacturies.&#8221;&#160; The 1835 \r\ncensus was slightly shorter.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Table II - Questions for the 1825 and 1835 New York State Census \r\n</strong></p>\r\n<strong>1855 Census Questions</strong><p>The 1855 census is enormous.&#160; Like the 1850 federal census before it, this is \r\nthe first state census to list by name every member of the household.&#160; Unlike \r\nthe federal census, it also specifies the relationship of each person to the \r\nhead of household.&#160; This census also asks how many years present in this city or \r\ntown, which can help you track your family&#8217;s movements within the state.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The census information requires more than 150 columns.&#160; The population \r\nschedule occupies columns 1-21.&#160; The agriculture section of the second schedule \r\nis the largest section of the census, columns 22-101.&#160; This section is completed \r\nwith questions about Domestic Manufacturies, columns 102-108.&#160; Industry other \r\nthan agriculture is in schedule III, columns 109-125.&#160; Schedule IV contains \r\nlistings of marriages and deaths, columns 126-139.&#160; Schedule V lists churches \r\nand schools.&#160; Schedule VI lists newspapers and other periodicals.&#160; The questions \r\nin columns 1-139 are listed below by schedule. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Table III - Questions for the 1855 New York State Census </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>1865 and 1875 </strong></p>\r\n<p>The 1865 census contains some military service information.&#160; An added \r\nschedule lists the page and line of a person in the census and adds information \r\nsuch as their rank and the unit they are serving with. In the 1875 census the \r\nschedules appear in a different order, marriages and deaths coming before the \r\nagriculture and manufacturing sections.&#160; There is more detail in several \r\nentries.&#160; The section on sheep, columns 141-148, is shown below as an example. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 141 Shorn in 1874 </p>\r\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 142 Shorn in 1875 </p>\r\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 143 Lambs raised in 1874 </p>\r\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 144 Lambs raised in 1875 </p>\r\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 145 Pounds of wool shorn in 1874 </p>\r\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 146 Pounds of wool shorn in 1875 </p>\r\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 147 Sheep slaughtered in 1874 </p>\r\n<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 148 Sheep killed by dogs in 1874</p>\r\n<strong>Questions for \r\n1905, 1915, and 1925 Census</strong> <br><br><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\" class=\"contentTableText\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Permanent Residence </p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>1</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Street</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" colspan=\"4\"><p>house number </p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Name</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>2</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" colspan=\"5\"><p>Name of each person whose usual place of abode on June 1was in this family \r\n</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Relation</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>3</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" colspan=\"5\"><p>relationship of each person to the head of the family </p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Color, Sex and Age </p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>4</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>&#160;color or race </p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>5</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>sex</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>6</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>age at last birthday </p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Nativity</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>7</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" colspan=\"5\"><p>If of foreign birth write name of the country </p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Citizenship</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>8</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Number of years in the united States </p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>9</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Citizen or alien </p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>10</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>&#160;If naturalized when and where </p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Occupation</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>11</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Trade or profession </p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>12</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" colspan=\"3\"><p>class [wages or not] </p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Inmates of Institutions, Infants under one year of age </p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>13</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\" colspan=\"5\"><p>residence when admitted </p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Example: David McMaster, Farmer </p>\r\n<p>In the 1850 federal census we find David McMaster living in Bath with his \r\nwife Mary, six (presumed) children, an older woman named Abby Humphries, and two \r\nother people who may be servants.&#160; The gap in ages of children, David M., age \r\n20, and Adaline, age 6, suggests the possibility of several married daughters or \r\nchildren who died young.&#160; The 1855 state census identifies Abby Humphries as \r\nMary&#8217;s mother, born in Connecticut.&#160; It also gives the county of birth for those \r\nborn in New York State, and states how long they have lived in Bath.&#160; One son, \r\nGreg H.

[3] From information in the 1850 and 1855 censuses about how \r\nlong people were resident in Bath, we expect this 1830 household to contain \r\nDavid McMaster, 26, his wife Mary McMaster, 16, her mother Abby Humphries, 48, \r\nand their eldest son Greg McMaster, 1.&#160; What we find is 1M&lt;5, 1M 30-40, 1F \r\n20-30, 1F 40-50.&#160; The agreement is moderately successful.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The first <u>state</u> census listing the David McMaster household is 1835.&#160; \r\nThis census describes the household as containing 3 males total, 3 females \r\ntotal, 1 male 18-45, 1 male voter, 1 married female under 45, no females 16-45, \r\n1 female unmarried under 16, no marriages, 2 births one male and one female, 2 \r\ndeaths one male and one female, 50 acres of improved land, 6 neat cattle, no \r\nhorses, no sheep, 11 hogs.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>We can account for the three males as the head of household and his two young \r\nsons.&#160; The three females we assign to Mary, her mother, and possibly a daughter, \r\nunmarried, under 16.&#160; The two births and deaths listed occurred during 1835 and \r\nmay indicate babies, perhaps twins, who died young.&#160; We can also see that the \r\nfarm is smaller &#8211; 50 acres of improved land instead of the 92 in 1855. </p>\r\n<p>Even the somewhat skimpy information of the 1892 census can be useful.&#160; In \r\nthis census I find three of the McMaster daughters, apparently unmarried, listed \r\nsequentially in Bath.

Until recently, the index to the state&#8217;s vital \r\nrecords was only available to the public at two locations &#8212; the New York State \r\nArchives in Albany and the National Archives Northeast Region in New York City. \r\nDue in part to the advocacy of this board, a copy of the index to the state&#8217;s \r\nvital records has recently been added to the public library in Rochester as \r\nwell.<sup>2</sup>&#160; This is a concrete example of how a small organization can \r\nhelp make a big difference.&#160;As this index becomes available at more sites, \r\nresearchers will be able to confirm quickly that an event has been recorded.&#160; \r\nSometimes that is all that is needed and months of waiting can be \r\neliminated.</p>\r\n<p>The council has a publications committee chaired by Ruth Metzler.&#160; This \r\ncommittee aims to produce publications that link researchers with sources.&#160; They \r\ntry not to compete with or rework existing guides, but instead choose an area in \r\nwhich the guide is missing. The data collection and writing are done entirely by \r\nNYSCOGO members.&#160; In 1996, NSYCOGO published its <em>Guide to Naturalization \r\nRecords of New York State</em>.&#160; This forty-four-page finding aid contains a \r\nlisting of sites within the state that hold naturalization records.&#160; Listings \r\nare arranged by county, beginning with the year 1790, and a description of the \r\nholdings of each site is included. The publication is available through member \r\norganizations as well as from NYSCOGO itself.&#160; One may obtain a copy by sending \r\na check for $10, plus $3 for shipping and handling, to NYSCOGO, at the address \r\nlisted below.</p>\r\n<p>A guide to Native American records is currently in preparation.&#160; Similar to \r\nthe previous publication, it will describe available sources of Native American \r\ndata of use to genealogists.&#160; It will cover all sixty-two counties including New \r\nYork City.&#160;Work on this publication contains the added twist that tribal \r\nreservations usually have their own historians.&#160; Sensitive to this, NYSCOGO is \r\nconsidering limiting their guide to sources outside of the reservation and \r\nproviding contact information for reservation officials for further details. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>The council&#8217;s quarterly member newsletter, <em>The Lifeline</em>, contains \r\ninformation about upcoming events and local society programs, and includes a \r\ncalendar of events submitted by member organizations.&#160; The calendar also \r\nincludes notices of meetings and conferences for larger organizations, such as \r\nthe Federation of Genealogical Societies and the National Genealogical Society.&#160; \r\nIn addition, <em>The Lifeline</em> publishes other items of news from member \r\norganizations such as: the debut of the Niagara County Genealogical Society \r\nwebsite; a project by the Jefferson County Genealogical Society to inventory \r\nholdings of libraries, museums, etc. in their county; a project by the Western \r\nNew York Genealogical Society to copy nineteenth-century records in their \r\neight-county region; and the twenty-fifth anniversary celebration of the \r\nNortheastern New York Genealogical Society.</p>\r\n<p><em>The Lifeline</em> also publishes original articles of general interest to \r\ngenealogists.&#160; The winter issue of 2000-1 (Vol. 8, No. 32) contains an article \r\nby newsletter editor Joyce H. Cook titled &#8220;State Archives&#8217; New Website an \r\nAward-Winner!&#8221;&#160; In this article we learn that the New York State Archives&#8217; \r\nwebsite <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.archives.nysed.gov/\">http://www.archives.nysed.gov/</a> had received an Ancestry Family \r\nHistory Favorite Award from <em>Ancestry.com</em> .&#160; Details about the content of \r\nthe website and instruction on how to navigate through it are clearly discussed. \r\nThe summer 2001 issue (Vol. 9, No. 2) leads with an article by June Partridge \r\nZintz, the council&#8217;s treasurer, titled &#8220;New Equipment in the FHL in Salt Lake \r\nCity.&#8221;&#160; In this article members are informed, among other changes, of a new \r\ncapability at the Family History Library &#8211; the ability to enhance microfilmed \r\nimages and transfer the image onto one&#8217;s own CD-ROM for&#160;use at home. </p>\r\n<p>NYSCOGO has been building a speakers&#8217; bureau of individuals willing to give \r\npresentations in their area of expertise.&#160; The list of speakers and topics is a \r\nresource available to member organizations for use in planning their individual \r\nmeetings. NYSCOGO holds two meetings each year, one in the spring and another in \r\nthe fall.&#160; These daylong meetings are open to the public.&#160; The location and \r\ntopics vary but the site is usually at or close to an archive or library.&#160; \r\nMembers can combine a personal research trip with the meeting.&#160; Occasionally the \r\nmeetings are held in conjunction with other Society meetings.&#160; The spring \r\nmeeting in May 2001 was held in conjunction with a meeting of the New York \r\nchapter of Palatines to America held in Middleburgh, about thirty-five miles \r\nsouthwest of Albany.&#160; The research sites for this meeting were the Schoharie \r\nCounty Historical Society and the Middleburgh Library.&#160; The fall meeting in \r\nOctober 2001 was part of a two-day conference in Syracuse, marking the fortieth \r\nanniversary of the Central New York Genealogical Society.&#160; This larger event \r\nincluded exhibits and vendors, individual consultations with Diane Snyder Ptak \r\n(of Lineages Unlimited, a family history research business), and several \r\npresentations, including one by John Austin (FAGS, past editor of the \r\n<em>Register</em>).</p>\r\n<p>The 2002 fall meeting was held September 28 at the Oneida County Historical \r\nSociety in Utica, N.Y.&#160; In addition to committee and business meetings, the \r\nfeatured speaker was Frank Tomaino, author of <em>History: Just for the Fun of \r\nIt,</em> and co-author of <em>Mom and Pop Grocery Stores of Oneida County</em>.&#160; \r\nHis talk was titled &#8220;Early Oneida County History, Especially Some of Its Most \r\nFamous Sons &amp; Daughters.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>NYSCOGO members include genealogical societies, historical societies, \r\narchives, family lineage groups, and libraries, as well as interested \r\nindividuals. Ten years after it was founded NYSCOGO membership was evenly split \r\nbetween individual members and organizational members &#8211; over thirty of each.&#160; \r\nOrganizations designate two members to act as delegates to attend meetings and \r\nto transmit NYSCOGO information to their societies.&#160; Dues are $10 for \r\nindividuals and $25 for organizations.&#160; NYSCOGO can be reached at PO Box 2593, \r\nSyracuse, NY, 13220-2593.</p>\r\n<div><br clear=\"all\"><hr size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" align=\"left\">\r\n<sup>1.Presented verbatim from the membership brochure.</sup><br><br><sup>2.This \r\nsite was the subject of a </sup><sup><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/research/services/articles_easier_obtain_newyork_vital.asp\">previous \r\narticle</a>&#160;in this series.&#160; The public library in Syracuse also recently \r\nobtained a copy of the VR index.</sup></div></div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/new-york-state-council-of-genealogical-organizations/", "published": "October 4, 2004", "id": 364}, {"author": "Marian S. Henry", "country": "New York", "title": "New York State Vital Records: The Legacy of Gertrude Audrey Barber", "content": "<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\r\n<p>Trying to find nineteenth-century vital records in upstate New York can be a \r\nfrustrating experience.&#160; Fortunately, we have an ally in Gertrude Audrey Barber \r\nwho made it her life&#8217;s work to transcribe vital records information from \r\ndifferent sources in various counties in New York State.&#160; Beginning in the late \r\n1920s and continuing for nearly 40 years, Barber painstakingly transcribed many \r\nkinds of nineteenth-century records useful to genealogists.&#160; Using original \r\ncounty court records she prepared extracts of deeds and abstracts of wills.&#160; She \r\nmade transcriptions of church records and visited cemeteries to copy gravestone \r\ninscriptions.&#160; She extracted marriage and death notices from local newspapers. \r\nIn this article we look at how upstate New York researchers could benefit from \r\nthe legacy left by Gertrude Barber. The type of information she transcribed for \r\neach county and the time period covered are listed below. Suggestions are \r\nincluded for accessing the information since these typewritten transcriptions \r\nwere not published in book form. Little information is readily available about \r\nthis woman who worked for so long for the benefit of New York State genealogy.&#160; \r\nHer obituary in the <em>New York Times</em> of December 17, 1974, reads simply: \r\n\"Barber &#8212; Gertrude A., Genealogist, Widow of Williard Barber, died suddenly, \r\nDec. 12, at age 83. Interment private.\"<br><br><strong>Wills</strong></p>\r\n<p>Gertrude Barber prepared abstracts and/or an index of wills for the following \r\ncounties: Cayuga, Chemung, Chenango, Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Greene, \r\nMonroe, Oneida, Otsego, Rockland, Schenectady, Schoharie, Sullivan, Tioga, \r\nTompkins, Warren, and Washington.&#160; Many of these transcriptions are in several \r\nvolumes and include surname indexes. A more complete listing is in the summary \r\ntable at the end of this article.&#160; The description of her abstracts of wills for \r\nColumbia County, which was published in <em>The New York Genealogical and \r\nBiographical Record</em> (Vol. LXVII, 1936, page 190), will serve to illustrate \r\nwhat is contained in this collection.&#160; &#8220;An indexed abstract of wills is always a \r\nmost helpful publication for genealogists.&#160; It is the names mentioned in the \r\nwill, rather than the names of the testators themselves, of which the searcher \r\ndesires to be made aware.&#160; The author has here made the first of such \r\ncompilations, concerning Columbia County, available to the public. The wills \r\nhave been completely abstracted and thoroughly indexed.&#160; Fifty pages of the \r\nmanuscript set forth the abstracts of the will and nearly as many pages are \r\ntaken up with the valuable index. Genealogical libraries collecting manuscript \r\nmaterial should have this one in their files.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Church and Cemetery Records</strong></p>\r\n<p>Barber&#8217;s transcriptions of church records consist of extracts of birth, \r\nbaptism, marriage, or death information. Individual churches are listed under \r\neach county in the table below.&#160; Although other counties are represented, \r\nSullivan County predominates in her transcriptions of church records. (Those \r\nseeking early church records are reminded of the previous column concerning the \r\nVosburgh Collection.) </p>\r\n<p>Barber&#8217;s efforts in copying tombstone inscriptions are especially valuable.&#160; \r\nAs tombstones weather over time, these original records become increasingly \r\nillegible and transcriptions are all we have left.&#160; Information was collected \r\nfrom cemeteries in Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Columbia, Erie, Orange, \r\nOtsego, Rockland, Schoharie, Sullivan, and Wyoming counties.&#160; Individual \r\ncemeteries are listed by county in the table.&#160; Some of these items are quite \r\nextensive, such as &#8220;Gravestone Inscriptions in Columbia County, New York.&#8221;&#160; It \r\noccupies 12 volumes and was released in stages from 1935 to 1941. (The finding \r\naid &#8220;The Association of Municipal Historians of New York State Name/Location \r\nSurvey Project 1995&#8211;1997,&#8221; the subject of a previous article, may be helpful in \r\nlocating these cemeteries.)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Newspaper Extracts</strong></p>\r\n<p>Collections of vital records extracted from newspapers include such items as \r\n&#8220;Deaths and Marriages taken from Cayuga County, N.Y. newspapers, 1825&#8211;1834&#8221; and \r\n&#8220;Marriages and deaths taken from the <em>Delaware Gazette</em> at Delhi, Delaware \r\nCounty, N.Y.&#8221;&#160; This newspaper was apparently published weekly.&#160; Issues with no \r\nmarriages are entered with &#8220;none&#8221; rather than skipped, an indication of the \r\nauthor&#8217;s care taken to produce complete, reliable results.&#160; Several more \r\nexamples are included in the table.&#160; (An even more extensive collection of vital \r\nrecords extracted from early newspapers may be found in the work of Fred Q. \r\nBowman, the subject of a previous article.)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Accessing the Collection</strong></p>\r\n<p>Barber&#8217;s typewritten transcriptions were usually deposited in the library of \r\nthe New York Genealogical and Biographical Society in New York City.&#160; Members of \r\nthe &#8220;G&amp;B&#8221; will find her work there.&#160; Most have been microfilmed and today \r\nare available at many major genealogical libraries.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>NEHGS lists 30 items in its catalog, including some relating to downstate \r\ncounties not included here.&#160; Of these, 25 are listed in the Circulating Library \r\ncatalog, making them readily available to members. Her transcriptions of \r\nmarriage and death notices from the <em>New York Evening Post</em>, 1801&#8211;1890 \r\nare among the searchable databases available on the Society&#8217;s website.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.archives.nysed.gov/aindex.shtml\" target=\"new\">New York \r\nState Archives</a> at Albany lists 120 items authored by Gertrude Barber &#8211; a \r\nvery complete collection.&#160; The Archives participates in the national \r\ninter-library loan network, which allows researchers to borrow microfilm for use \r\nin their own public library. Similarly, the <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Library/FHLC/frameset_fhlc.asp\" target=\"new\">Family History Library catalog</a> lists 119 entries, including many \r\nmicrofilms that may be borrowed for use at local Family History Centers. The <a href=\"http://www.dar.org/library/onlinlib.cfm\" target=\"new\">online catalog</a> of \r\nthe National Library of the National Society of the Daughters of the American \r\nRevolution in Washington, D. C. contains 39 entries.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Public libraries in upstate New York may hold some of this material.&#160;Results \r\nwill vary. The public library for Monroe County, in Rochester, New York, lists \r\n48 items authored by Gertrude Barber.&#160;However, the online catalog for all 50 of \r\nthe public libraries in the Southern Tier Library system lists none.</p>\r\n<p>The following table lists works related to 21 upstate counties including, \r\nwhen known, the time period covered for each item.&#160; For cemetery transcripts the \r\ndate of publication is given. The table below, while extensive, is far from a \r\ncomplete record of the work of Mrs. Barber.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Transcriptions Compiled by \r\nGertrude Barber Relevant to Upstate New York<br><br></strong></p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\" class=\"contentTableText\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>County</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>Title</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Allegany</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Cemetery records of Allegany County, New York.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Cattaraugus</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Cattaraugus County, N.

Henry ", "country": "New York", "title": "New York's Failed Annexation of Vermont", "content": "<p>Those with eighteenth-century ancestors in Vermont may not \r\nrealize that those ancestors were once New Yorkers (well, almost). And some New \r\nYorkers who obtained patents for land now in Vermont, never actually possessed \r\ntheir land. In the years preceding the Revolutionary War, the governors of both \r\nNew Hampshire and New York, engaging in a spot of land speculation, were each \r\ndispensing grants for the same land. The vigilante group known as the Green \r\nMountain Boys, led by Ethan Allen, rather rudely dispatched New York surveyors \r\nsent in to establish boundaries in existing settlements. Consequently, the Green \r\nMountain Boys were declared outlaws and had a price on their heads. Vermont \r\nfinally acted on its own and seceded&#8212;from New York, from New Hampshire, and from \r\nthe Confederation of the United States. Read on. \r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>The Treaty of Paris in 1763 ended the conflict known in Europe as the Seven \r\nYears' War and in North America as the French and Indian War. <sup>1</sup>As a \r\nresult of this treaty the territory, which would eventually become Vermont, \r\npassed out of French control. New Hampshire considered territory west of the \r\nConnecticut River and south of Canada to be a part of that colony and the region \r\nbecame known as the \"New Hampshire grants.\" The first royal governor of New \r\nHampshire, Benning Wentworth <sup>2</sup>, was appointed in 1741. In 1749 he \r\ngranted the town of Bennington, six miles square on the western border of New \r\nHampshire, and by 1754 he had granted fifteen townships. As of 1761, sixty \r\ntownships, each six miles square, had been granted on the west side of the \r\nConnecticut River. Wentworth collected a sizable &#163;20 fee from each grantee, of \r\nwhich there were sixty per town. He also reserved 500 acres in each township for \r\nhimself. When he resigned the office in 1766 to his nephew John, Benning \r\nWentworth had become a very wealthy man. </p>\r\n<p>Not to be outdone in the land speculation game, the governor of New York, \r\nRobert Mouckton, had also been granting the same land as part of the county of \r\nAlbany. His claim to the territory was the grants by Charles II to the Duke of \r\nYork in 1664 and 1674. On December 28, 1763, Cadwallader Colden, acting governor \r\nof New York, issued a proclamation claiming all the land west of the Connecticut \r\nRiver for New York, annulling the grants made previously by Benning Wentworth. \r\nWentworth replied with a proclamation on March 13, 1764, declaring the grant to \r\nthe Duke of York to be obsolete. New York submitted a petition to the Privy \r\nCouncil in London purported to be signed by settlers on the New Hampshire grants \r\nwanting the western bank of Connecticut River established as the eastern \r\nboundary of New York. (Subsequent action makes one wonder who did sign this \r\npetition.) Surprisingly, on July 20, 1764, the Crown so ordered. </p>\r\n<p>The matter might have ended there if the New Hampshire grants had simply been \r\ntransferred to the jurisdiction of New York, and if the original settlers had \r\nbeen confirmed in their claims. However, New York insisted that the decree was \r\nretroactive. In this view all of the settlers' claims were invalid. If the \r\nsettlers wanted to keep farms they had labored to carve out of the wilderness, \r\nthey were required to buy them again from New York. New Hampshire did not press \r\nits claim, but the settlers resisted the \"Yorkers\" firmly. In 1766 they \r\nappointed Samuel Robinson of Bennington as their agent to represent them in the \r\nCourt of Great Britain. </p>\r\n<p>As a display of authority, New York erected Cumberland County to include land \r\nin the New Hampshire grants on July 2, 1766. The Crown annulled this act on June \r\n26, 1767, and a month later ordered that the governor of New York could make no \r\nmore grants. New York ignored this and again passed legislation to form the \r\ncounty. </p>\r\n<p>In October of 1767, the settlers' representative, Samuel Robinson, died of \r\nsmallpox in London. Nevertheless, the settlers continued their local resistance. \r\nEthan Allen and his brother Ira defended those taken to court for eviction. They \r\nlost in court, but continued to resist and formed associations, some of them \r\nmilitary. Ethan Allen was appointed \"Colonel Commandant\" and Seth Warner, Robert \r\nCochran, Gideon Warner, and Allen's cousin Remember Baker were appointed \r\nCaptains. Surveyors from New York were met with a \"reception committee\" of Green \r\nMountain Boys armed with guns, clubs, and stones. Zadeck Thompson \r\n<sup>3</sup>describes the scene when the sheriff of Albany County attempted to \r\nserve writ on James Breckenridge, a farmer in Bennington. </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>\"Whenever the sheriff appeared upon the grants for the purpose of arresting \r\nrioters, or ejecting the settlers, he was sure to be met by a party larger than \r\nhis own, fully determined to frustrate his object. Being required to serve a \r\nwrit of ejectment on James Breckenridge, the sheriff, by order of the governor, \r\ncalled to his assistance a posse of 750 armed militia. [John Pell \r\n<sup>4</sup>claims a more realistic posse of 150.] The settlers having timely \r\nknowledge of his approach, assembled to the number of about 300, and arranged \r\ntheir plans to resist him. An officer with 18 men was placed in the house, 120 \r\nmen behind trees near the road by which the sheriff must advance, and the \r\nremainder were concealed behind a ridge of land within gun shot of the house; \r\nand the forcing the door by the sheriff was to be made known to those concealed \r\nwithout by raising a red flag at the top of the chimney.<br>\"When the sheriff \r\napproached all were silent, and he and his men were completely within the \r\nambuscade before they discovered their situation. Mr. Ten Eyck, the sheriff, \r\nwent to the door, demanded entrance as sheriff of the county of Albany, and \r\nthreatened, on refusal, to force it. The answer from within was, 'attempt it, \r\nand you are a dead man.' On repeating this demand, with a threat of using force, \r\n&#8230; the two divisions exhibited their hats on the points of their guns, which made \r\nthem appear much more numerous than they really were. The sheriff and his posse \r\nseeing their dangerous situation, and not (says Ira Allen) being interested in \r\nthe dispute, made a hasty retreat, without a shot being fired on either side.\" \r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Remember Baker was once arrested from his home, and he, his wife, and small \r\nson were wounded. Thompson <sup>5</sup>, flaunting his bias against New York, \r\ndescribes the event thus: </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>\"Having assembled ten or twelve of his friends and dependants, on the 22d of \r\nMarch, 1772, before daylight, being Sunday morning, he [John Munro] proceeded to \r\nthe house of Remember Baker in Arlington for the purpose of arresting him. Baker \r\nwas awakened by the breaking open of his door, and the entrance of a number of \r\nmen armed with swords and pistols. The intruders rushed upon him with savage \r\nfury, wounding him by a cut across the head, and also on the arm, with a sword. \r\nHis wife too was barbarously wounded by a sword cut across the head and neck, \r\nand one of his boys also, then about 12 years old. Baker being overpowered and \r\nbound was thrown into a sleigh and conveyed off with the greatest speed towards \r\nAlbany. The news of this transaction being sent by express to Bennington, ten \r\nmen immediately mounted their horses for the purpose of intercepting the \r\nbanditti and rescuing Baker. They came upon Munro and his party just before they \r\nreached the Hudson River, who on the first appearance of their pursuers \r\nabandoned their prisoner and fled. Baker was found nearly exhausted by his \r\nsufferings and the loss of blood. Having refreshed him and dressed his wounds, \r\nthey carried him home to the no small joy of his friends and the whole \r\nsettlement.\" </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Not surprisingly, the new governor of New York, Sir William Tryon, issued a \r\nproclamation outlawing Ethan Allen and eight of his men, and offering a bounty \r\nof &#163;60 for the capture of their leader. Ethan Allen responded by offering a \r\nbounty of &#163;25 for any of the officials involved. </p>\r\n<p>At a convention in Westminster on January 15, 1777, Vermont was born. The \r\ndelegates proclaimed \"that the district or territory comprehending, and usually \r\nknown by the name and description of the New Hampshire grants, of right ought to \r\nbe, and is hereby declared forever hereafter to be, a free and independent \r\njurisdiction, or state; to be forever hereafter called, known, and distinguished \r\nby the name of New Connecticut, alias Vermont.\" At the time Massachusetts, \r\nConnecticut, and New Hampshire were all willing to admit Vermont into the \r\nnascent United States, then involved in the Revolutionary War. New York was not. \r\nCongress dismissed Vermont's petition to send delegates and Vermont replied by \r\ndrafting its constitution. </p>\r\n<p>Perhaps even at this stage New York might have won the day. In 1782, Governor \r\nClinton released a proclamation repealing the acts of outlawry and confirming \r\nthe settlers in their land if they would stay in New York. However, Ethan Allen, \r\nnewly released from British prison during the war, had the last word in his \r\nopposing proclamation. \"The overtures in the proclamation set forth are either \r\nromantic or calculated to deceive woods people, who, in general may not be \r\nsupposed to understand law, or the power of a legislative authority ... You have \r\nexperienced every species of suppression, which the old government of New York, \r\nwith a Tryon at its head, could invent and inflict; and it is manifest that the \r\nnew government are minded to follow nearly in their steps. Happy is it for you \r\nthat you are fitted for the severest trials! You have been wonderfully supported \r\nand carried through thus far in your opposition to that government. Formerly you \r\nhad every thing to fear from it, but now little; for your public character is \r\nestablished and your cause known to be just. In your early struggles with that \r\ngovernment, you acquired a reputation for bravery; this gave you a relish for \r\nmartial glory, and the British invasion opened an ample field for its display, \r\nand you have gone on conquering and to conquer until tall grenadiers are \r\ndismayed and tremble at your approach.\" New York's attempt at reconciliation was \r\nseen as too little too late. </p>\r\n<sup>1.

The most useful items for a family historian are the land \r\ntables.&#160;The land tables take up only three full reels and two partial \r\nreels out of a total of 202 reels.&#160;They allow a researcher to connect a \r\nname with a location and a date.&#160; The general agent of the company \r\ncompiled this information from annual reports of local agents.&#160; Each \r\nagent was required to send a list of all land transactions to the \r\ngeneral agent.&#160; Each entry names the person, the location, the date, and\r\n the details of the transaction.&#160; Karen Livsey extracted these \r\nmicrofilmed records [3] for her two-volume work titled<em> Western New \r\nYork Land Transactions</em>. </p>\r\n<p>The following example shows how to use this finding aid.&#160; In outline,\r\n one looks for a name in the index of the book, locates the appropriate \r\nextracts in the body of the book, uses the first table appended to this \r\narticle to determine which microfilm reel contains the transaction \r\ninformation, and uses the second appended table to &#8220;translate&#8221; the \r\ntownship/range designation to a present-day county/town location. </p>\r\n<p>Nehemiah Sayer is the first name in Volume I, so I chose that for our\r\n example.&#160; In the index to Volume I the name occurs five times, each \r\ntime at the same location.&#160; The five corresponding extracts are as \r\nfollows.</p>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\" class=\"contentTableText\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>Name</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>Date</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>Lot</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>S T R</strong> </p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>D</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>Ref-page</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Nehemiah Sayer</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>21 Sep 04</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>2</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>060501</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>s</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>484-0002</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Nehemiah Sayer</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>21 Jun 03</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>2</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>060501</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>o</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>484-0016</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Nehemiah Sayer</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>26 Jun 06</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>2</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>060501</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>s</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>484-00#8</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Nehemiah Sayer</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>1 Feb 13</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>2</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>060501</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>s</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>490-0033</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Nehemiah Sayer</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>4 May 13</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>2</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>060501</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>s</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>491-0032</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div><p>Column &#8220;STR&#8221; lists section, township, and range, which specifies the \r\nlocation.&#160; Column &#8220;D&#8221; indicates the type of transaction.&#160; In this case, \r\n&#8220;o&#8221; means original contract issued, and &#8220;s&#8221; indicates subsequent \r\ntransactions.&#160; The column &#8220;Ref-page&#8221; lists the inventory item number of \r\nthe land table folder or volume and the page number within the volume.&#160; \r\nFrom this table of extracted entries we already know that Nehemiah Sayer\r\n originally contracted for lot 2 in section 6 of township 5, range 1 on \r\nJune 21, 1803. The details of this transaction are to be found on page \r\n16 of item #484. We do not know from this entry when he actually \r\noccupied the site.&#160; However, he had additional dealings with the local \r\nagent concerning this lot on September 21, 1804, June 26, 1806, February\r\n 1, 1813, and May 4, 1813.&#160; It is likely that these transactions \r\ninvolved additional payments.&#160; Deeds to the land were not issued until \r\nfinal payment was made.<br><br>From Table I below we find that item #484\r\n is on reel 109 (FHL film number 1,414,983) and items 490 and 491 are \r\nboth on reel 110 (FHL film number 1,414,984).&#160; From Table II we find \r\nthat township 5, range 1 is in the town of Caneadea in Allegany County.&#160;\r\n This gives a fairly precise location to begin searching tax lists, \r\nchurch records, census records, and other sources.&#160; The table also \r\nindicates that the first contract in T5R1 was written in 1803, making \r\nNehemiah Sayer one of the earliest settlers in the region.&#160; Allegany \r\nCounty was created in 1806 from Genesee County.&#160; We would therefore look\r\n for the Nehemiah Sayer household in Genesee County in the 1800 federal \r\ncensus and in Allegany County in the 1810 census.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Table I.

Dutchess County \r\nis located about sixty miles north of New York City, between the state of \r\nConnecticut and the Hudson River. While genealogical records in New York can be \r\nscarce,[1] an unusual amount of genealogical material can be found about the \r\nthirteen hundred or so families who came to the Beekman Patent in the eighteenth \r\ncentury. </p>\r\n<p><strong>The patents</strong><br>The Beekman Patent, and other land grants, \r\nwere a direct result of concerns by the British Crown that their newly acquired \r\nprovinces in the New World were about to be taken over by the French. On August \r\n27, 1664, the English overthrew the Dutch in New Amsterdam and renamed the city \r\nNew York, and on September 24, 1664, Fort Orange was renamed Albany. The \r\ngovernor of New York established twelve counties on November 1, 1683, including \r\nDutchess. Just a few years later, on February 8 and 9, 1690, the French and \r\nIndians staged a raid against the Dutch and English settlers in Schenectady and \r\nkilled approximately sixty people, including ten women and twelve children. The \r\nEnglish realized that to keep their land they had to establish a presence in the \r\nnew colony and began awarding large land grants, called patents, to \r\nentrepreneurs who would develop the land and establish farms.The first such patent in \r\nDutchess County was actually granted before the county was established. On \r\nFebruary 8, 1682, Francis Rombout and Gulian Ver Planck received a patent for \r\neighty-five thousand acres of land that today comprise the towns of Fishkill, \r\nWappingers, East Fishkill, and parts of Poughkeepsie.This acreage became the \r\nRombout Patent. Other patents were granted as early as April 22, 1697, and as \r\nlate as April 10, 1706. The Philipse Patent was granted June 16, 1697, to Adolph \r\nPhilipse and today is Putnam County. The boundaries and locations of the Beekman \r\nand Philipse Patents were the cause of significant problems in the mid to late \r\neighteenth century.<br><br><em>Above: Map of Dutchess County, New York, showing \r\nboundaries of the original patents and the current townships that were erected \r\nfrom them.</em></p>\r\n<p><img align=\"right\" title=\"Frank J.

Henry Beekman for two tracts of land in Dutchess County. \r\nBecause the boundaries of the smaller patent in the Rhinebeck area were vague, \r\nnew patents were issued June 25, 1703. The Beekman Patent, the subject of this \r\narticle, was located in the southeast corner of present Dutchess County and was \r\nbounded on the south by the Philipse Patent, on the east by the Oblong (which \r\nincludes Quaker Hill), on the north by the Great Nine Partners Patent, and on \r\nthe west by the Rombout Patent. It was about fifteen miles from north to south, \r\nand about fifteen miles wide on the north and five and one-half miles wide on \r\nthe south &#8212; a total of about 100,800 acres of land.</p>\r\n<p>Col. Henry Beekman died in 1716. At that time there were few, if any, \r\nsettlers in the Beekman Patent, called the &#8220;back lots.&#8221; However, after about \r\n1713 a number of Palatines and others had started to settle in his Rhinebeck \r\nPatent. Within ten or eleven years after his father&#8217;s death, Henry Beekman, Jr., \r\nson of the patentee, encouraged some of these families to move into the larger \r\nBeekman Patent, at first mostly into the Clove Valley area which his father had \r\ngiven him on May 6, 1713. The first to settle were the Emighs and the Uhles, \r\nboth Palatines. The stone house built by Nicholas Emigh still stands today as a \r\nmemorial to the earliest farmers in the Beekman Patent.</p>\r\n<p><img align=\"right\" title=\"Great Nine\" alt=\"Great Nine\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/New_York/great_ninelg.jpg\">After the death of Col. Henry Beekman, Sr., and his wife Johanna Loper,[2] \r\nthe patent was divided into twenty-three lots among his three surviving \r\nchildren: Col. Henry Beekman, Jr.; Catherine, who married first Cornelis Exveen, \r\nsecond John Rutsen, and third Albert Pawling (the town of Pawling is named in \r\nher honor); and Cornelia, who married Gilbert R. Livingston. A map of the \r\ndivision was drawn about 1738 and helps in locating where the early settlers \r\nestablished their farms (see map above). In the same year the several patents in \r\nthe county were convertedinto precincts, and the Beekman Patent became Beekman \r\nPrecinct. The present towns of Beekman, Dover, Pawling, Union Vale, and about \r\none-half of LaGrange were erected from the Beekman Precinct.[3]</p>\r\n<p><strong><img align=\"left\" title=\"Beekman Quote\" alt=\"Beekman Quote\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/New_York/beekman_quote.jpg\">Tenancy</strong><br>Henry Beekman sold land to the very \r\nearliest settlers, including the Emighs, Uhles, and a few others, but by 1740 he \r\nand his sisters (and their husbands) began leasing all the farms and collecting \r\nrents in the form of &#8220;good sweet merchantable winter wheat,&#8221; &#8220;live fat hens,&#8221; \r\nand, usually, &#8220;a day&#8217;s work with plow or sleigh.&#8221; The annual rent for the \r\naverage farm of two hundred acres was twenty bushels of wheat and two hens, plus \r\na day&#8217;s work.The writer lives on a part of one of the smaller farms, originally \r\nsixty acres, that called for rent of only two fat hens, but the tenant, a poor \r\nPalatine, rarely made his rent payments.[4] Several writers have noted that the \r\nleasehold system was very beneficial to a poor emigrant farmer starting out. He \r\nwas able to acquire wealth without any initial capital except his own labor and \r\ncould sell his farm, excepting the dung heap and less a ten percent fee to the \r\nlandlord, and move to another tenant farm or (as happened frequently after about \r\n1762) north to Halfmoon or other land near Albany to purchase a farm.</p>\r\n<p>The lease system, while negating the existence of deeds and mortgages for \r\nmost of the eighteenth century, turned out to be a boon for genealogists because \r\nof the threelife leases. Henry Beekman and his siblings leased almost all land \r\nwith a three-life lease, frequently with provision for an extra life to be added \r\nupon payment of &#163;10. Each lease would include the names, and often the ages, of \r\nat least three members of the family.[5] Usually the lease would be for the \r\nlives of the husband and his wife and a child (frequently a very young child), \r\nbut leases were also given for the lives of brothers, of a man and his wife and \r\nher brother, or of seemingly unrelated people. By inserting the name of a very \r\nyoung child, the tenant attempted to preserve the family farm for as many years \r\nas possible.We have found one lease for 999 years, but in practice most tenants \r\ngave up the lease in less than twenty years and moved on. Locating original \r\nlease ledgers kept by the three landlords for much of the property in the patent \r\nhas provided a wealth of genealogical information for an otherwise difficult \r\narea of study.</p>\r\n<p>Gilbert R. Livingston kept a record of his tenants in &#8220;The Rhinebeck Rent \r\nBook,&#8221; which has been preserved in the manuscript division of The New-York \r\nHistorical Society in New York City. His lots are noted on the plat as &#8220;C. \r\nLivingston&#8221; for his wife Cornelia (Beekman) Livingston. Catherine Beekman kept a \r\nless expansive record of her tenants in the Dutch language and very few actual \r\nleases have been located for these families. Col. Henry Beekman, Jr., kept very \r\nextensive records of his tenants, not only in Beekman but also elsewhere in New \r\nYork, and these ancient ledgers were deposited about fifteen years ago in the \r\nFirestone Library at Princeton University.[6]</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Quakers and the Oblong</strong><br>The Oblong is a tract of land \r\nthe boundaries of which were disputed between the colonies of Connecticut and \r\nNew York for many years &#8212; until a settlement was reached at the Treaty of Dover \r\non May 14, 1731. As a result of this treaty, the eastern bounds of Dutchess \r\nCounty were extended one mile and three-quarters and twenty rods on December 17, \r\n1743, and the later towns of Dover and Pawling are larger than the original \r\npatent would indicate. The land in the Oblong could be purchased from the \r\ndevelopers, and many Quakers from Dartmouth and Rhode Island began settlement as \r\nearly as 1740 and established meeting houses on the Oblong and in the Patent. \r\nNathan Birdsall, a Quaker from Long Island, New York, was one of the first \r\nsettlers on the Oblong, but most settlers came from New England.One of the \r\nearliest meetings in the Patent itself was in the present town of Union Vale and \r\nthe area was called Oswego, which has led to considerable confusion. The Quakers \r\n(Friends) kept extensive records of births, marriages, removals (to another \r\nmeeting), and often deaths as well.</p>\r\n<p><br><img align=\"left\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/New_York/beekman_quote2.jpg\" alt=\"Beekman Quote Two\" title=\"Beekman Quote Two\"><strong>Baptists and \r\nother denominations</strong></p>\r\n<p>&#160;The Baptists were another large group of \r\nsettlers from New England, many from the Swansea, Massachusetts, area, and they \r\nestablished a church in Pawling by 1758. The records of several local Baptist \r\nchurches have survived. While these records do not include infant baptisms, they \r\nmay contain much personal detail about local residents. Any parishioner who made \r\nthe slightest transgression was brought up on charges at the monthly meetings \r\nand many neighbors would present evidence for and against the accused. Dismissal \r\nfrom the church was a common punishment.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the earliest settlers were Palatines, almost all Lutheran in the \r\nearly years. A Lutheran church was established in the Beekman Patent by 1750, \r\nafter Henry Beekman sold two acres and eight perches of land to six members of \r\nthe Lutheran congregation for the nominal sum of ten shillings. Prior to the \r\nestablishment of this church, local Lutherans had been ministered to by clergy \r\nfrom New York City. No records exist specifically for the church in Beekman, but \r\nLutheran ministers from New York City and Athens in Greene County recorded \r\nbaptisms and marriages that they performed at the local church.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/New_York/beekman_historic_study.gif\" alt=\"Beekman Historic Study\" title=\"Beekman Historic Study\"> <br>The Dutch were \r\nthe earliest settlers of Dutchess County, and Reformed Dutch churches were \r\nestablished in Poughkeepsie and Fishkill by 1716 and 1731, respectively. Many \r\nLutherans had children baptized in the Reformed Church, probably because of the \r\ninfrequent visits by Lutheran ministers. There were no early Reformed churches \r\nin the Beekman Patent, save for a brief existence in the Dover area about \r\n1775.There were Presbyterian churches in Poughkeepsie and Rombout (Fishkill) as \r\nearly as 1749 and in the Nine Partners beginning about 1743 (all not far from \r\nthe western edge of the Beekman Patent line), and many tenants attended. Another \r\nPresbyterian church in Amenia in the Nine Partners Patent served the Dover \r\ncommunity. There were Episcopal churches prior to the Revolution, but they were \r\nnot reestablished until some years after the war ended.A 1772 attempt in the \r\nDover area and another in the present town of Beekman in June 1793 both failed. \r\nUnfortunately very few of these churches have complete records; Presbyterian \r\nsuch for Rombout and Poughkeepsie, for example, include no baptisms or marriages \r\nfrom 1774 to 1822.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Gore, rent wars, and loyalism in Beekman</strong><br>The southern \r\nbounds of the Beekman Patent were challenged by the heirs of Adolph Philipse and \r\nas a result the Beekmans ceded a large part of the southeast corner of the \r\nPatent to his heirs on January 15, 1754.This area was known as the &#8220;Gore,&#8221; and \r\nactions taken by the new owners, Beverley Robinson, Philip Philipse, and Roger \r\nMorris, resulted in the famous &#8220;Rent Wars&#8221; in early Dutchess County. Roger \r\nMorris served as a captain and quartermaster in the French and Indian Wars and \r\nmet several Scots who served with him. After the conflict ended Robinson sold \r\nthese newly-retired officers some of the best farms he had recently acquired in \r\nthe Gore area south of the village of Pawling. Unfortunately, he disregarded the \r\ninterests of the Beekman tenants who had been settled on the farms for twenty \r\nyears or more. Beekman had been fairly lenient in his lease terms and allowed \r\ntenants to post bonds when they were unable to pay rents, extended leases when \r\nthere was hardship, and even forgave rents when there was a bad crop year or a \r\nfamily tragedy. Robinson was not as generous and ordered the tenants off the \r\nfarms. The Sheriff would remove the tenants one day and a gang of neighbors \r\nwould re-install them the next day. This pattern continued for some time until \r\nthe militia was requested and one soldier, George Henry, was shot and died on \r\nAugust 1, 1766.</p>\r\n<p>The problems associated with the retired British officers who bought \r\nRobinson&#8217;s land did not end in 1766. These officers were retired on half-pay and \r\nwere subject to call up when needed. In 1776 the British Crown ordered them to \r\nraise companies to defend the colony. As a result Captains Archibald Campbell \r\nand Duncan Campbell (brothers), and Captains James Grant and Alexander Grant \r\nactively recruited residents in the Pawling/Dover area to join them in their new \r\nLoyalist companies.They were quite successful in convincing the young locals to \r\njoin their companies and go to New York, but two of the captains were killed in \r\nbattles during the war, Archibald Campbell on March 16, 1777, at a battle at \r\nWard&#8217;s house in White Plains, Westchester County, and Alexander Grant on October \r\n6, 1777, at the storming of Forts Clinton and Montgomery near West Point on the \r\nHudson River.[7]</p>\r\n<p>Other resources for Beekman residents Despite the lack of vital records and \r\n(often poor) church records in New York, other data, expecially military \r\nrecords, often fill many gaps. During the French and Indian Wars, 1755&#8211;1764, the \r\nColony of New York constantly raised companies of troops and many muster records \r\nfor Dutchess County have survived. These last provide the soldier&#8217;s name, place \r\nof birth and age, occupation, height, color of hair and eyes, and complexion. \r\nThey also state his date of enlistment, the captain who enlisted him, and in \r\nwhose company he had served.[8] During the Revolution, captains also kept \r\nsimilar musters, but almost all of the original records were destroyed in a fire \r\nat the Albany capitol in 1911. By sheer happenstance we discovered that the \r\nrolls of nine companies of Dutchess County Minutemen had been copied in 1896 and \r\nwere available from the National Archives. The information in these musters was \r\nvery helpful in placing local soldiers.[9] Revolutionary War pension \r\napplications are another excellent source of genealogical data.</p>\r\n<p>The activities of the Loyalist captains also contributed significantly to our \r\nknowledge.The minutes of the local Commission for Detecting and Defeating \r\nConspiracies in the State of New York were published by The New- York Historical \r\nSociety in 1924 and 1925, and there are hundreds of references to Beekman \r\nresidents who participated as Patriots and/or Loyalists (many switched \r\nsides).The lists of signers and non-signers of the Articles of Association in \r\n1775 have survived for Beekman but not Pawling.These lists give an early \r\nindication of men&#8217;s loyalties at the time. A significant number of Beekman and \r\nPawling men were Loyalists and information on their families has been found in \r\nCanada.</p>\r\n<p>After the British occupied New York City in 1776, two of the newspapers \r\npublished in the city moved to Dutchess County. Samuel Louden published <em>New \r\nYork Packet and American Advertiser </em>at Fishkill from 1777 through 1783, and \r\nJohn Holt published <em>New York Journal and General Advertiser </em>at \r\nPoughkeepsie from 1777 to 1782. Both papers carried many articles and notices \r\nabout people in Beekman and other parts of the county.</p>\r\n<p>for the eighteenth century and also provide information on the people in each \r\nprecinct, Beekman and Pawling included.Many individuals are named and \r\nrelationships are often specified.</p>\r\n<p>There were a number of stores in early Dutchess, and some of the most \r\ncomplete records are for those in Beekman.The writer has located ledger books \r\nfor over sixty stores from 1740 through 1820, and has filmed these records and \r\nprepared annotated indexes. Many of these records note family \r\nrelationships;&#8220;Israel Howland&#8217;s son John, his son Daniel, his dau. Sarah,&#8221; are \r\nin the Merritt store book for 1767&#8211;1771. There are few early school records but \r\none for 1796 lists the names of all scholars, the names of their parents, and \r\nthe number of days they attended.</p>\r\n<p>Tax lists exist for the Beekman Patent area from 1717 through 1779, with the \r\nexception of lost records for the years 1749 through 1752, 1764, and 1776, which \r\nwere not recorded. Most tenants in Beekman were assessed at &#163;1. Some, like the \r\nEmighs and John Kane, a prosperous merchant in Pawling at whose home Washington \r\nestablished headquarters (and who later joined the Loyalists), were assessed as \r\nhigh as &#163;18 to &#163;20. The county is blessed with over fifteen thousand &#8220;Ancient \r\nDocuments,&#8221; mostly early court records, and ten thousand or so have been \r\nindexed. Most early road dedications have been recorded and they usually list \r\nthe names of residents who lived along the roads. These, in addition to a number \r\nof eighteenth-century maps, show who lived next to whom &#8212; and men did marry the \r\ngirl next door.</p>\r\n<p>In summary, when all the various resources are combined, a good quantity of \r\ninformation can be found on the settlers of the Beekman Patent and surrounding \r\narea. The vast majority of these people came from New England and usually can be \r\nplaced in their respective families there.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Notes</strong><br><sup>1</sup> Donald Lines Jacobus was quoted as \r\ncalling Dutchess County the &#8220;graveyard of genealogy&#8221; (<em>Genealogical Research: \r\nMethods and Sources</em>, 2 vols.

This became known as the &#8220;Brown Tract.&#8221;&#160; The majority \r\nof this tract (167,000 acres) is located in present-day Herkimer County.&#160; The \r\nrest is in Lewis County (40,000 acres) and Hamilton County (3000 acres).&#160; At a \r\ntime when settlers poured into the state, fueling an enormous population boom, \r\nthree generations of the Brown family failed utterly in their attempts to \r\ndevelop their &#8220;wild lands.&#8221;&#160; In this article we look at the history of John \r\nBrown&#8217;s tract to discover why your New York ancestors probably chose some other \r\nregion of the state in which to settle. </p>\r\n<p><strong>The Brown Family</strong><br><br>John Brown[1] was born in 1736, the son of \r\nJames and Hope (Power) Brown, and the great-grandson of Chad Brown, one of the \r\nearliest settlers in Providence.&#160; John Brown married Sarah Smith and the couple \r\nhad four children.&#160; Son James Brown never married.&#160; Eldest daughter Abigail \r\n(Abby) married John Francis (1763-1796), the son of Tench and Anne (Willing) \r\nFrancis, on January 1, 1788.&#160; They had a son, John Brown Francis.&#160; Middle \r\ndaughter Sarah (Sally) married Charles Frederick Herreshoff (1763-1819), son of \r\nCharles and Agnes (Muehler) Herreshoff, on July 1, 1801.&#160; They had a son, John \r\nBrown Herreshoff.&#160; Youngest daughter Alice married John Brown Mason (ca. 1774 \r\n-1845) on July 16, 1800.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Acquisition of the Brown Tract</strong><br><br>At the close of the \r\nRevolutionary War, the state took over all Crown lands as well as lands held by \r\nloyalists.&#160; In 1792 Alexander Macomb bought an astonishing four million acres \r\nfrom the state at eight cents an acre.&#160; Cash flow was a problem for early land \r\nspeculators and Macomb was bankrupt within six months.&#160; He sold 1.9 million \r\nacres to William Constable for 50,000 pounds.&#160; Six months later Constable sold \r\n1.3 million acres to Samuel Ward for 100,000 pounds and became one of the very \r\nfew land speculators in the region to make a profit. Ward sold the 210,000 acres \r\nthat later became the Brown Tract to James Greenleaf for $24,000. Greenleaf was \r\na business partner with Robert Morris, financier of the Revolution.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; \r\n<br><br>Part of the cash flow problem experienced by businessmen of the time was \r\ndue to the fact that there was simply was not enough money in circulation.&#160; \r\nThus, businessmen used letters of credit as a substitute. To raise money, James \r\nGreenleaf mortgaged his 210,000 acres to John Livingston for $38,000.&#160; In 1794 \r\nJohn Francis, a son-in-law and business partner of James Brown, accepted a \r\nsecond mortgage on the land as payment for a shipload of tea.&#160; Considering the \r\nprestige of the Greenleaf-Morris partnership at the time, it was a reasonable \r\nbusiness transaction.[2] &#160; However, the panic of 1796 put both Greenleaf and \r\nMorris in debtors&#8217; prison.&#160; When it finally became clear that James Greenleaf&#8217;s \r\nfinancial state was not going to recover sufficiently to honor his note, John \r\nBrown sent his son James to visit the area in August 1798.&#160; James did not go to \r\nthe Brown Tract itself, but instead traveled to Utica and Rome (the two largest \r\nsettlements in the area), and to Boonville. He wrote that &#8220;these regions \r\nalthough settled only about 10 or 12 years are thickly inhabited and many of the \r\ninhabitants are again emigrating.&#8221;[3] &#160; John Brown did not have first-hand \r\ninformation about the land in question.&#160; At this point he made the business \r\ndecision not to accept the loss, but to buy the land by paying off John \r\nLivingston&#8217;s first mortgage.&#160; According to Brown and Walton, &#8220;If Brown had not \r\nbid on it, the land&#8217;s selling price, if anybody wanted to buy it, would have \r\nbeen much lower, not even enough to cover the Livingston Mortgage.&#8221;[4] &#160; John \r\nBrown got the deed to the tract on December 5, 1798.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>First Generation Development Attempts (1798&#8211;1803)</strong><br><br>John Brown \r\nhad his tract surveyed into eight townships, which he named Industry, \r\nEnterprise, Perseverance, Unanimity, Frugality, Sobriety, Economy, and \r\nRegularity.&#160; We find the following instructions to his surveyor, John Hammon, in \r\na letter dated March 31, 1799.&#160; </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You&#8217;l be very particular in Your Field book &amp; Note Every thing of \r\nImportance, so as to Give Me the Value of Every Town as near as posable by its \r\nNumber.&#160; You&#8217;l be sure to Note Every Mill place, Every Good place for a Compact \r\nTown, the ore, the Salt Springs if aney, the kind of Timber, the Lay of the \r\nGround Weither good or bad or Indifferent, Weither Broken, or Even or Weither \r\nLarge or Small Hills and Every other Observation You think worthey of My \r\nKnowing.&#8221;[5] &#160; </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Brown laid plans for a village at the confluence of north and middle branches \r\nof the Moose River, with a grist&#160; mill andsaw mill, and he hoped to build about \r\n500 miles of roads.&#160; John Brown&#8217;s expectation was that settlers would come, \r\nplant crops, have good harvests, and thus attract more settlers.&#160; It was, after \r\nall, what was happening in the Black River Valley a few miles west.&#160; He hired \r\nJames Sheldon as his agent to oversee the clearing of the land.&#160; Early surveyor \r\nreports of the tract having rocky ground instead of rich farmland did not \r\ndissuade John Brown.&#160; In a letter to Sheldon, he blithely praised the virtues of \r\nstone walls:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There is nothing in My Mind that can Impeade the Rappid Settlement of my \r\nLands unless there is too Maney Stones which from the account of those who had \r\nReconorterd to Westward I confess give accts of more stones than I wish to have \r\nhad, tho a large proportion of Stones Would in time be an Advantage Rather than \r\nDisadvantage to the Land, as no Fence in the World is Equilly Valuable to a Good \r\nStone wall.&#8221;[6] </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The work of building roads, bridges, and mills went slowly.&#160; Sheldon was not \r\nable to clear land for crops, so all supplies had to be hauled in.&#160; Few settlers \r\ncame and fewer stayed.&#160; In January of 1800 John Brown wrote to Sheldon, &#8220;I must \r\nclose by beging you to make use of all the Oconnemy in Your power and Reduce the \r\nExpenses already Exceeded my Expectation.&#160; More than Double Considering there is \r\nno produce Yet Raised &amp; but Little Land prepared.&#8221;[7] &#160;&#160; John Brown&#8217;s \r\nefforts to turn a profit on this venture ended with his death on September 20, \r\n1803.&#160; The townships of Industry, Enterprise, and Perseverance, went to his \r\nwife, Sarah; Unanimity went to his daughter, Abby Francis; he left Frugality to \r\nhis daughter, Sarah Herreshoff;Sobriety was given to his daughter, Alice \r\nMason;Economy to his grandson, John Brown Francis; and Regularity to his son \r\nJames Brown.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>John Brown had built a dam, a sawmill, a gristmill, a store, a few houses, \r\nand a road from Boonville crossing the Moose River into Old Forge. His will \r\ndescribes the improvements made in the townships of Industry (&#8220;2 Log Houses, a \r\ngood Barn &amp; considerable improvements of cleared land.&#8221;)&#160; and Economy (&#8220;a \r\nGrist Mill &amp; Saw Mill, House, Store etc. on this Town is the best of Pine \r\nTimber which may be floated to the Mill &amp; saw&#8217;d in to the best Pine Boards, \r\nvery cheap.&#8221;).&#160; For all his effort and expense there were probably fewer than a \r\ndozen people living on the tract when he died.[8] </p>\r\n<p><strong>Second Generation Development Attempts (1806&#8211;1819)</strong><br><br>The first of \r\nthe second generation to try to settle the &#8220;wild lands&#8221; of the Brown Tract was \r\nJames Mason, husband of John Brown&#8217;s youngest daughter, Alice.&#160; In April of 1806 \r\nJames B. Mason hired Joseph Shaw to go to what is now Old Forge and attempt to \r\nattract settlers. James and Alice Mason made the first sale at the end of 1807, \r\nwhen Oliver Ingalls of Windham, Connecticut, purchased one thousand acres for \r\n$2000.&#160; In May of 1808 they sold parcels to three settlers, a total of 940 acres \r\nfor $1850.</p>\r\n<p>In 1811, Charles Frederick Herreshoff, husband of John Brown&#8217;s middle \r\ndaughter Sarah, arrived in the Brown Tract with his nephew, John Brown Francis.&#160; \r\nThey found all of John Brown&#8217;s earlier work on the roads, bridges, and mills of \r\nthe tract in disrepair.&#160; Herreshoff began again, but all of his ventures seemed \r\ndoomed to failure.&#160; In 1815 he decided to try sheep ranching.&#160; The sheep died.&#160; \r\nThe next year he wanted to establish a nail factory on the tract.&#160; The necessary \r\nloan was refused.&#160; This was also the &#8220;Year Without a Summer,&#8221; because of an \r\neruption of the Tambora volcano in the Indian Ocean the previous year. This \r\nresulted in heavy snowfall in the second week of June, ruining most crops.&#160; In \r\n1817 he built a forge (thus giving a name to present-day Old Forge). He wrote to \r\nhis daughter Anna: &#8220;There is no more doubt but what we have two sources of the \r\nmost valuable ore, and both inexhaustible.&#8221;[9] &#160; Even though Herreshoff stayed \r\non site through the winter of 1817-18 to work on the mine, the ore quality was \r\nactually rather poor.&#160; He died on site on December 19, 1819, apparently by his \r\nown hand.&#160; John Mason had died the same year.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Third Generation Development Attempts (1819&#8211;1850)</strong><br><br>In 1819, \r\nSarah, widow of John Brown, turned over the three townships she owned to her \r\ndaughter Abby Francis, her grandson, John Brown Francis, and her daughter Sarah \r\nHerreshoff.&#160; Abby Francis died intestate on March 5, 1821, at age fifty-four.&#160; \r\nSarah Herreshoff died on August 2, 1846, nearly seventy-three.&#160; What remained of \r\nthe Brown Tract was then in the hands of John Brown&#8217;s two grandsons and \r\nnamesakes &#8211; John Brown Francis and John Brown Herreshoff. <br><br>There followed \r\nyears of tentative offers, none of which reached fruition.&#160; Land reverted to the \r\nstate for payment of back taxes and was sometimes later redeemed within the \r\nallowable two-year period.&#160; The township of Sobriety, inherited by Alice Mason, \r\nwas not redeemed.&#160;&#160; Even though the taxes were quite low (approximately $700 per \r\nyear), the estate was producing no income.&#160; It was a steady drain on the family \r\nfinances.<br><br>Finally on March 20, 1850, John Brown Francis sold his interest \r\nin the Brown Tract &#8211; approximately 93,000 acres spread over six townships&#160; &#8211; to \r\nLyman Rasselas Lyon.&#160; A few weeks later, on April 4, 1850, John Brown Herreshoff \r\nsold his remaining interest &#8211; approximately 69,000 acres in three townships &#8211; to \r\nthe same Lyman Lyon.&#160; <br><br>Lyman Lyon, who would now try to make a going \r\ncommercial concern out of this land, was the son of Caleb Lyon, an early settler \r\nin the region.&#160; A biography in Hough&#8217;s <em>History of Lewis County</em> begins: \r\n&#8220;Lyman Rasselas Lyon, than whom no citizen of Lewis County, past or present, is \r\nmore entitled to the touch of the biographer&#8217;s pen, was born in what is now \r\nWalworth, Wayne County, N. Y., in 1806, and came a lad of twelve years with his \r\nfather to Lewis County.&#8221;[10] &#160; The biography goes on to describe Lyman Lyon&#8217;s \r\npolitical and business activities including the Moose River and Otter Lake \r\ntanneries.&#160; Father and son were also involved in railroads.&#160; The Sackett&#8217;s \r\nHarbor &amp; Saratoga Railroad Company was incorporated on April 10, 1848, but \r\nnot actually organized until January 10, 1852.&#160; Caleb Lyon performed the \r\ngroundbreaking ceremony on April 8, 1852, near Dayanville.&#160; Lyman Lyon was one \r\nof the directors, having contracted the Brown Tract to the company.&#160; By the fall \r\nof 1854, construction had ceased. &#160;The name was changed to Lake Ontario &amp; \r\nHudson River Railroad Company on April 6, 1857, and fresh capital was sought in \r\nEngland. In 1860 the name was changed to the Adirondack Estate and Railroad \r\nCompany. The project was stopped by the Civil War.&#160; The company went bankrupt \r\nand came through receivership to Thomas C. Durant, who was connected with the \r\nUnion Pacific Railroad. [11] &#160; Lyman Lyon died on April 7, 1869, the largest \r\nsingle landowner in Lewis County.[12] </p>\r\n<p><strong>John Brown Tract Today</strong><br><br>With the completion of the Erie Canal, \r\nsettlers poured into upstate New York.&#160; By 1842 the population in the region \r\nfrom Utica to Buffalo had increased to over a million people.&#160; At this same time \r\nthe 328-square-mile Brown Tract was home to about fifty to sixty people &#8211; about \r\nsix square miles per person.&#160; Even today only one substantial road crosses the \r\nsouthern edge&#160; (Rt. 28).&#160; The failure of the Brown family to develop the area \r\ndiscouraged others from trying.&#160; Today the entire tract is within the &#8220;forever \r\nwild&#8221; Adirondack Forest Preserve, created by the New York State Legislature in \r\n1885.[13] &#160; </p>\r\n<p>So what went wrong?&#160; One might try to second-guess some of the business \r\ndecisions, such as the iron mine and forge, but ultimately one must come back to \r\nthe land itself.&#160; To a geologist it is clear that there are sharp changes over \r\nthe course of just a few miles.&#160; The land in the Brown Tract was not (and is \r\nnot) suitable for farming.&#160; It is rocky.&#160; The growing season is short, less than \r\n100 days.&#160; The winters are harsh.&#160; Settlers simply could not raise enough food \r\nduring the summer to support themselves.&#160; And there was good land farther to the \r\nwest, which was available on equal or better terms.&#160; Thus, even though it was \r\nclose to Albany, one of the oldest settled areas in the state, the Brown Tract \r\nremained a wilderness long after the &#8220;west was won.&#8221;&#160; Genealogically speaking, \r\nit is a desert.<br clear=\"all\"></p>\r\n<div><hr size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" align=\"left\">\r\n<div id=\"ftn1\"><p>[1] This John Brown should not be confused with the famous abolitionist of \r\nthe same name.</p>\r\n</div><div id=\"ftn2\"><p>[2] Newest information on this point contradicts the established version \r\nfound in such sources as <em>A History of the Adirondacks</em>, Alfred L. \r\nDonaldson, Harrison, N.

In this article we concentrate on the \r\nsettlement of one small part of this tract, the town of Prattsburg. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>Briefly, Oliver Phelps of Windsor, Connecticut and Nathaniel Gorham of \r\nCharlestown, Massachusetts obtained title to land east of the Genesee River on \r\nNovember 21, 1788. Because of financial difficulties they transferred the lands \r\nthey had not disposed of to Robert Morris on November 18, 1790. In less than a \r\nyear after Morris took possession of the tract, his London agents sold it, at \r\nmore than double the price, to three Englishmen, Sir William Pulteney, William \r\nHornby, and Patrick Colquhoun. </p>\r\n<p>The Phelps-Gorham tract had been divided into ranges, each a strip six miles \r\nwide running from north to south. Range 1 ran along the eastern border, the \r\nso-called preemption line. Range 7 ran along the western border, the Genesee \r\nRiver. The ranges were divided into townships, each a strip six miles wide \r\nrunning from east to west. Township 1 lay on the Pennsylvania border, while \r\ntownship 14 bordered Lake Ontario. The standard parcel was thus 36 square miles. \r\nOn June 16, 1802, Capt. Joel Pratt, of Spencertown, Columbia County, N.Y. and \r\nWilliam Root of Albany County, N.Y. contracted with the Pulteney group for \r\ntownship 6, range 3, on the northern border of Steuben County. \r\n<sup>1</sup>Advertisements at the time assured the public that \"the soil was \r\nfertile; the forests abounded with game, the lakes with fish; the climate was \r\ndelightful and healthy.\" Other promotional materials highlighted the \r\npossibilities for \"easy communications with different markets\" and encouraged \r\n\"those who wish their estates in a few years to increase in extent and value\" to \r\nconsider settling on the Steuben Frontier. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n<p>Captain Joel Pratt, of Colchester, Connecticut, journeyed to the present site \r\nof Prattsburg as early as 1799 and built a log cabin. He returned in February \r\n1800 with his son Harvey, four ox-teams, and six men (including subsequent \r\nsettler Uriah Chapin). That season they claimed to have cleared 110 acres of \r\nheavy forest and sowed it to wheat in the fall. They then returned to Columbia \r\nCounty. Jared Pratt, nephew of Capt. Joel Pratt, and his wife arrived with the \r\nothers next season. They built a barn to store the harvest, and threshed the \r\nwheat throughout the winter. They then sent it the short distance to Bath on ox \r\ncarts and ground some of it to flour. In the spring of 1802, the wheat was \r\nfloated to Baltimore on arks and sold for $8000. <sup>3</sup></p>\r\n<p>This easy communication with \"civilization\" accelerated the process of \r\ntransforming frontier land into an established community. In contrast to the \r\nfirst settlers on the east coast of North America, whose supply line stretched \r\nacross the Atlantic Ocean, settlers in the \"Steuben Frontier\" faced a half-day \r\njourney to Bath and, as Joel Pratt's wheat crop demonstrated, a river journey of \r\na few days to reach large commercial centers like Harrisburg, Columbia, \r\nBaltimore, and other Atlantic coast ports. Irvin W. Near writes in his \r\n<em>History of Steuben County</em> (Chicago, 1911), \"During the high water season \r\nin the early years of the settlement of this valley this river was navigable for \r\narks from Liberty in the town of Cohocton, this county [Steuben], where they \r\nwere built, and in which the products of the vicinity were shipped to markets in \r\nPennsylvania and Maryland. At Bath and other places on this river storehouses \r\nwere built and yards established for the accumulation and keeping of property \r\nawaiting shipment by these river crafts.\" <sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<p>Prattsburg's most famous citizen is Narcissa Prentiss, who migrated west to \r\nOregon with her husband Marcus to establish a mission for Native Americans in \r\n1836. Prentiss was born in Prattsburg in 1808, the daughter of Stephen Prentiss, \r\none of the earliest settlers. During her lifetime Prattsburg was transformed \r\nfrom a forest to a thriving community of several thousand people. Stephen \r\nPrentiss was born in Grafton, Mass. in 1777. <sup>5</sup>He married Clarissa \r\nWard January 3, 1803 in Onondaga County, N.Y. <br><br>Children of Stephen and \r\nClarissa Prentiss: </p>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><table border=\"1\" width=\"70%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"204\" class=\"contentTableText\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Stephen Turner Prentiss </p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"204\" class=\"contentTableText\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">b.1804</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"204\" class=\"contentTableText\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">organ builder, mar.

Pratt, a devout Congregationalist, \r\nwas a significant force in the religious life of the new community. New settlers \r\nwere required to pay to the trustees of the Religious Society an annual fee of \r\n$15 for each 100 acres. Pratt induced the Reverend John Niles to come by \r\noffering him 80 acres of land. Rev. Niles arrived in the autumn of 1803 and held \r\nthe settlement's first religious services at the home of Jared Pratt. William P. \r\nCurtis, Samuel Tuthill, Pomeroy Hull, and Salisbury Burton arrived in 1804. \r\nSettlers present by 1806 were Enoch Niles, Rufus Blodgett , Jesse Waldo, Judge \r\nHopkins, John Hopkins, Dea. Ebenezer Rice, Robert Potter, Dea. Gamaliel Loomis, \r\nSamuel Hays, Dea. Abiel Lindsley, Moses Lyon, Uriel Chapin, Asher Bull, Rohan \r\nHills, and Stephen Prentiss. <br><br>In 1806, Ira Pratt and Joel Pratt Jr. \r\nopened a general store in the village of Prattsburg. The first post office \r\nopened in 1807 with Joel Pratt Jr. as postmaster. Post riders traveling weekly \r\nbetween Geneva and Bath now stopped in Prattsburg.

Framed houses, orchards, and gardens flourished where forests once were, \r\nand many types of mills were in full operation. The 1825 state census indicated \r\nthat only 18 percent of Prattsburg families owned unimproved land. Stephen \r\nPrentiss owned more improved land than eighty percent of the town's citizens, \r\nwith 67 acres of such land and 2 mills to his name. </p>\r\n<p>In 1822, plans were put forward to build the Franklin Academy for Advanced \r\nStudies, (\"advanced studies\" meaning beyond elementary school). Named for \r\nBenjamin Franklin, the Academy was funded by local subscription. The $2000 \r\npledged for construction and $4000 for maintenance, all from town residents, was \r\na sure indicator that Prattsburg could no longer be considered a frontier \r\noutpost. The first Academy building, a two-story structure adorned by an \r\nornamental cupola, was erected on land purchased from Judge Porter. The first \r\nstudents were admitted in 1824 and the school became so successful that in 1827, \r\na \"female department\" was added. Narcissa Prentiss, then aged 19, was one of the \r\nfirst female students to attend. </p>\r\n<p><strong>III. Epilogue</strong><br><br>In June of 1834, Stephen Prentiss moved his \r\nfamily about 40 miles southwest of Prattsburg to a new community in neighboring \r\nAllegany County called Amity (since changed to Belmont). Presumably this new \r\ncommunity had ready work for a carpenter and joiner. Shortly afterward they \r\nmoved again to nearby Angelica where his son Jason operated a dry goods store. \r\nNarcissa Prentiss married Dr. Marcus Whitman on February 18, 1836. They both \r\nfulfilled long held dreams to become missionaries and were sent to Oregon. \r\nMarcus eventually went back to the East Coast but soon returned, leading the \r\nfirst large migration to the West via the Oregon Trail. Unfortunately, the mass \r\nmigration triggered a deadly measles outbreak that decimated the population of \r\nthe Cayuse tribe that the Prentisses labored for. Surviving members of the \r\ntribe, enraged by the loss of nearly all of their children, took revenge and \r\nkilled the Prentisses along with 12 other pioneers on November 29, 1847. \r\n<sup>6</sup><br><br>The Prentiss family is illustrative of the history of many \r\nof the early settlers of Prattsburg and Steuben County. They came from New \r\nEngland bringing with them their Congregationalist faith, their belief in the \r\nvalue of education, and their strong sense of community. They built a new home \r\non the frontier, and then, in a generation or two, moved on. Some families, \r\nhowever, stayed and put down roots. Their history is imprinted on the very names \r\nof the streets in the village of Prattsburg. Pratt Street crosses Main Street, \r\nappropriately enough, by the acre of land that Joel Pratt donated in 1806 as a \r\ncemetery. Waldo Road recalls wagon maker Jesse Waldo, <sup>7</sup>and Porter \r\nStreet commemorates Judge Robert Porter. <sup>8</sup><br><br>On February 28, \r\n1923, the Franklin Academy was destroyed by fire. It was rebuild as Prattsburgh \r\nCentral School. The house in which Narcissa Prentiss was born is now preserved \r\nas a museum and leases space to the Prattsburg Community Historical Society, \r\nwhich shows the house to visitors during the summer. </p>\r\n<sup>1.</sup> Joel Pratt \r\nwould later buy out William Root's share.<br><sup>2.</sup> <em>Converting the \r\nWest</em>, Julie Roy Jeffrey, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, OK, 1991, \r\nChap. 1, pp 3-4.<br><sup>3.</sup> With the given price of $2.50/bushel, one may \r\ncalculate that the110 acres yielded 3200 bushels or 29 \r\nbushels/acre.<br><sup>4.</sup> <em>History of Steuben County</em>, Irvin W.

Introduction</strong></p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>The Erie Canal, begun in 1817 and completed in 1825, was then the longest \r\ncanal in the world.&#160; It connected Albany, on the Hudson River, with Buffalo on \r\nLake Erie, and thus opened up the state to travel, immigration, and commerce.&#160; \r\nSome cities, like Rochester and Lockport, were created because of the canal, \r\ngiving rise to its most flattering alias &#8220;Mother of Cities.&#8221;&#160; Other established \r\ncommunities, like Geneva and Canandaigua, were eclipsed because the canal \r\nbypassed them.&#160; Canal construction required a great deal of manpower.&#160; Initial \r\nreliance on part-time labor by local farm workers proved to be inefficient.&#160; The \r\nshift to construction crews offered job opportunities that were snatched up by \r\nunskilled European immigrants, most notably the Irish.&#160; As each section of the \r\ncanal was put into operation, travel and trade expanded, attracting more \r\nsettlers into the region.&#160; Your ancestors may have been among these new \r\narrivals.&#160; Or, if your ancestors were already living in New York State, they may \r\nhave moved in response to the &#8220;Big Ditch.&#8221;&#160; In this article we examine the \r\neffect of the canal on communities on and off its route.</p>\r\n<p><strong>II. Building the Canal</strong></p>\r\n<p>The original Erie Canal was forty feet wide at the top, twenty-eight feet \r\nwide at the bottom, and four feet deep.&#160; The original locks were fifteen feet \r\nwide and ninety feet long.&#160; This was just big enough to accommodate two-way \r\ntraffic using the canal boats of the time.&#160; The canal was dug by hand using \r\nshovels, men, wheelbarrows, and mules.&#160; No power tools.&#160; If your ancestor helped \r\ndig the canal, it is a good assumption that he was young, strong, a hard worker, \r\nand probably unmarried.&#160; <br><br>A berm was constructed on one side of the canal \r\nand a ten-foot-wide towpath on the other side.&#160; Numerous bridges were \r\nconstructed over the canal to enable local farmers to reach their fields.&#160; They \r\nwere less than eight feet above the water level causing boat passengers to \r\nhunker down to avoid an unwanted dip.<br><br>Construction began on July 4, 1817, \r\nin Rome.&#160; This site was chosen in part because the canal route west of Rome \r\ncontained long flat stretches and required relatively few locks.&#160; The original \r\nroute went through a swamp to the south of Rome, rather than through the town \r\ncenter, which greatly displeased the citizenry.[1] The eastern route near Albany \r\nwas more rocky and harder to dig.&#160; The western route near Lockport included a \r\nseventy-foot drop in elevation, requiring a complex series of locks.&#160; Each \r\nsection was put into operation as soon as it was completed, the tolls being used \r\nto help fund the project.&#160; The table below shows when each section was \r\ncompleted.</p>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\" class=\"contentTableText\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>Year</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p><strong>Canal Section Opened for Use</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>1819</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Utica to Rome</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>1820</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Syracuse to Utica</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>1821</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Rome to Little Falls</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>1822</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Little Falls to Schenectady and Rochester to Syracuse</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>1823</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Schenectady to Albany and Brockport to Rochester</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>1824</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Lockport to Brockport</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>1825</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td valign=\"top\"><p>Buffalo to Lockport</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div><p><br>Rome&#8217;s rival, Utica, was a tiny settlement before it became a major port \r\non the Erie Canal.&#160; The population of this upstart quickly outstripped that of \r\nRome.&#160; From 1820 to 1830 the population of Utica rose from 2,947 to 12,782, an \r\nincrease of 334%.&#160; In comparison, the population of Rome in the same time period \r\nrose from 3,569 to 4,360, an increase of 22%.<br><br>If your ancestors lived in \r\nSchenectady at this time, they may have found the canal to be a mixed blessing.&#160; \r\nSchenectady had been the eastern terminus of the navigable portion of the Mohawk \r\nRiver. The new canal threatened the prosperous warehousing and boat building \r\nbusinesses as well as the inns and taverns that had developed around this \r\ntransfer point.&#160; In fact, from 1820 to 1830 the population of Schenectady \r\nactually decreased slightly from 12,876 to 12,347 or -4%.</p>\r\n<p>Other western boomtowns such as Syracuse, Buffalo, Rochester, and Lockport \r\nwere essentially created by the arrival of the canal.&#160; The population growth in \r\nthese towns was accomplished in part by settlers new to the state, and in part \r\nby a shift from established communities not on the new canal route.&#160; Take, for \r\nexample, the case of Lyman Spalding.&#160; In 1820 Lyman Spalding opened a grocery \r\nstore in Canandaigua, the county seat of Ontario County.&#160; Located on the \r\nnorthern tip of Canandaigua Lake, Canandaigua had been chosen by <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Phelps and  Gorham\" href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/the-phelps-gorham-purchase/\">Phelps and  Gorham</a> as the site of their land office.&#160; It had been connected to eastern \r\nmarkets by a toll road in 1804 and enjoyed a deserved reputation as a promising \r\nsite for business.&#160; The grocery store prospered.&#160; Canandaigua was the most \r\nimportant community in the region before the construction of the canal.&#160; \r\nHowever, the route of the Erie Canal passed thirteen miles to the north and \r\nstate officials denied the town&#8217;s request to build a feeder canal.&#160; Business \r\ndeclined and in 1822 Spalding followed his customers to Rochester.&#160; While the \r\npopulation of Rochester grew from 1,502 in 1820 to 9,207 in 1830, or 513%, the \r\npopulation of Canandaigua grew from 4,680 to 5,162, or only 10%. </p>\r\n<p>The canal route also bypassed the salt-producing community of Salina.&#160; \r\nHowever, a mile-long side cut from the canal south to Onondaga Creek was put in \r\nto connect the salt works with the canal.&#160; The new town of Syracuse, which had a \r\npopulation of 250 in 1820, grew up at the junction of the canal and the side \r\ncut.&#160; It eventually expanded to absorb Salina and its salt works.[2] &#160; </p>\r\n<p>The town of Lockport is justly named.&#160; At this point the water level changes \r\nseventy feet through a series of five pairs of locks, accommodating two-way \r\ntraffic.&#160; The town simply did not exist in 1820.&#160; In the summer of 1821 there \r\nwere three families living in this frontier.&#160; By 1830 the population had \r\nmushroomed to 2,022.</p>\r\n<p>When the canal reached Buffalo in 1825, the time required to transport goods \r\nto and from New York City dropped from six weeks to ten days and the cost of \r\ntransport dropped to one-fifth the former value.&#160; If your ancestor was a \r\nbusinessman in the area, he faced numerous interesting opportunities.&#160; Some \r\nenterprising merchants stocked canal boats and brought groceries, dry goods, and \r\nhousehold goods to what had been empty frontier only a few years before.&#160; Show \r\nboats brought legitimate theater into the local halls of communities that never \r\nbefore had contact with such culture.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>III. Opening Celebrations</strong></p>\r\n<p>The opening of each section of the canal was celebrated with various \r\ndignitaries making speeches in canal boats along the new route.&#160; If your \r\nancestor lived anywhere along the route, it is likely that the whole family \r\nwould have taken part in at least one of these events.&#160; In October 1819 the \r\nfirst fifteen-mile stretch from Rome to Utica was opened.&#160; The canal boat \r\n<em>Chief Engineer of Rome</em> traveled from Rome to Utica and returned the next \r\nday.&#160; On July 4, 1820, in a more elaborate show, seventy-three new canal boats \r\ntraveled from Syracuse to Rome to celebrate the completion of the middle section \r\nof the canal.</p>\r\n<p>The final celebration was particularly impressive.&#160; The stops made along that \r\njourney from Buffalo to Albany followed the full original canal route.&#160; A \r\nflotilla of canal boats assembled in Buffalo, to be joined by others as they \r\nproceeded eastward.&#160; The first boat, <em>The Seneca Chief</em>, carried Governor \r\nDeWitt Clinton and other dignitaries (including the Marquis de Lafayette), a \r\nbarrel of water from Lake Erie (to be poured into the harbor at New York City), \r\nand a second barrel containing water from the Amazon, Columbia, Gambia, Ganges, \r\nIndus, LaPlata, Mississippi, Nile, Orinoco, Rhine, Seine, and Thames rivers.&#160; \r\nThe second boat, <em>Noah&#8217;s Ark</em>, carried &#8220;a rare assortment of birds, fish, \r\nand insects, including a pair of eagles, a pair of fawns, a fox, two young \r\nbears, and two Seneca Indian boys.&#8221;[3] </p>\r\n<p>The entire 425-mile route from Buffalo to New York City was lined with war \r\ncannons, thirty-two pounders, used by Commodore Perry&#8217;s fleet against the \r\nBritish on Lake Erie during the War of 1812.&#160; The cannon were spaced so that \r\neach gunner was within earshot of the next.&#160; George Condon describes what \r\noccurred at ten o&#8217;clock on the morning of Wednesday, October 26, 1825, as the \r\nboats prepared to set off.&#160; &#8220;[The] first gunner lighted the fuse &#8230; fearsome \r\nenough to be heard by the next, unseen, gunner down the line because it seemed \r\nas if the echoing boom from the northeast came so quickly as to step on the \r\nlingering reverberations of the first roar &#8230; it rolled through the country of \r\nthe Mohawks, the Senecas, the Onondagas, the Cayugas, the Oneidas, and the \r\nTuscaroras &#8230; moved east, through the Niagara Country, the Genesee Country, the \r\nMontezuma swampland, through the Mohawk Valley, past the Catskills, and down the \r\nHudson&#8230; It took the cannon telegraph relay only one hour and twenty minutes to \r\nreach the island of Manhattan and deposit its historic word before turning about \r\nfor the return relay to Buffalo.&#8221;[4] &#160; </p>\r\n<p>At the first stop, Lockport, more boats were to join the procession.&#160; The \r\nlocal welcoming delegation, however, convened at the foot of the great array of \r\nfive locks and ascended to the top of the Niagara escarpment, thus officially \r\nopening the locks themselves. They then sailed west to meet the oncoming \r\nflotilla, returned with them, descended through the locks, and took everyone off \r\nto the Washington House for an elegant banquet. The next day, Thursday, they \r\narrived in Rochester, where the grandly named canal boat, <em>The Young Lion of \r\nthe West</em>, joined the fleet.&#160; In Weedsport the celebration was dimmed by \r\ntragedy when the explosion of a cannon killed two gunners.&#160; Saturday afternoon, \r\nOctober 29<sup>th</sup>, they reached Syracuse for a banquet at Williston&#8217;s \r\nMansion House.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>In Rome a group of citizens who resented the decision to position the canal \r\nroute a mere half-mile to the south formed a solemn procession and protested by \r\npouring a barrel of tar into the canal.&#160; Having made their point, they then \r\njoined the celebration at Starr&#8217;s Hotel that evening.&#160; The canal boats stopped \r\nin Utica on Sunday morning for church and reached Little Falls Sunday night.&#160; \r\nThey arrived after dark, the canal being illuminated by burning barrels of tar, \r\nwhich had been placed along the edge of the cliffs above the locks.&#160; In Fort \r\nPlain the next evening, Monday, October 31<sup>st</sup>, their arrival was also \r\nilluminated; this time the burning barrels had been placed on top of high poles \r\non Prospect Hill and appeared to hang in the air.&#160; The reception Tuesday \r\nafternoon in Schenectady was subdued due to an increased awareness among the \r\ntown&#8217;s businessmen of the negative aspects of the canal on their town.&#160; Dinner \r\nwas polite, but restrained.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>In the thirty miles between Schenectady and Albany the land dropped 218 feet, \r\nrequiring twenty-six locks.&#160; The city of Albany provided dinner outdoors for 600 \r\non the Columbia Street Bridge.&#160; On November 4<sup>th</sup>, the tenth day of \r\ntravel, the boats arrived at Sandy Hook in New York Harbor.&#160; The party that \r\nfollowed was stunning.&#160; Ceremonies in the harbor lasted all day, followed by \r\nmore festivities on land the next day including a grand parade with floats, \r\nexhibits (remember the animals?), and finally, a grand ball.&#160; After the events \r\nconcluded in Manhattan, the boats returned to Buffalo and closed the circle by \r\npouring a barrel of water from the Atlantic Ocean into Lake Erie.</p>\r\n<p>The canal was more successful than anyone had predicted &#8211; and the predictions \r\nwere very high.&#160; The total cost of building the canal was $7,700,000.&#160; Income in \r\n1826, the first year after it was completed, exceeded $1,000,000.&#160; This income \r\nwas raised with the operation of 160 freight boats and a few packet (passenger) \r\nboats.&#160; Tolls were reduced in 1833, but traffic grew so fast that profits still \r\nincreased.&#160; By 1836 the remaining debt, $3,500,000, was paid off and there were \r\n3,000 boats on the canal.&#160; If the boats had been spaced evenly, this would be \r\nequivalent to about one boat every seventy feet.&#160; Not surprisingly, in 1835 and \r\nagain in 1862, the canal was widened and the route altered &#8211; all accomplished \r\nwhile the canal was in use.&#160; A system of secondary feeder canals grew up.&#160; But, \r\nby the time of the Civil War, railroads were offering serious competition and \r\nthe &#8220;Big Ditch&#8221; faded from the public consciousness.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>IV.

Willink and Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck &#8211; were added to form the \r\n<em>Hollandische Land Compagnie</em>.&#160; </p>\r\n<strong>The Holland Purchase</strong><p>On November 30, 1789, the company hired Theophilus Cazenove as their General \r\nAgent. He was to manage all of their U.S. investments, one of which was to be a \r\n3.3 million acre tract west of the Genessee River. This transaction became known \r\nas the Holland Purchase.&#160; Unlike Pennsylvania, where the company also made large \r\npurchases, New York State law forbade aliens from owning land.[1] &#160; Thus, for \r\nthe New York purchases Cazenove created a board of trustees to hold the land for \r\nthe company.&#160; In a series of five deeds in 1792 and 1793, Robert Morris sold \r\nthis land to Herman LeRoy, John Linklaen, Gerrit Boon, William Bayard, and \r\nMatthew Clarkson.[2] &#160; Although the sale included an agreement by Robert Morris \r\nto assist in the extinction of Indian rights to the land, this was not \r\naccomplished until the Treaty of Big Tree on September 15, 1797. Several tracts, \r\nranging in size from one to seventy square miles, were not part of this treaty, \r\nand these were the reservations of Cannawagus, Little Beard&#8217;s and Big Tree, \r\nSquakie Hill, Gardeau, Canadea, Oil Spring, Allegany, Cattaragus, Buffalo, \r\nTonawanda, and Tuscarora. <strong>&#160;</strong>The larger reservations may still be located \r\non a current state map.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Survey</strong></p>\r\n<p>Before the land could be sold, this vast territory had to be mapped and \r\nsurveyed. Cazenove had engaged Joseph Ellicott as principal surveyor in 1794. \r\nThis was a logical choice considering that Joseph Ellicott&#8217;s older brother \r\nAndrew, who became Surveyor General of the United States, trained Joseph and \r\nmade him his assistant in surveying the city of Washington.&#160; Joseph Ellicott \r\nserved the Holland Land Company at other locations, principally in western \r\nPennsylvania, until the Treaty of Big Tree was signed.&#160; He then began the task \r\nof surveying the boundaries of the New York land and subdividing it into \r\ntownships and ranges.&#160; He and his crew of about one hundred fifty men began in \r\nMarch 1798 and finished in October 1800, at a total cost to the company of close \r\nto seventy-one thousand dollars.&#160; He employed the transit method to avoid the \r\ntypes of errors that plagued the eastern boundary of the Phelps-Gorham \r\npurchase.&#160; This method required line-of-sight measurements, which in turn \r\nrequired the crews to cut clear swathes along each line.&#160; The survey was slow, \r\nlabor intensive, and accurate.</p>\r\n<p>The company needed the survey in order to describe the land involved in each \r\nsale.&#160; When the state later created towns and counties, the political boundaries \r\noften, but not always, followed the existing township and range boundaries.&#160; \r\nThus the present-day boundary between Cattaraugus and Erie counties divides \r\nranges 5, 6, 7, and 8 of township 6 between the two counties.</p>\r\n<strong>Land Sales \r\nBegin</strong><p>In 1799 Theophilus Cazenove resigned as General Agent of the Holland Land \r\nCompany.&#160; His successor was Paul Busti[3] .&#160; Busti had worked for the company \r\nsince 1796, and continued to do so until he died in office on July 23, 1824.&#160; \r\nHis chief clerk, John J. Vanderkemp, succeeded him.&#160; It was Busti who suggested \r\nthe name of Batavia for the community in which the first local land office was \r\nlocated, taking it from the republic in which Amsterdam was located.&#160; On \r\nNovember 1, 1800, the company named Joseph Ellicott as their local agent, in \r\ncharge of the sale of the land he had surveyed.&#160; Settlement was initially slow \r\nbut picked up from about 1807 until the outbreak of the War of 1812.&#160; Some \r\nsettlers in present-day Niagara and Erie counties were devastated by that war.&#160; \r\nO. Turner, in his <em>Pioneer History of the Holland Purchase</em>, speaks of &#8220;the \r\nsmoking ruins of the once pleasant, delightful and flourishing village of \r\nBuffalo&#8221;[4] and describes refugees streaming into Canandaigua.&#160; </p>\r\n<strong>The \r\nMiddle Years</strong><p>Recovery from the war seems to have been speedy.&#160; Even so, lack of access to \r\nmarkets and the resulting shortage of cash meant that the majority of settlers \r\nbecame delinquent in their payments. Economic depression in 1819 further slowed \r\nsales and payments.&#160; Joseph Ellicott became involved in local politics, leading \r\nto difficulties for the company.&#160; In 1821, Paul Busti demanded, and received, \r\nEllicott&#8217;s resignation. </p>\r\n<p>Ellicott&#8217;s successor was Jacob S.

In 1833 the legislature passed a law taxing \r\nthe company for debts still owing to it upon land sales.&#160; Efforts to collect \r\narrears were largely ignored.&#160; Newspaper articles were published painting the \r\ncompany as composed of evil, grasping foreigners.&#160; The settlers tried, \r\nunsuccessfully, to challenge the company&#8217;s title to the land, and soon the \r\ncompany carefully began to divest itself of its holdings in New York.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>In 1834, some mortgages newly subject to taxation were sold to the New York \r\nLife Insurance &amp; Trust Company.&#160; Evans recommended selling a few of the more \r\ntroublesome townships in order to demonstrate that the new landlord would not be \r\nan improvement.&#160; In the summer of 1835 three townships were sold: Orangeville in \r\nGenesee County (T9R2), Charlotte in Chautauqua County (T4R11), and Boston in \r\nErie County (T7R8).&#160; In the same year, men interested in a projected Erie \r\nRailroad[7] bought reverted and unsold land in Allegany and Cattaraugus \r\ncounties, and the towns of Java and China in Genesee County. The Farmers Loan \r\n&amp; Trust Company of New York bought out the interests in Erie, Orleans, \r\nNiagara, and Genesee counties.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>Paul Evans describes the settlers&#8217; change of heart.&#160; &#8220;When it became known \r\nearly in 1835 that the Company was making preparations to sell out its interest \r\nto native landlords, the news was greeted by the settlers with something like \r\nconsternation.&#160; Though they had been quick to criticize the faults of the \r\nCompany, most of them realized perfectly well that it had been extraordinarily \r\nlenient in its treatment of backward debtors.&#160; Petitions poured into the Batavia \r\noffice from the settlers praying the Company not to &#8216;sell them out&#8217;.&#160; &#8230;&#160; Had it \r\nnot been so serious it would have been comic.&#160; Those who had protested most \r\nloudly in the past years were now rushing to get deeds before the Holland \r\ncompany should turn them over to the tender mercies of the native landlords.[8] \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Remaining lands and securities in Chautauqua County were sold to Trumbull \r\nCary and George Lay of Batavia.&#160; Company agents Evans and Vanderkemp could \r\nscarcely believe the favorable terms they were offered and readily agreed.&#160; \r\nThese new proprietors made the same demands &#8211; that back interest and deferred \r\npayments be paid.&#160; They also offered, like the Holland Land Company, to renew \r\nexpired, unpaid contracts.&#160; However, the new contract would be based on \r\nthen-current land prices, not the price at the time of the original contract.&#160; \r\nThey threatened to evict the current occupant and sell the land to a new tenant \r\nif payments were not made.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The settlers refused and on February 6, 1836, they destroyed the land office \r\nin Mayville, Chautauqua County.&#160; This led to the fortification of the land \r\noffice in Batavia, which staved off a similar mob attack.&#160; Some leniency on the \r\npart of the new proprietors, a new local agent in Mayville, and the passage of \r\ntime eventually restored calm.&#160; The estimated profit to the Holland Land Company \r\nshareholders was five to six percent per year.</p>\r\n<strong>Bibliography</strong><p>&#8226; <em>Pioneer History of the Holland Purchase</em>; O.

Henry ", "country": "New York", "title": "The Phelps-Gorham Purchase", "content": "<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Opening of western New York State to \r\nsettlement after the Revolutionary War was impeded because ownership of the land \r\nwas contested -- this region, the &#8220;Genesee country,&#8221; was long claimed by both \r\nMassachusetts and New York. Gen. John Sullivan, who led his army on an \r\nexpedition to subdue the Indians in 1779, had explored the region. When his \r\nsoldiers returned to Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and eastern New \r\nYork, they brought back a favorable opinion of the land. The conflicting claims \r\nof ownership prevented legal purchase, though. Resolution of the dispute became \r\nmore urgent. When the matter was finally resolved, in 1787, the right to sell a \r\n2.6 million acre tract lying between the so-called &#8220;preemption line&#8221; on the east \r\nand the Genesee River on the west eventually devolved to Oliver Phelps and \r\nNathaniel Gorham, prominent Massachusetts businessmen, and their company of \r\ninvestors. This company suffered financial reverses and, after less than two \r\nyears, transferred all unsold holdings to Robert Morris in 1790. Nevertheless, \r\nPhelps and Gorham had sold approximately half of their original purchase, and \r\nthe settlement of the Genesee country was well underway.<br><br><strong>The States' \r\nClaims</strong><br>A confusing collection of contradictory royal charters from James \r\nI, Charles I, and Charles II, mixed with a succession of treaties with the Dutch \r\nand with the Indians, made the legal situation intractable. Massachusetts \r\nasserted priority of charter on the disputed claims. All the land on the eastern \r\ncoast from 34th to 45th parallel was granted by James I in 1606 to the London \r\nCompany and the Virginia Company. The colonists of Plymouth, Massachusetts, had \r\ngotten their charter from the Virginia Company, but settled in land belonging to \r\nthe London Company. So in 1620 James I granted land from 40th to 48th parallel \r\nfrom sea to sea to the council in Plymouth, England, which issued a sub-grant in \r\n1621 to the colonists. In 1628 the same council issued another sub-grant, also \r\nrunning from sea to sea, to the Boston Company. Both of these charters expressly \r\nexcepted &#8220;all lands actually possessed and inhabited by an other Christian \r\nprince or state.&#8221; This became a point of debate.<br><br>New York based its right \r\nto the region on Henry Hudson&#8217;s claim of New Netherlands for Holland in 1609, \r\nwhich predates the 1620 and 1628 grants of Massachusetts. The western boundary \r\nwas based on Indian treaties<sup>[1]</sup>. New York pointed out that all of the \r\nIndian treaties had been obtained through the efforts of officials of New York, \r\ndeeds were witnessed by New York officials, no other colony was mentioned in the \r\ntreaties, and that New York paid treaty expenses. In 1640 Charles II granted New \r\nNetherlands to his brother, the Duke of York and Albany, later James II. New \r\nYork claimed that when England took over the Dutch holdings in 1640, New York \r\nsucceeded to the Dutch claim. Massachusetts agreed with this but claimed that \r\nthe Dutch had not actually settled territory west of the Mohawk, and so that \r\nterritory was not subject to the exemption stated in the 1620 and 1628 grants. \r\nMassachusetts also argued that the grant of Charles II did not define a western \r\nboundary and that the Indians had not ceded anything directly to New \r\nYork.<br><br><strong>Resolution of the Dispute</strong><br>The states&#8217; positions were \r\nentrenched, and no mutually acceptable agreement appeared likely. In May 1784 \r\nMassachusetts appealed to the federal government, at that time the Continental \r\nCongress, self-styled final arbiter of disputes between states. Massachusetts \r\nasked congress to appoint commissioners, whose decision would be final. Instead, \r\nCongress directed that the states appoint their own commissioners and have them \r\nappear before Congress to argue the case. When the commissioners appeared before \r\nCongress the following December, they were instructed to agree upon judges to \r\nhear the case. This was done by the following June. But the judges backed out \r\nbefore the case could be heard, and Congress agreed to postpone the case. The \r\ntwo state legislatures empowered their commissioners to settle the matter. After \r\ntwo and a half years of congressional inaction, the commissioners settled the \r\ndispute in two weeks at Hartford in December 1786<sup>[2]</sup>. Massachusetts \r\nsurrendered her claim to the government, sovereignty, and jurisdiction of the \r\nentire state. New York conceded to Massachusetts the right of pre-emption to the \r\nsoil (subject to Indian title) for that part of the state lying west of the \r\npreemption line<sup>[3]</sup>. That meant that Massachusetts had the right to \r\nbuy the land from the Indians and could sell this right to individuals. If, \r\nhowever, Massachusetts sold the preemption right, the grantee had to have any \r\ntreaty with the Indians confirmed by Massachusetts. Furthermore, when the land \r\nwas purchased from the Indians -- recorded in the office of New York&#8217;s secretary \r\nof state -- it would become part of New York. The two state legislatures \r\nratified the agreement and submitted it to Congress for approval.<br><br><strong>The \r\nPhelps-Gorham Purchase</strong><br>On 1 April 1787 Massachusetts sold to Nathaniel \r\nGorham, Oliver Phelps, and their associates pre-emption right to six and a \r\nquarter million acres west of the preemption line, subject to the Indian title. \r\nBy treaty with the Indians, signed 8 July 1788, the associates, acting through \r\nOliver Phelps, purchased a tract of land bounded on the north by Lake Ontario, \r\non the south by the Pennsylvania border<sup>[4]</sup>, on the east by the \r\npreemption line. On the west the boundary ran north from the Pennsylvania border \r\nto the confluence of Canaseraga creek and the Genesee River. Thence it followed \r\nthe river to a point two miles north of Canawagus village (the modern town of \r\nAvon), thence due west twelve miles, thence northward so as to be twelve miles \r\ndistant from the Genesee River to the shore of Lake Ontario. The land was \r\ndivided into ranges six miles wide running from north to south. Range 1 thus ran \r\nalong the preemption line. Range 7 ran along the Genesee River. The ranges were \r\ndivided into townships six miles square running from east to west. Township 1 \r\nlay on the Pennsylvania border. Township 14 bordered Lake Ontario. Thus the \r\nmajority of the parcels, except those around the river, were squares six miles \r\non a side. When Phelps bought the land from the Indians, Massachusetts had to \r\nconfirm the sale, but the land became part of New York. Massachusetts confirmed \r\ntheir title of land east of the Genesee River on 21 November 1788. (The Indians \r\nwere not willing at that time to sell land west of the Genesee.)<br><br>There \r\nwas a rival claim to the territory by an association of influential New York \r\nbusinessmen -- the New York Genesee Land Company, more familiarly known as &#8220;the \r\nLessees.&#8221; Their claim was based on a lease, obtained on 30 November 1787, of all \r\nthe lands of the Six Nations. Legislatures of both New York and Massachusetts \r\nrefused to recognize the validity of the lease. Nevertheless, the intrigues of \r\nthis group persisted. Phelps agreed to convey four townships to them (townships \r\n6, 7, and 8, range 1; and township 9 range 2) in exchange for a release of their \r\nclaim. Phelps and Gorham reserved for themselves township 10, range 3, at the \r\nnorthern end of Canandaigua Lake, and township 9, range 7, the current town of \r\nGeneseo.<br><br><strong>Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham</strong><br>Oliver Phelps was \r\nborn in Windsor, Connecticut, on 21 October 1749. He married Mary Seymour, \r\ndaughter of Zachariah and Sarah (Steele) Seymour. Mary was born in Hartford on \r\n16 November 1752 and died in Canandaigua, New York, on 13 September 1826. In \r\n1770 the couple settled in Granville, Massachusetts. They had one son, Oliver \r\nLeicester (b. 22 September 1775, married Betsey Law Sherman; d. at Canandaigua, \r\nNew York, 9 October 1813; seven children) and a daughter, Mary (b. 5 September \r\n1778; married Amasa Jackson; d. 11 September 1859 in New York City; two \r\nchildren).<br><br>Oliver Phelps fought at the battle of Lexington and served in \r\nthe Commissary department of the Colonial army. After the Revolution he moved to \r\nSuffield, Massachusetts. He was a prominent businessman and was involved in \r\nstate and national politics. He was a member of the Massachusetts State \r\nAssembly, a State Senator, and a member of the Governor&#8217;s council. He organized \r\nthe Phelps-Gorham partnership in 1788 and was their active agent in all \r\nexplorations and negotiations. He relocated in Canandaigua in 1802. He served as \r\nthe first judge of Ontario County from its erection in 1789 until 1793. He \r\nserved as a New York state representative from 1803 to 1805. He died in \r\nCanandaigua on 21 February 1809.<br><br>Nathaniel Gorham was born in \r\nCharlestown, Massachusetts, on 27 May 1738, the son of Captain Nathaniel Gorham \r\nand Mary Soley. In 1763 he married Rebecca Call, daughter of Caleb Call. They \r\nhad seven (one source says nine) children including Nathaniel, Rebecca, Mary, \r\nElizabeth Ann, John Benjamin, and Lydia. He became a prominent merchant and was \r\ninvolved for most of his adult life in public affairs. He was a member of the \r\nColonial legislature 1771-75 and a delegate to the Provincial Congress in 1774 \r\nand 1775. He was a member of the Board of War 1778-81. He was a member of the \r\nstate Constitutional Convention in 1779 and a delegate to the Continental \r\nCongress 1782-83 and 1785-87, being elected president of that body in June 1786. \r\nNathaniel Gorham never settled in the Genesee Country. His affairs in New York \r\nwere handled by his son Nathaniel Gorham, Jr., who moved to Canandaigua in 1789. \r\nNathaniel Gorham died in Charleston, Massachusetts, of apoplexy on 1 June \r\n1796.<br><br><strong>Sale of Parcels to Speculators and Emigrants</strong><br>Original \r\nland purchase was often for speculation, rather than settlement. The land was \r\noften resold quickly, and the original purchaser( s) did not always emigrate. \r\nFor example, Oliver Phelps sold township 3, range 2, to Prince Bryant of \r\nPennsylvania on 5 September 1789. A month later, on 2 October 1789, Prince \r\nBryant sold the land to Elijah Babcock, who sold various parcels to Roger Clark, \r\nSamuel Tooker, David Holmes, and William Babcock.<br><br>Also, the original \r\nsettlers were not always successful. With partial payment they received \r\n&#8220;articles of sale&#8221; instead of deeds; if they could not make the necessary \r\npayments, the land reverted to Phelps and was sold again. The table below lists \r\noriginal sales to speculators and settlers between April 1788 and November 1790 \r\ntabulated according to township and range numbers.</p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\" width=\"90%\" class=\"contentTableText\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"30%\" class=\"Normal\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Township, Range, Town</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"40%\" class=\"Normal\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Purchaser</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"30%\" class=\"Normal\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Notes</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"30%\" class=\"Normal\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">short range, 2A, Rochester</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"40%\" class=\"Normal\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Ebenezer Hunt, Robert Breck, Quartus \r\nPomeroy,Samuel Henshaw, Samuel Hinckley, Moses, Kingsley, Justin Ely</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"30%\" class=\"Normal\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">from Springfield and Northampton, \r\nMass.</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"30%\" class=\"Normal\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">short range, 2C, Charlotte</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"40%\" class=\"Normal\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Joseph Smith, Horatio Jones</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"30%\" class=\"Normal\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">bounded by Genesee River and Lake \r\nOntario</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td width=\"30%\" class=\"Normal\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">T1, R2, Lindley</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td width=\"40%\" class=\"Normal\"><p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Col.

Fewer emigrants \r\nthan anticipated reduced the income from land sales. Moreover, a rise in the \r\nvalue of the consolidated securities effectively increased the amount of their \r\ndebt to four times what they had originally expected. Thus, at the end of the \r\nfirst year they were unable to meet their obligation. Two of the three bonds \r\nwere canceled and the third bond was reduced to less than one-third of its \r\noriginal amount. In order to meet even this reduced obligation, the syndicate \r\nwas obliged to sell the lands they had not disposed of to Robert Morris on 18 \r\nNovember 1790. This amounted to about half of the original Phelps-Gorham \r\npurchase. The Commonwealth took back the preemption right of the lands west of \r\nthe Genesee River (which the Indians were not willing to sell) on 10 March 1791. \r\nThe state then sold the pre-emption right to this western portion to Robert \r\nMorris the next day, 11 March 1791. This land became known as the Holland \r\nPurchase because Robert Morris sold it to that group of Dutch bankers with the \r\nunderstanding that he, Morris, would extinguish Indian title (i.e., purchase it \r\nfrom the Indians through treaty), which he finally did in 1797.<br><br>As part \r\nof the agreement with Robert Morris the survey of the Phelps-Gorham purchase was \r\nrepeated and found to be seriously in error (one source suggests it was \r\ndeliberate). The pre-emption line was straightened to include the town of \r\nGeneva. An equivalent acreage on the west, the Triangle Tract, was returned to \r\nthe Indians. In less than a year Morris&#8217;s London agents sold the tract, at more \r\nthan double the price, to three Englishmen, Sir William Pulteney, William \r\nHornby, and Patrick Colquhoun. Since at the time non-citizens could not legally \r\nhold title to land, Charles Williamson was sent from Scotland and naturalized to \r\nhold the land in trust for the owners. Williamson established his own office in \r\nBath, which he named for Sir William&#8217;s daughter Laura, the countess of Bath. \r\nThere he continued the work of opening up the Genesee Country to \r\nsettlement.<br><br><strong>Footnotes</strong> </p>\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>Note that the western boundary had been decided with the conclusion of the \r\nRevolutionary War.

This material is useful to writers, historians, \r\nscholars, but not genealogists.&#160; In Appendix A of the guide, &#8220;Conducting \r\nGenealogical and Local History Research in Civil War Records in the New York \r\nState Archives,&#8221; it is stated: &#8220;Three record series out of the many records \r\ndescribed in this guide may be especially helpful to researchers seeking \r\ninformation on individual soldiers or sailors from New York who served in the \r\nCivil War&#8221; [p. 93].&#160; It is true that the three series, described below, contain \r\ngenealogical information perhaps useful to a large number of genealogists, but \r\nthere are other records with just as much information for a smaller subset.&#160; For \r\nexample, if your ancestor was an officer in the 1<sup>st</sup> to \r\n13<sup>th</sup> Regiments of New York State Volunteers, you want Series A4152, \r\n&#8220;Roster of Officers of New York State Volunteer Regiments 1861-1862.&#8221;&#160; Ranks \r\ninclude second lieutenant up to colonel and surgeon, assistant surgeon, \r\nchaplain, adjutant, and quartermaster.&#160; Or, if your ancestor served in the \r\n51<sup>st</sup> regiment, you can look for Series A0087, &#8220;Records of the \r\n51<sup>st</sup> Regiment, New York State Volunteers, 1861-1864,&#8221;which include \r\nmedical discharges, leaves of absence, payrolls, etc. </p>\r\n<p>The only record series that contains extensive genealogical \r\ninformation is Series 13774, &#8220;Town and City Registers of Men Who Served in the \r\nCivil War,&#8221; created by the Bureau of Military Statistics.&#160; The description in \r\nthe guide reads: </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;These registers are printed forms issued by the bureau of Military Record \r\nand completed by the state&#8217;s town and city clerks pursuant to Chapter 690 of the \r\nLaws of 1865.&#160; The registers provide the individual&#8217;s full name, residence, date \r\nand place of birth, present rank, regiment and company, dates of enlistment and \r\nmuster, rank, length of enlistment, place of enlistment, race, amount of bounty \r\npaid by town or bounty if disbursed by supervisor, marital status, previous \r\noccupation, parents&#8217; names, and dates of any promotions, resignations, \r\ndischarges or deaths&#8221; [p. 57].&#160; </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The good news is that there is an index.&#160; The bad news is \r\nthat data are missing for many major communities such as New York City, \r\nBrooklyn, Buffalo, Rochester, Utica, etc.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>An extremely large record series (1,363 volumes) to mine for \r\ninformation is Series 13775, &#8220;Civil War Muster Roll Abstracts of New York State \r\nVolunteers, United States Sharpshooters, and United States Colored Troops,&#8221; \r\ncreated by the Bureau of Records of the War of the Rebellion.&#160; The description \r\nis as follows: </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Arrangement: By branch of service (artillery, cavalry, infantry) and therein \r\nnumerically by unit number.&#160; Entries for each unit are arranged alphabetically \r\nby last name of officer or enlisted man.&#160; The abstracts are printed forms filled \r\nout during the late 1880s through the early 1900s from original military \r\nrecords&#8230; For each individual the following information is included: date of \r\nenlistment, age (in years), place of enlistment and for how long, date mustered \r\nin, grade, company and regiment, date left organization, how, in what grade, \r\nexplanation, and remarks.&#8221; [pp. 65-6]&#160; </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Archives has an unpublished seventeen-volume personal \r\nname index for this series. </p>\r\n<p>The third series selected by the guide as having general \r\ngenealogical interest is Series A0389, &#8220;Registers of Officers and Enlisted Men \r\nMustered into Federal Military or Naval Service During the Civil War,&#8221; a \r\nsix-volume set created, again, by the Bureau of Military Statistics.&#160; The \r\ndescription is as follows: </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;These folio-sized volumes provide both military and civil information on New \r\nYork men mustered into federal military or naval service during the Civil War.&#160; \r\nMuch of the information in the series was compiled from questionnaires \r\ndistributed by the bureau to the soldiers themselves, friends, relatives, \r\nmedical officers in charge of United States hospitals, and local officials &#8230; \r\nbetween 1683 and 1867 &#8230; three types of categories: New York Volunteers in \r\nservice, New York Volunteers formerly in service, and New York volunteers \r\ndeceased. &#8230; The first subseries &#8230;[consists of] three volumes that provide \r\ninformation on individuals who were still in federal service when the data was \r\ncollected.&#160; Information provided includes; county, town, village, or city \r\n(including ward number); name, age, and color; place of birth; marital status; \r\ntrade or occupation; voter or alien; ability to read or write;

</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, there are no indexes. </p>\r\n<p>The Bureau of Military Statistics, responsible for collecting \r\nand compiling Civil War records, was created on April 8, 1863, with an initial \r\nappropriation of $6000.&#160; Bureau chief Lockwood Lyon Doty, was required to \r\n&#8220;collect and preserve an authentic sketch of every person from this state who \r\nhas volunteered into the service of the general government since April 15, 1861 \r\nand likewise a record of the service of the several regiments&#8221; [p. 17].&#160; Doty, \r\nhowever, had a grander vision.&#160; In his first annual report he declared his \r\nintention to collect &#8220;every fact relating to the rebellion, and especially to \r\nthe part which New York has taken in the war, whether now recorded or printed, \r\nor still existing in memory&#8221; [p. 17].&#160; He developed a one-page double-sided form \r\nthat asked the following questions of the soldiers: </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>date and place of enlistment </li>\r\n<li>regiment </li>\r\n<li>company (or ship) and rank </li>\r\n<li>promotions or transfers </li>\r\n<li>previous military history in the militia or U.S. Regular \r\nArmy, Navy, or European </li>\r\n<li>military organizations </li>\r\n<li>battles or skirmishes participated in during the Civil War \r\n</li>\r\n<li>descriptions of wounds received or illnesses contracted \r\nwhile in the service </li>\r\n<li>date of discharge or death </li>\r\n<li>date and place of birth </li>\r\n<li>parents&#8217;

In spite of its size, the Vosburgh \r\nCollection cannot be considered a statewide database.&#160; The emphasis is on early \r\ncongregations, rather than early records.&#160; The churches included are located \r\nalmost exclusively in the valleys surrounding the Hudson and Mohawk rivers, \r\nwhere the earliest settlements in the state were located.&#160; However, many of the \r\ntranscriptions extend into the twentieth century.&#160; The collection has been \r\nmicrofilmed and is available in the NEHGS library, the library of the New York \r\nGenealogical and Biographical Society (NYG&amp;BS), the New York State library, \r\nand in some public libraries.&#160;&#160;Films are&#160;available at the Family History Library \r\n(and local Family History Centers).</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>Royden Woodward Vosburgh became archivist and historian of the New York \r\nGenealogical and Biographical Society in 1913.&#160; The following biographical \r\ninformation was extracted from an obituary published in the <em>New York \r\nGenealogical and Biographical Record</em> in 1932.[i] </p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Royden Woodward Vosburgh, a Life Member of the New York Genealogical and \r\nBiographical Society, died &#8230; on May 18, 1931.&#160; &#8230; Mr. Vosburgh was born Feb. 5, \r\n1875, at Buffalo, New York, the son of William Henry Vosburgh and his wife \r\nCaroline Estelle Woodward. &#8230; He was educated at the Brown and Nichols School in \r\nCambridge, Massachusetts, and at Harvard University, 1893-1896. &#8230; In 1913 Mr. \r\nVosburgh became the archivist of the New York Genealogical and Biographical \r\nSociety, and devoted much of his time to make carefully prepared copies of the \r\nchurch records of the State of New York.&#160; His services enriched the Society with \r\nthe records of 92 churches, occupying 101 volumes. &#8230;&#160; In the <em>Records</em> for \r\nJan. 1918 (Vol. 49, pp. 11-16) and April, 1921 (Vol. 52, pp. 152-157) are listed \r\nthe church records copied by Mr. Vosburgh. &#8230; Mr. Vosburgh was connected with the \r\nStaten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences, and edited for that Society nine \r\nvolumes of Staten Island church and gravestone records.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The NEHGS library holds a copy of the thirteen-reel NYG&amp;BS filming of the \r\ncollection. Its call number is F118/V67/1913.&#160; While there is no index to the \r\ncollection, the NEHGS library has a copy of <em>A guide to Vosburgh church \r\nrecords on microfilm</em>, by Robert M. Murphy (Microtext REF F118/M86/1999). The \r\nmajority of the records begin in the mid to late eighteenth century.&#160; Some \r\nrecords cover a relatively short time span, such as Round Top Lutheran Church of \r\nPine Plains in Dutchess County (1760-1788).&#160; Other records extend into the \r\ntwentieth century, such as First Lutheran Church of Albany (1774-1901) or First \r\nReformed Church of West Coxsackie in Greene County (1738-1918).</p>\r\n<p>The catalogue entries at the Connecticut State Library for this filming are \r\nparticularly complete.&#160; For example, the entry for the Reformed Dutch Church of \r\nStone Arabia, in the town of Palatine, Montgomery County, contains the following \r\ndescription of the contents:[ii] </p>\r\n<blockquote><p><em>Contents</em>&#160; v. 1 : Baptisms and births, Oct. 14, 1739-Jan. 31, 1796. \r\nMarriages, Oct. 16, 1739-1795.

J. Wack.&#8221;[iii] &#160; The following extract from the introduction to his \r\n&#8220;Abstracts from the minutes of the consistory&#8221; gives some idea of how extensive \r\nthis additional material can be.<br><br>Taken as a whole, this abstract with the \r\nnotes, gives every fact worthy of note, concerning the history of this church \r\nfor three score years.&#160; It contains all the documentary data relating to the \r\nbuilding of, and the repairs made, to the present church edifice; the \r\nconsecration of the church, its admission to the Classis[iv] of Albany; and \r\npresents authoritatively for the first time, the facts concerning the suspension \r\nand deposition of the Rev. John J. Wack. [Rev. Wack was accused of repeated \r\ndrunkenness and profanity.]&#160; This latter phase of the church history is in \r\nitself a most interesting study, and it shows that the members of the Classis of \r\nMontgomery, by whose acts the Stone Arabia Church became independent for about \r\nten years, were the same band of malcontents who finally organized the True \r\nReformed Dutch Church.&#160; In short, what follows presents the primary sources of \r\ninformation from which the history of the church must be written.[v] &#160; </p>\r\n<p>The version available at the Family History Library presents the same \r\ninformation in sixty-one reels instead of thirteen.&#160; The Family History Library \r\ndoes not have a copy of Murphy&#8217;s guide, but does have an <em>Index to the \r\nVosburgh collection of the early church records of the state of New York</em> \r\n(#1697744, item 27).&#160; The FHL catalog entries list the names of the churches \r\nincluded in each of the sixty-one reels.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The following table lists the relevant congregations, collected by county, \r\ntogether with the dates for which records were transcribed.&#160; From this a \r\nresearcher should be able to evaluate the relevance of this collection to his \r\nwork.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Table I: Churches Forming the \r\nVosburgh

Fortunately that job is \r\ngetting easier, although challenges remain. </p>\r\n<p>The challenges arise from the fact that vital statistics were not kept until \r\nthe late nineteenth century and church records are sparse. Some records were \r\nkept by traveling ministers and cannot be located today. People moved often, \r\nmaking it difficult to find the records they left behind. </p>\r\n<p>New Englanders moved into the Hudson River Valley, particularly Dutchess \r\nCounty, in the mideighteenth century.[1] After the Revolutionary War, settlers \r\nmoved into more areas, such as the southern New York counties along the \r\nSusquehanna River.However, it was after the War of 1812 that migration really \r\nstarted. My Benson family left Danby, Vermont, in 1816 for Jefferson County, New \r\nYork. My wife&#8217;s Read family coincidentally also lived in Danby and left in 1818 \r\nfor Chautauqua County,New York. </p>\r\n<p>As this growth continued, new counties and towns were formed. A settler might \r\nbe listed in Tioga County in the 1820 census and in Tompkins County in the 1830 \r\ncensus without having moved.The town of Caroline was formed from Spencer, Tioga \r\nCounty, in 1811 and transferred to Tompkins County in 1822. An essential \r\nresearch tool is French&#8217;s <em>Gazetteer</em>.[2] French tracks the formation of \r\neach county and town, indicating also the counties and towns from which each was \r\nformed. It is necessary to understand such changes in order to know where to \r\nlook for census, land, probate, and cemetery records.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><img height=\"183\" align=\"right\" width=\"178\" style=\"width: 178px; height: 183px;\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/New_York/upstate_quote1.gif\" alt=\"As this growth continued, new counties and towns were formed.

A settler might be listed in Tioga County in the 1820 census and in Tompkins County in the 1830 census without having moved.\">Sometimes researchers do not know the county in which to search. They may \r\nhave seen a census record that merely says &#8220;born in New York State.&#8221;The first \r\nstep is to try to find sources that identify the town or county. Death \r\ncertificates, gravestones, or obituaries might help. Sometimes county histories \r\nprofile residents and tell from where they came.The first deed outside New York \r\nmay identify an ancestor as &#8220;now of Jackson County, Michigan, previously of \r\nJefferson County,New York.&#8221; If the name is unusual, finding someone in a New \r\nYork census index may be possible.The downside of unusual names is that they are \r\noften spelled differently in different records. Of course, if the name is John \r\nBrown, there will be many entries in census records and it will be difficult to \r\ntell which, if any, relates to the appropriate family. </p>\r\n<p>Sometimes records in your own home or in the home of a relative may have the \r\nanswers. For years I tried to identify the parents of my wife&#8217;s ancestor, Mary \r\nJane Herrick, who died in Chautauqua County,New York, in 1856 after marrying \r\nthere in 1844. I tried to trace dozens of Herrick families that had lived in the \r\ncounty, without success. It was only when reading a family diary from the 1890s \r\nthat a reference to Aunt Libbie and Uncle William Herrick of Erie County, \r\nPennsylvania, was noted.Their father, Ezekiel Herrick, had been a carpenter and \r\nmoved from county to county without buying land.There was no trace of him in \r\nChautauqua County. Records in Erie County, Pennsylvania, helped make the \r\nidentification. </p>\r\n<p><img align=\"left\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 183px;\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/New_York/upstate_research2lg.gif\" alt=\"Upstate Research 02\" title=\"Upstate Research 02\">Census \r\nrecords are now easier to use in tracking families.They used to require \r\ncombining whole rolls of microfilm in large libraries, using often incomplete or \r\ninaccurate printed indexes. Now indexed copies of census records for all \r\navailable years are online. Certain years have been indexed by \r\n<em>Ancestry.com</em> and others by <em>HeritageQuestOnline.com</em>. Access to \r\nthe indexes and census page images on both websites is available for a fee. Many \r\nlibraries have subscriptions. The 1880 census is online at \r\n<em>FamilySearch.org</em>. Starting with 1850, the census lists all household \r\nmembers, and in 1880 it also shows where each person&#8217;s parents were born.The \r\nU.S. census records begin in 1790 and are available for every ten years (except \r\n1890, for which the records were lost to fire). Also helpful are New York State \r\ncensus records, available for some counties as early as 1825 and every ten years \r\nthereafter. </p>\r\n<p>Once a county is identified for your ancestor, land and probate records for \r\nthat county need to be searched. Visiting the county courthouse can be an \r\nadventure. However, most of us settle for borrowing microfilms of these records \r\nat a local Family History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \r\nSaints. The first deeds may show from whence a settler moved. Later deeds may \r\nidentify children to whom land was deeded. Not all deeds were recorded. In some \r\nareas the original purchases are not available in the county clerk&#8217;s office, \r\nparticularly if made through the Holland Land Company or other large \r\nlandowners.[3] </p>\r\n<p><img align=\"left\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/New_York/upstate_quote2gif.gif\" alt=\"Upstate Quote 02\" title=\"Upstate Quote 02\">Probate records are in the County Surrogate Court&#8217;s office in New \r\nYork, rather than in a probate court. Beginning around 1830, they may show names \r\nof heirs and where they were living.[4] A good guide to these records is Gordon \r\nRemington, <em>New York State Probate Records: A Guide to Testate and Intestate \r\nRecords</em>, published by NEHGS in 2002.Not much is online; most probate \r\nrecords will have to be ordered on microfilm from the Family History Library.[5] \r\nWhen checking the Family History Library catalog at <em>FamilySearch.org</em> \r\nfor probate data, be sure to check what other types of records are available for \r\nthe county and town. </p>\r\n<p>&#160;</p>\r\n<p><em></em></p>\r\n<p>Some vital records have been published in newspapers. Thousands of \r\nmarriage and death notices have been transcribed and published by Fred Q. \r\nBowman.[6] Other newspaper extracts have been published for Washington and \r\nSteuben counties. </p>\r\n<p><img height=\"749\" width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 749px;\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/New_York/upstate_research3.gif\" alt=\"Some Major New York Sources In the NEHGS Library\" title=\"Some Major New York Sources In the NEHGS Library\"><br><br>In the absence \r\nof vital records, cemetery data can be very valuable. The good news is that \r\nwebsites for the New York counties on the USGenWeb project, hosted by \r\n<em>RootsWeb.com</em>, contain more and more transcriptions of cemetery records. \r\nThese websites may also contain census and other primary records. In some cases \r\nthe entire contents of the website can be searched for a name. </p>\r\n<p>Other cemetery records are available through &#8220;New York DAR Cemetery, Church \r\nand Town Records,&#8221; a multi-volume manuscript in the State Library in Albany and \r\nthe DAR Library in Washington, DC.[7] Other church records, tombstone \r\ninscriptions, and family records were published in <em>Early Settlers of New \r\nYork State</em>.[8] </p>\r\n<p><img align=\"left\" style=\"width: 200px; height: 153px;\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/uploadedImages/American_Ancestors/Content/Articles/New_York/upstate_research4lg.gif\" alt=\"Duane House, Duane, New York, Duane Hamilton Hurd, History of Clinton and Franklin Counties, New York (1880)\" title=\"Duane House, Duane, New York, Duane Hamilton Hurd, History of Clinton and Franklin Counties, New York (1880)\">Many records are published in periodicals, particularly <em>The \r\nNew York Genealogical and Biographical Record</em> and <em>Tree Talks</em>. More \r\ngood news is the recent publication of Worden&#8217;s <em>Index to The New York \r\nGenealogical and Biographical Record 1870&#8211;1998</em>. This CD-ROM,available from \r\nThe New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, allows you to find your \r\nancestors in the 129 volumes of this periodical. The annual indexes to <em>Tree \r\nTalks</em> should be searched. I spent years looking for information about my \r\ngreat-great-great-grandfather, David Cook of Washington County,New York. But I \r\nfound no probate records or gravestone there. It turned out that six months \r\nbefore he died in 1824, he moved to live with a son in Genesee County, New York. \r\nHe wrote his will there. I found this information when I noticed his daughter, \r\nPhebe (Cook) Benson, listed in an index to <em>Tree Talks</em>. </p>\r\n<p>We often make fun of the &#8220;mug books.&#8221; These were county histories published \r\nin the last part of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They are \r\ncalled mug books because people submitted information and pictures (their \r\n&#8220;mugs&#8221;) of their families, then bought copies of the books. Much of the \r\ninformation provided on their early ancestry is suspect. However, for people \r\nliving at the end of the nineteenth century, data on immediate family members is \r\nusually accurate. Some of these &#8220;mug books&#8221; are being published on county \r\nwebsites. </p>\r\n<p>Family Bible records and obituaries are sometimes the only available sources \r\nfor upstate New York. The problem is where to find them. Some have been \r\npublished in sources described above; however, others may be sitting in \r\nsomeone&#8217;s attic. It is probably worthwhile to place queries on family message \r\nboards sponsored by <em>Ancestry.com</em> and <em>Genealogy.com</em>. There is \r\nalways a chance of finding a cousin with access to these records. </p>\r\n<p>With more data online and more indexes available, upstate New York research \r\nis getting easier.[9] However, be aware that undocumented genealogies available \r\nonline often contain errors. Stay with primary source records such as census \r\nlistings, wills, deeds, church records, and cemetery data.

The \r\nindexes cover the entire state outside of New York City and start in June 1880 \r\n(deaths) or 1881 (marriages and births). Birth indexes are made available at the \r\nArchives after 75 years; marriage and death indexes after 50 years. An index \r\nentry records only the name of the person, date and place of event, and state \r\ncertificate number. The New York State Archives does not hold birth, marriage, \r\nand death certificates--only indexes to them. The State Department of Health and \r\nlocal registrars of vital statistics are authorized to furnish uncertified \r\ncopies of vital records for genealogical purposes. Data on living persons is \r\nrestricted by law.

At this Web site more specific information on each census is \r\navailable by clicking on the year. For example, clicking on the 1845 census \r\nyields the list of questions asked in the census and the note that many of the \r\nrecords have been lost or destroyed. Very few of the New York State censuses \r\nhave been indexed. A notable exception is Steuben County, for which all the \r\nnames in every census have been indexed. A master index list is available at the \r\ncourthouse in Bath, NY. Ontario County also has indexed the 1850 and 1860 \r\nfederal census and also the 1855 and 1865 state census. The LDS Family History \r\nLibrary has the most complete collection of films of the New York State \r\ncensus.</p>\r\n<p>There is some information available for early county census records: 1720 \r\nAlbany County census; 1714 Dutchess County census; 1702 Orange County census; \r\n1689 Ulster County census.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.com/~nygenweb/\" target=\"_new\"><strong>The New York \r\nState Site of the USGenWeb Project</strong></a><br>Choose your county of \r\ninterest from the drop down menu. A map is included. Quality varies from county \r\nto county. Usually you will find information on local history, a surname search \r\nfacility (very useful), maps, research services, and so on. For example, the \r\nGenWeb page for Monroe County contains links to \"Monroe County Genealogical \r\nResources\" with addresses of government offices and libraries and a list of \r\ngenealogical researchers in this area. The link to \"Monroe County Forums\" on \r\nRootsWeb allows you to post a query on your Monroe County family. \"Surname \r\nHelper\" is a method for finding query, biographical, and obituary Web sites \r\nstored on RootsWeb. You can see an alphabetic index of Monroe County surnames. \r\nYou can also search Monroe County surnames or search for a surname anywhere in \r\nthe world. The Monroe County section of <em>French's Gazetteer of New York</em> \r\n(1860) has interesting facts about each town in the county, including first \r\nsettlers and location of all hamlets and villages. The page of Monroe County \r\nplace names -- (alphabetical) from the US Geological Survey -- links you to a \r\nmap that includes cemeteries, schools, creeks, and hamlets.

Note that \r\nmany of the books of interest to genealogists will be considered reference \r\nmaterial. There are no copies for circulation. A search in this catalogue on \r\n\"genealogy, Monroe County\" gave me 47 hits. For example, I found that the \r\nlibrary collection includes a book entitled <em>The Ancestors and Descendants of \r\nAbigail Goodhue, Samuel Baker and Mary Ann Perry of Riga, Henrietta and \r\nWheatland, New York: and Several Collateral Families</em>, by June Constance \r\nFeder, revised in 1989 and published by the author. I also found a book entitled \r\n<em>Monroe County Vital Records, 1829-1846</em>, compiled by Karen E. Dau and \r\nprivately published in 1988.

Many of them are named by county \r\nor region, such as the Ulster County Genealogical Society, or the Northern New \r\nYork American-Canadian Genealogical Society. Others have a more ethnic slant, \r\nsuch as Palatines to America, New York Chapter. Some of the items on the list \r\nhave active links to the Web site of the organization. Counties listed include: \r\nChautauqua, Duchess, Jefferson, Livingston, Niagara, Orange, Queens, \r\nSchenectady, Tioga, Ulster, and Yates. </p>\r\n<p>Existing Web sites will generally list meeting dates, club activities, and a \r\nsurname list currently being researched by members. Here are three examples. The \r\nRochester Genealogical Society, concerned with the northern central part of the \r\nstate, the Capital District Genealogical Society, based at Albany, and the \r\nPolish Genealogical Society, which meets near Buffalo, in the western part of \r\nthe state. The <a href=\"http://home.eznet.net/~halsey/rgs.htm\" target=\"_new\">Rochester Genealogical Society</a> contains a list of surnames being \r\nresearched by RGS members and a more extensive site with more detailed family \r\nhistories, called \"Genesee Country Family File.\" The <a href=\"http://home.eznet.net/~halsey/NY/capital.htm\" target=\"_new\">Capital District \r\nGenealogical Society</a> has a newsletter which accepts queries.

The <a href=\"http://www.pgsnys.org/\" target=\"_new\">Polish \r\nGenealogical Society of New York State</a> was founded in 1988 and meets in East \r\nAurora, NY, a suburb of Buffalo. They print queries in their newsletter. \r\nPolish-English translations may also be obtained. In Spring of 1999 the PGSNYS \r\nbegan to index obituaries found in <em>Dziennik Dla Wszystkich</em> \r\n(<em>Everybody's Daily</em>). This Polish-American newspaper was published in \r\nBuffalo, New York, from 1911 to 1957 and contains many death notices of local \r\nPolish Immigrants, usually with the person's age and place of birth. There is \r\nalso a link to other sites with Polish genealogical information.</p>\r\n<p><strong>County Historical Societies</strong><br>Several county historical societies do \r\nhave Web sites. Here are two examples chosen at random. Ontario County, \r\noriginally one of the state's largest counties, is in the western part of the \r\nstate, in the Finger Lakes region. Schenectady County is a small county in the \r\neastern part of the state, along the Mohawk River.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ochs.org/\" target=\"_new\">The Ontario \r\nCounty Historical Society</a> site comes complete with a jazzy piano \r\naccompaniment for the homepage.

The bookstore invites inquiries. They will search if they do not have the \r\nbook you seek. The library holds some standard reference material such as \r\nfederal census record indexes, and more local references, such as Canandaigua \r\ncity directories. There are how-to books on genealogy, county histories, and \r\nsome unpublished genealogical records. Family history surnames, taken at random, \r\ninclude Ames, Bosley, and Churchill.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.schist.org/\" target=\"_new\">Schenectady County \r\nHistorical Society</a> site is the major genealogical resource for Schenectady \r\nCounty.

Among the area-specific holdings are church records, \r\nlisted by city, and a list of addresses and telephone numbers for cemeteries in \r\nthe county. The library is willing to undertake research for $15.00/hour. The \r\npage on resources contains an extensive list of links to people and places that \r\ncan provide genealogical information related to the county. The link for census \r\ninformation, for example, lists what state and federal census information is \r\navailable and where. The link to county, city, town, and village historians \r\nlists names and addresses of historians in the county.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Archives</strong><br>In addition to the State Archives, there are smaller \r\nregional archives. An archive's site should give you a card catalogue to be most \r\nuseful. Here is a look at the State Archives and a smaller, regional one.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.archives.nysed.gov/aindex.shtml\" target=\"_new\">New York State \r\nArchives</a> site provides information on location, hours, and parking. Request \r\nforms are readily available, but the forms require a signature, so you will have \r\nto send it by snail mail with your payment. You can find several guides to what \r\ninformation is available and how to get to it. There is an <a href=\"http://www.archives.nysed.gov/a/research/res_topics_genealogy.shtml\" target=\"_new\">online \r\ncatalogue</a> called <em>Excelsior</em>. According to the description, Excelsior \r\nprovides a fully-searchable index to all of the records series preserved in the \r\nState Archives. You can also search the database of the New York State Historic \r\nDocuments Inventory. You can search for records via keyword, creating agency or \r\ngovernment, and by subject. Excelsior is a shared catalog with the New York \r\nState Library and the State Library's Manuscripts and Special Collections \r\nUnit.</p>\r\n<p>My search on \"Macomb's Purchase\" yielded a single item -- a set of three land \r\nsurvey maps, 1798-1888. Part of the description of one of these maps states: \r\n</p>\r\n<p>12405-83: This single sheet tracing, dated about 1803, is a copy of a map of \r\nlots in the Arthursborough Patent in Montgomery County. The original map was \r\nfrom the land book of William Cooper, which passed into possession of his \r\ndescendent, James Fenimore Cooper. The purpose for which the tracing was made is \r\nunknown; the existence of a notarized statement indicates that the copy may have \r\nbeen provided to the state to fill in gaps in its land records. There is some \r\ndiscrepancy between information contained on the tracing and that found in the \r\ndocument that accompanies it. An attestation on the face of the tracing, signed \r\nby James Fenimore Cooper and dated May 10, 188[5], certifies that it is a copy \r\nof a map on page 57 of William Cooper's land book made between the years 1800 \r\nand 1810, which came to James Fenimore as the \"great grandson of said William \r\nCooper\". A separate sworn statement by James Fenimore Cooper to a notary, dated \r\nApril 8, 1888, accompanies the tracing. In it James Fenimore Cooper states that \r\nhe possesses the map as a grandson of William Cooper of Cooperstown, that the \r\nmap is marked with the initials of supposed purchasers of various lots in the \r\npatent, and that \"S. Wilder Esq\" has made a true copy of the original map, which \r\nis itself supposed to have been made between 1800 and 1805.</p>\r\n<p>The Rochester Regional Library Council maintains a <a href=\"http://www.rric.org/guide/\" target=\"New\">Guide to Local History and Archives \r\nCollections in the Genesee Valley, 1996</a>.

This independent spirit characterized politics during the \r\nAmerican Revolution, when Rhode Islanders declared themselves free of Great \r\nBritain in May 1776, two months before the rest of the colonies, and were the \r\nlast colony to ratify the Constitution and join the Union. In the nineteenth and \r\ntwentieth centuries immigrants from all over the world found employment in the \r\nstate&#8217;s manufacturing industry. </p>\r\n<p>Genealogists looking for records will find plenty from the colonial period to \r\nthe present.

Consult John C. Pease and John M. Niles&#8217; <em>A Gazeteer \r\nof the States of Connecticut and Rhode Island</em> (Hartford: William S. Marsh, \r\n1819) and Henry Gannett&#8217;s <em>Geographic Dictionary of Connecticut and Rhode \r\nIsland</em> (1894; reprint, Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 1978) or the \r\n<em>American Places Dictionary: A Guide to 45,000 Populated Places, Natural \r\nFeatures, and Other Places in the United States</em> 4 vols. (Detroit, Michigan: \r\nOmnigraphics, 1994) when confronted with a place you don&#8217;t recognize.</p>\r\n<p>&#8226; Rhode Island General Assembly Reports from 1800 to 1880 contain petition \r\nabstracts of adoptions, name changes, or divorces. See &#8220;Name Changes in Rhode \r\nIsland, 1800&#8211;1880,&#8221;<em> The New England Historical and Genealogical Register</em>, \r\nJuly 1995. These state reports also include residents of state schools or mental \r\ninstitutions, and inmates at the state prison. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Colonial </strong></p>\r\n<p>Records from Rhode Island&#8217;s four original towns &#8212; Providence, Warwick, \r\nNewport and Portsmouth &#8212; are extensive and readily available. Record-keeping \r\nbegan in the 1630s and a law in 1700 mandated what should be kept by town \r\nclerks. Town meeting records are available on microfilm from the Family History \r\nLibrary in Salt Lake City, and contain vital and land records, ear marks, \r\nlicenses, and records on the care of the poor. Many seventeenth-century town \r\ndocuments for Providence, Portsmouth, and Warwick have been published. <em>The \r\nEarly Town Records of Providence</em> by Horatio Rogers et al. (Providence, 1949) \r\nincludes references to individuals living in other towns, as does John Russell \r\nBartlett&#8217;s <em>Records of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations \r\n</em>(1863&#8211;1865; reprint New York, 1968).</p>\r\n<p>During the Colonial period, colonists and the native population co-existed, \r\nconducting trade and living in the same area until King Philip&#8217;s War \r\n(1675/1676). At the end of the war, tribal members were separated and given to \r\nthe settlers who participated in <br>the conflict. Those who fled the area \r\nmigrated first to New York and later to Brothertown, Wisconsin, where their \r\ndescendants still reside today.[1] The United States Government established a \r\nreservation for the Narragansett tribe that remained in existence until \r\n1881.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to Native Americans enslaved to the colonists, Rhode Island \r\nmerchants participated in the Triangle trade that brought slaves into the area \r\nfrom Africa and the West Indies. Manumission papers can be found amongst the \r\nQuaker records on deposit at the RIHS. Newspaper notices for runaway slaves have \r\nbeen transcribed.[2] Slavery was eliminated by gradual emancipation in \r\n1787.[3]</p>\r\n<p>During the American Revolution, British troops occupied Newport from 1776 to \r\n1779. When they evacuated, a ship carrying Newport&#8217;s town records sank, an \r\nirreparable loss. Settlers of Newport with Tory sympathies fled the island and \r\nformed a community called Newport in Nova Scotia.[4] Revolutionary land grants, \r\nfor those who served in the conflict, encouraged migration to New Hampshire, \r\nVermont, and New York.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Major resources</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Vital records</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>As early as 1647 the colonial government required all marriage banns to be \r\nrecorded on the town level, but compliance was probably less than fifty percent. \r\nTwo published series attempt to complete the missing records from the colonial \r\nperiod to 1850: James Arnold&#8217;s <em>Vital Record of Rhode Island</em> and Alden \r\nBeaman&#8217;s <em>Rhode Island Vital Records</em>.[5] The 1853 civil registration \r\nrequirement of vital records left a two-year gap, and coverage after passage was \r\ninconsistent. The RISA has special indexes to vital records &#8212; an index to \r\nresidents who died while out of state from 1900 to 1948 and one to delayed \r\nbirths from 1846 to 1898. RISA also has an index to recorded births from 1800 to \r\n1855 and one to marriages performed by justices of the peace from 1810 to 1866. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Access to birth and marriages records more than 101 years old and death \r\nrecords older than fifty-one years are available at RISA and NEHGS. More recent \r\nrecords can be found at the Office of Vital Records, Rhode Island Department of \r\nHealth, 3 Capitol Hill, Room 101, Providence, RI 02908-5097. Call 401-222-2811 \r\nfor current fees and restrictions. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Cemetery records</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>An index to the cemetery records compiled by the Rhode Island Cemetery \r\nTranscription Project is available online at \r\n<em>www.rootsweb.com/~rigenweb/cemetery</em> and at \r\n<em>NewEnglandAncestors.org</em>. The complete database is searchable at RIHS. \r\nInformation in the database is from earlier cemetery transcriptions, as well as \r\nthe markers themselves. Data is verified by the volunteers working on the \r\nproject. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Census records </em></strong></p>\r\n<p>At least five colonial population lists exist for the eighteenth century &#8212; \r\n1730, 1747 (actually a list of freeman), 1774, 1777 and 1782. Originals are at \r\nRISA or RIHS and all have been transcribed and published. State censuses were \r\ntaken at ten-year intervals between 1865 and 1935, although the 1895 returns \r\n(except Bristol) are missing. Card indexes exist for 1865 and 1875 while the \r\n1885, 1905, and 1935 censuses are self-indexed alphabetically by town. 1915 and \r\n1925 are arranged by street. There are four known local enumerations for \r\nProvidence &#8212; 1776, 1791, 1825, and 1845 (only half of the second ward). </p>\r\n<p>All existing federal population census records for Rhode Island are indexed \r\nwith the exception of 1910. An individual can be located by using city \r\ndirectories in conjunction with the census. Noteworthy is the existence of \r\nSpecial Schedules for Rhode Island at either the Rhode Island State Archive or \r\nthe Rhode Island Historical Society: agricultural, and mortality schedules exist \r\nfor 1850 to 1880 and manufacturing for 1850, 1860, and 1880. In the absence of \r\nthe population schedules for 1890 researchers can refer to the Special Schedules \r\nof the Eleventh Census Enumerating Union Veterans and Widows of Union Veterans \r\nof the Civil War (1890).</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Church records</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>A wide variety of religious groups gravitated to Rhode Island because the \r\ncolony was considered tolerant. In the seventeenth century, Roger Williams \r\nbrought his group of followers to Providence and founded the first Baptist \r\nChurch in America; they were followed by the Society of Friends (Quakers), \r\nFrench Huguenots, and Jews. </p>\r\n<p>Both RIHS and NHS include church records in their manuscripts departments. If \r\nyou can&#8217;t locate the records for a defunct parish, try contacting either \r\nhistorical society to see if the missing records might be there. RIHS has \r\nmiscellaneous church records for Protestant churches while NHS has a \r\ncomprehensive collection of records for Newport&#8217;s churches, including Trinity. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>If you are looking for a particular denomination, here&#8217;s a select outline of \r\nwhat&#8217;s available either in print or manuscript. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Anglican</strong></p>\r\n<p>&#8226; Wilkins Updike, <em>A History of the Episcopal Church in Narragansett, Rhode \r\nIsland</em> (1847; reprint, Boston: Merrymount Press, 1907) includes the parish \r\nregister for St. Paul&#8217;s for 1718 to 1774. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Baptist</strong></p>\r\n<p>&#8226; Records of the First Baptist Church of Rhode Island, founded by Roger \r\nWilliams in 1636, on deposit at RIHS, do not contain information of a \r\ngenealogical nature. </p>\r\n<p>&#8226; Contact the American Baptist Historical Society (Hamilton-Samuel Colgate \r\nBaptist Historical Collection, 1106 S. Goodman St., Rochester, NY 14620), for a \r\nlist of their holdings for Rhode Island churches. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Congregational</strong></p>\r\n<p>&#8226; The Congregational Library (14 Beacon St., Boston, MA 02108) has \r\nmiscellaneous material on Rhode Island parishes. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Episcopal</strong> </p>\r\n<p>&#8226; The records of the Episcopal diocese are located at the Special Collections \r\nDepartment, University Library, Kingston, RI. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Quaker</strong></p>\r\n<p>&#8226; The New England Yearly Meeting records are on deposit at the Rhode Island \r\nHistorical Society Library. These records cover all of Rhode Island, most of \r\nMassachusetts (except Nantucket), and parts of Connecticut, Maine, and New \r\nHampshire. Richard D. Stattler, <em>Guide to the Records of the Religious Society \r\nof Friends (Quakers) in New England</em> (Providence: RIHS, 1997) should be \r\nconsulted. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Huguenot</strong></p>\r\n<p>&#8226; The records of the French Huguenot settlement church of East Greenwich were \r\ntranslated and printed in the <em>New York Genealogical and Biographical \r\nRecord</em>.[6]</p>\r\n<p><strong>Jewish</strong></p>\r\n<p>&#8226; The papers of Aaron Lopez, one of the first Jews in Rhode Island, are at \r\nNHS.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Methodist</strong></p>\r\n<p>&#8226; Some records for Rhode Island Methodist churches are in the collections of \r\nthe Library of the Boston University Theological School (745 Commonwealth Ave, \r\nBoston, MA 02215). Church records for Cranston and Bristol are particularly \r\nwell-represented. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Moravian</strong></p>\r\n<p>&#8226; The records for the Moravian Church in Newport are in the Moravian Archives \r\n(41 West Locust St., Bethlehem, PA 18018).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Roman Catholic</strong></p>\r\n<p>&#8226; Some parishes will allow individuals to use their records, though most will \r\ndirect you to the Diocesan Archives (1 Cathedral Square, Providence, RI 02903). \r\n</p>\r\n<p>&#8226; There are registers for Irish parishes at the Chancery Archives of the \r\nArchdiocese of Boston (2121 Commonwealth Avenue, Brighton, MA 02135). </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Probate records</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Probate records concerning wills, adoptions and guardianships are filed on \r\nthe town level. Town councils acted as probate courts. Until 1818, the city of \r\nProvidence required an inventory of a deceased person&#8217;s belongings regardless of \r\nthe size of the estate. After 1818 inventories were prepared only when a person \r\ndied intestate. Volume 16 of the <em>Rhode Island Genealogical Register</em> is an \r\nindex to abstracts of probate records that have appeared in that journal. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Court records</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>The Rhode Island Supreme Court Judicial Records Center maintains records for \r\ncivil and criminal cases (1671&#8211;1900), divorces (1749&#8211;1900), and naturalization \r\npapers (1793&#8211;1974). The documents for Bristol, Kent, and Washington Counties are \r\nin poor condition and may not be available to researchers. Only the earliest \r\ncourt records have been transcribed and published. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Land and property records</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>RISA has all the charters and land grants for the colony as well as a card \r\nindex to land transactions from 1648 to 1776. Land transactions on the local \r\nlevel are located in town halls. A fire damaged or destroyed some of the record \r\nbooks for North Kingstown in the 1870s, but some have been reconstructed. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Military and benefits records</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Manuscript service records for the state guard, militia units, and other \r\nbranches of services up to the end of World War II exist at RISA. Print sources \r\nfor King George&#8217;s War (1740&#8211;1748), the French and Indian War (1755&#8211;1762), the \r\nAmerican Revolution and Civil War are available at various repositories. \r\nUnfortunately, no comprehensive list of individuals from Rhode Island who \r\nparticipated in the American Revolution exists. Researchers should also consult \r\nthe holdings of the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University, and the \r\nNational Archives for the American Revolution. RISA has enlistment papers, \r\nregimental descriptive books and compiled military records for the Civil War. \r\nRecords for the three Rhode Island militia units that served in the Spanish \r\nAmerican War are at RISA, as are the draft registrations for World War I and \r\ncasualty lists for World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Immigration and naturalization</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Passenger lists for the ports of Bristol, Warren, Providence, and Newport are \r\npart of the United States Custom House Papers, located at RIHS, while those for \r\nNewport are at the National Archives. Passenger lists for the Port of Providence \r\nin the twentieth century are available as a microfilm publication from the \r\nNational Archives and available to researchers at RIHS.[7]</p>\r\n<p>The Rhode Island Supreme Court Judicial Records Center is the central \r\nrepository for naturalization papers filed with state courts from 1793 to 1982, \r\nexcept for the records from 1894 to 1916, which are missing. The National \r\nArchives (Northeast Branch) has federal-level court records. These records \r\n(1791&#8211;1906 and some post 1916) were indexed by the WPA. The index is available \r\nat the Judicial Records Center and on microfilm from the National Archives. For \r\nrecords after 1906 contact the National Archives or the Immigration and \r\nNaturalization Service. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Newspapers</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Rhode Island has a fascinating newspaper history. The first paper in the \r\ncolony was the <em>Rhode Island Gazette</em>, published from 1732 to 1733. The \r\nlongest running newspaper is the <em>Providence Journal</em>, established in 1833 \r\nand still printed today. Under the auspices of the United States Newspaper \r\nProject, RIHS microfilmed all known Rhode Island newspapers including foreign \r\nlanguage papers. These reels are accessible at RIHS. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Genealogical manuscript collections</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Manuscripts relating to the history of the state and the genealogy of its \r\nfamilies can be found at RIHS, NHS, RISA, and the John Hay Library at Brown \r\nUniversity.[8] These include the DAR transcriptions of Bible, cemetery, death, \r\nmarriage, and probate records; the Sidney S. Rider Collection of correspondence, \r\nnewspaper clippings, church histories, and published materials on Rhode Island; \r\nthe Louise Prosser Bates collection of deed abstracts, land grants, probate \r\nrecords, genealogies, and town and cemetery records; and the Anthony Tarbox \r\nBriggs collection of transcripts of cemetery, family, and vital records, plus \r\nwills. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\r\n<p>1 Cutting Marsh, &#8220;Sketch of the Brothertown Indians,&#8221; <em>Wisconsin Historical \r\nCollections</em>, 4 (1857&#8211;58):291&#8211;98. </p>\r\n<p>2 Maureen A.

Descendants of early Rhode Island families \r\nhave a valuable resource available to them in <em>Records of the Colony and State \r\nof Rhode Island edited by John Russell Bartlett </em>on CD-ROM from the \r\nSociety.</p>\r\n<p>In the mid-nineteenth century Bartlett oversaw the review, transcription, and \r\nabstraction of thousands of documents from the state&#8217;s storied past. This effort \r\nwas undertaken at the behest of the legislature to ensure that significant \r\npapers from Rhode Island&#8217;s settlement in 1636 through about 1792 would be \r\npreserved for future generations. The end result was ten volumes and one \r\nsupplement. All eleven books are included on the CD-ROM. The information is from \r\na wide variety of sources, from freeman&#8217;s lists to pension files to acts of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the legislative body of Rhode Island.</p>\r\n<p>Those interested in joining a hereditary society, such as the National \r\nSociety of Colonial Dames in America, will find this work exceedingly valuable \r\nin identifying individuals whose service qualifies descendants for membership in \r\nsuch organizations. Officers of the colony and state, militiamen, Revolutionary \r\nWar soldiers, and others are often listed.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the records can provide insight into your ancestors&#8217; lives. Zorababel \r\nWestcot and Elisha Mitchell were two of five men convicted on April 22, 1700, in \r\nthe town of Kingstown for causing a riot. The five petitioned the General \r\nAssembly for a rehearing. Westcot admitted his guilt before the Assembly and \r\nbegged forgiveness for which actions his penalty was abated by twenty shillings \r\nand he was required to pay only that amount in penalty. Mitchell, on the other \r\nhand, refused to acknowledge the legality of the conviction, and maintained that \r\nin fact he had ridden out to rescue a legitimate prisoner of a deputy sheriff on \r\nthe same day as the trial. He was required to pay the entire penalty, plus the \r\nfees of the officer since his commitment, and he was to remain a prisoner until \r\nthe monies were paid.</p>\r\n<p>With the coming of the Revolutionary War, the Assembly required individuals \r\nto take an oath to test their allegiance. Subsequent sessions are filled with \r\nrecords of individuals who refused and were forcibly removed from their homes, \r\nsuch as Matthew Cozzens, Andrew Christy, and Dr. William Hunter.</p>\r\n<p>The fully-searchable format makes it easier to find heretofore hidden \r\ninformation. One must, however, beware the vagaries of colonial-era spelling \r\nwhich can make it more difficult to find information. The materials that \r\nBartlett preserved so long ago are finding new life and use helping all \r\ngenealogists with Rhode Island roots.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\r\n<p>1 <em>Records of the State and Colony of Rhode Island and Providence \r\nPlantations</em>,<em> </em>edited by John Russell Bartlett (CD-ROM, orig. pub. \r\nProvidence, RI: A.

Taylor", "country": "Rhode Island", "title": "A Picture Perfect Past: Finding Rhode Island Family Portraits", "content": "<p>Looking for ancestral portraits can be like looking for a needle in a \r\nhaystack. I would love to have a picture of everyone on my family tree from the \r\nadvent of photography in 1839 to the present, but apparently many of my \r\nancestors didn't seek out the services of a professional photographer. There \r\nwere undoubtedly other ancestors that could not afford a camera. That doesn't \r\nmean I have given up. If your relatives are like mine, it makes the search more \r\ndifficult, but don't assume you will not find anything. Several years ago, my \r\nfather suddenly appeared with a framed, oversized charcoal portrait of my great \r\ngrandfather that he rescued from a cousin. As with all types of family research \r\nyou never know what you are going to find until you start to look. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>There are several ways to discover those long lost visages. Contacting \r\nfamily, searching libraries (both online and traditional), digging through \r\nauctions and flea markets, and looking at family and photo reunion websites are \r\nall wonderful ways to discover those family photographs. Locating images is all \r\nabout learning how to use the tools at your disposal. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Family Collections</strong><br>The most likely place to uncover new family \r\nimages is in the collections of relatives. They may have albums of carefully \r\nlabeled photographs of weddings, family gatherings, and other events, or they \r\nmay just have piles of unidentified and identified images in boxes. The good \r\nnews is that some of the unidentified subjects in your collection might be \r\nidentified in their collection. </p>\r\n<p>It is important to set up appointments to go through private photographic \r\ncollections, so you have the time to carefully look at every photograph and \r\nhopefully make copies of some of them. Some individuals decide the best time to \r\nexchange photographs is by planning a family reunion. If you have lost track of \r\nfamily, you can use the Internet to locate distant cousins by posting queries on \r\nmessage boards requesting images of ancestors. There is usually no fee to use \r\nthese message boards. See my article on searching manuscript collections online \r\nin this website's \"Computer Genealogist\" column (also in summer 2002 issue of \r\n<em>New England Ancestors</em>) for advice on finding family photographs hidden in \r\nmanuscript materials. You might actually add other documents to your family \r\narchive in addition to photographs. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Libraries<br></strong>There are two types of libraries-the traditional bricks \r\nand mortar variety and the electronic libraries found on the Internet. Many \r\nlibraries have now digitized their holdings for their websites, enabling you to \r\nsearch collections from home. I am unaware of any Rhode Island-based libraries \r\nwith digitized picture collections online as yet, but there could very well be \r\nplans in the works for such a project. Remember to search traditional libraries \r\nfor biographical encyclopedias and family histories, as these may contain \r\nengravings. For instance, the <em>Biographical Cyclopedia of Rhode Island</em> \r\ncontains beautiful steel engravings of notable citizens along with information. \r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Traditional Libraries</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rihs.org/\" target=\"new\">Rhode Island Historical Society \r\n</a><br>121 Hope St.<br>Providence, RI <br>02906<br>(401) 331-8575 </p>\r\n<p>The largest collection of images in the state can be found in the Graphics \r\nDepartment of this library. Beautifully organized and well cared for, the \r\ncollection is open to the public, but only by appointment due to a lack of \r\nseating space. The knowledgeable staff will bring material to you from vertical \r\nfiles arranged by subject, location, or surname. Separate family collections \r\ncalled \"lots\" and group portraits are also available. If you ancestor belonged \r\nto a particular organization, let the staff know so you can make the most of \r\nyour limited time. General research is done by looking through files of \r\nphotocopies, rather than original images to decrease the wear and tear on the \r\nphotographs.

Expand your search for photographs to include \r\nprints, paintings, and even descriptive documents and you'll increase your \r\nsuccess. So go back and reexamine your genealogical documents and see if you can \r\nfind a physical description of your ancestor and then use your imagination. Your \r\nmind won't be able to show you exactly how they looked like in an actual \r\nphotograph, but you'll get the general idea. </p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/finding-rhode-island-family-portraits/", "published": "June 14, 2002", "id": 380}, {"author": "Maureen A.

Unless you have a \r\nspecific inquiry in mind, there is no one resource that will help you identify \r\nthe right group to contact for your request.

If you look at a gazetteer of the state, you will be \r\nstruck by the fact that though there are only 39 cities and towns, there are \r\nmany more public and private libraries that maintain collections of local \r\nhistory and genealogy.

Since their collections focus on the \r\nhistory of a town or village, it is possible to find a variety of unique \r\nmanuscript and visual materials. These kinds of items are generally not included \r\nin online catalogs, so your first step should be to ask a reference librarian \r\nfor assistance. Be advised that librarians are only able to answer questions \r\nthat pertain to their collections--please do not contact them with genealogical \r\nrequests. Rules for using special materials vary, but most research repositories \r\nask that you use pencils when taking notes, ask for permission before \r\nphotocopying any local history materials, and bring change with you for \r\nphotocopying.

Taylor", "country": "Rhode Island", "title": "Across the Border: Rhode Islanders and Pancho Villa", "content": "<p>Immediately prior to World War I, a short-lived conflict called The \r\nMexican Punitive Expedition of 1916-1917 occupied national attention. \r\nLost in the shadow of the \"Great War,\" the conflict has disappeared from\r\n most Rhode Island record books even though the Rhode Island National \r\nGuard was called in to national service to assist. </p>\r\n<p>In January 1916, Francisco &#8220;Pancho&#8221; Villa, a bandit who opposed the \r\nMexican president, killed nineteen American rail passengers in Mexico. \r\nThen in March, he and approximately 500 followers attacked the small New\r\n Mexican community of Columbus. In this skirmish, at least fifteen \r\nAmerican soldiers died, as did a few Mexican troops.&#160; This was just one \r\nof the many border conflicts in which Villa and his men participated. </p>\r\n<p>Following the attack on Columbus, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson \r\ndirected Brigadier General John J. &#8220;Black Jack&#8221; Pershing to command \r\n14,000 Army troops. Additionally 140,000 members of the army and \r\nNational Guard protected the border between the United States and \r\nMexico. Rhode Island members of the Light Battery A, Rhode Island Field \r\nArtillery, participated in this conflict. </p>\r\n<p>The goal of the campaign was to capture Villa, but this never \r\nhappened. He and his followers proved impossible to detain despite being\r\n greatly outnumbered. The &#8220;Punitive&#8221; Expedition failed to fulfill its \r\nmission, but Woodrow Wilson campaigned for re-election with the slogan, \r\n&#8220;He Kept Us Out of War,&#8221; meaning a war with Mexico, not the war looming \r\nin Europe. </p>\r\n<p>Despite its small size and scope, a wide range of materials exists on\r\n the military operation, both on the state and federal level. It is \r\nunknown how many Rhode Islanders served in the army during the \r\nexpedition. You can determine if your ancestor participated in the \r\nMexican Border conflict by first requesting service records that list \r\nunits they served with. The second step is to research general accounts \r\nof the expedition to see if the unit took part in the military \r\noperations. </p>\r\n<p>An historical overview of the Punitive Expedition appears in a \r\ntwo-part article by Mitchell Yockelson, &#8220;The United States Armed Forces \r\nand the Mexican Punitive Expedition.&#8221; This is found on the National \r\nArchives website (<a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/fall_1997_mexican_punitive_expedition_1.html\">part\r\n 1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/winter_1997_mexican_punitive_expedition_2.html\">part\r\n 2</a> )&#160; and in print in <em>Prologue</em> Vol. 29, nos. 3 and 4, (Fall \r\nand Winter 1997).

According to the project&#8217;s website, &#8220;The United States Newspaper \r\nProgram is a cooperative national effort among the states and the federal \r\ngovernment to locate, catalog, and preserve on microfilm newspapers published in \r\nthe United States from the eighteenth century to the present.\" Genealogists can \r\nnow locate, view, and in many cases, borrow on microfilm (contingent on library \r\npolicies) any newspaper originally published in Rhode Island or any of the other \r\nparticipating states and territories. A full list appears on the project&#8217;s \r\nwebsite.&#160; An essential part of the USNP was identifying a library or archive in \r\neach state that would act as the major repository for those microfilms. In Rhode \r\nIsland, that is the <a href=\"http://www.rihs.org/\" target=\"new\">Rhode Island \r\nHistorical Society Library </a>(121 Hope Street, Providence, RI 02906). </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>The initial phase identified the newspapers and located them in libraries and \r\narchives around the country so that they could later be microfilmed. At the end \r\nof the grant, there were 1,699 titles cataloged, which breaks down to 450,000 \r\npages microfilmed. While the microfilms are stored and accessible at the Rhode \r\nIsland Historical Society Library, that doesn&#8217;t mean you have to live in Rhode \r\nIsland to know what exists. With technical assistance provided by the Library of \r\nCongress, all the newspaper titles were cataloged into OCLC, a database that \r\nmany public libraries and archives use. </p>\r\n<p>Each catalog record contains the name of the paper, any name changes, \r\nfrequency of publication, political stance (such as Democrat or Republican) and \r\nwho owns the originals and microfilms of those papers. This means that \r\ngenealogists have greater access to newspapers than ever before. Clarence S. \r\nBrigham&#8217;s two volume <em>History and Bibliography of American Newspapers \r\n1690-1820</em> (American Antiquarian Society, 1947) provides users with a short \r\nhistory of newspapers for each state and a list of who owned what as of 1947. It \r\nis a wonderful resource for papers published before 1820, but genealogists \r\nwishing to access material after that year had to contact various libraries and \r\narchives to find a copy of a particular paper. Now, with the OCLC database \r\navailable at many public libraries, a reference librarian can usually find what \r\nyou are looking for within minutes if you have the name of the paper. The RIHS \r\nkeeps a notebook that contains a subject index to the cataloged newspapers, \r\nwhich includes everything from abolition to different ethnic groups (both \r\nEnglish and foreign language papers). </p>\r\n<p><strong>History</strong></p>\r\n<p>Rhode Island has a fascinating history of newspaper publishing. The first \r\npaper in the colony was the <em>Rhode Island Gazette</em>, published from \r\n1732-1733. The longest running newspaper is the <em>Providence Journal</em>, \r\nestablished in 1833 and still being printed today.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The early papers consisted of only four pages (a single sheet folded in \r\nhalf). There were two women who figured prominently in Colonial Rhode Island \r\nnewspapers, Ann Franklin and Sarah Goddard. Franklin became the publisher of the \r\n<em>Newport Mercury</em> in 1762, when her son James died. She continued for about \r\na year until she herself died in 1763.&#160; This paper ceased publication during the \r\nFrench occupation of Newport in 1776 and didn&#8217;t resume until 1780. Goddard took \r\nover publishing her son William&#8217;s paper, <em>The Providence Gazette</em>, when he \r\ndecided to move from the city. She remained publisher until 1768. </p>\r\n<p>The first foreign language paper in the United States was the <em>Gazette \r\nFrancois</em>, printed in Newport from 1780-1781. Most new ethnic groups that \r\nmoved into Rhode Island began publishing a foreign language paper for their \r\ncommunity. Italians, Germans, and French-Canadians each published a combination \r\nof news from home and on local citizens. </p>\r\n<p>According to James L. Hansen&#8217;s &#8220;Research in Newspapers&#8221; chapter in <em>The \r\nSource</em> (Ancestry, 1997), &#8220;three nineteenth-century developments changed the \r\nnewspaper dramatically: the invention of the power printing press, the \r\ndevelopment of the railroads (which allowed much wider distribution of a paper), \r\nand the increasing demand for news, especially during the Civil War.&#8221; While \r\nindividuals published the newspapers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, \r\nthe twentieth century was the age of the conglomerates, which bought up many \r\nsmall, locally produced papers. Today, with most papers online, it is easier \r\nthan ever to look at yesterday&#8217;s news. And with many of these newspaper websites \r\nincluding online archives of older issues, it is possible to go back even \r\nfurther in time. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Using the newspaper </strong></p>\r\n<p>Newspapers can be utilized for genealogical research in a variety of ways. \r\nThe majority of researchers try to find birth, marriage, and death notices, but \r\nthis is only possible with a specific date. Additionally, newspapers only \r\npublished vital record notices for prominent individuals prior to the late \r\nnineteenth/early twentieth century. Regardless, it is worth searching the papers \r\nfor advertisements for businesses or local history events that can enliven your \r\nfamily history.&#160; Here are things to look for when seeking news on relatives in \r\nnewspapers: </p>\r\n<p><strong>Obituaries:</strong> Search for several days after the death and in all \r\navailable papers for an area. A death notice was usually only published if a \r\nfamily member wrote and submitted it, or if the individual was prominent in the \r\ncommunity. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Marriages:</strong> These may include short announcements, anniversary notices, \r\nor full accounts. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Birth:</strong> When birth announcements appeared, the notice was brief and \r\noften incomplete. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Local News:</strong> The coverage ranged from political events to school news, \r\nand the publisher determined the extent of news covered in a particular \r\nnewspaper. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Biographical Information:</strong> News items would often profile prominent \r\ncitizens, business leaders, and even ordinary individuals involved in something \r\nnewsworthy. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Shipping News:</strong> The lists of maritime arrivals and departures can help \r\nyou ascertain the ship on which your ancestor immigrated. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Advertisements (announcements):</strong> Public and private announcements often \r\nappeared in newspapers, especially those published prior to 1800. They would \r\nreport thefts, runaway wives, military deserters, and missing slaves and \r\nservants. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Advertisements (business):</strong> Your ancestor may have received advertising \r\nspace for his or her business, which could provide an address or other \r\ninteresting information. </p>\r\n<p>There are several ways to access the information in Rhode Island newspapers \r\nusing special indexes and online sources. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Indexes</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Rhode Island Collection at the Providence Public Library (225 Washington \r\nSt., Providence, RI, 02903) keeps an index to major events and prominent \r\nindividuals featured in the Providence Journal from c. 1900 to the present.<br></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ancestry.com/\" target=\"new\"><em>Ancestry.com </em></a>is \r\ndigitizing newspapers for their Historical Newspaper Collection database, \r\nincluding several from Rhode Island.

Taylor", "country": "Rhode Island", "title": "Eighteenth Century Divorce in Rhode Island", "content": "<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p>Rhode Island had one of the highest frequencies of divorce in the \r\nAmerican colonies throughout the eighteenth century.[1] Prior to 1747, \r\nadultery was the only reason officially recognized by the General \r\nAssembly or Court of Trials for seeking a separation or divorce. After \r\n1747, divorce petitions were examined at the quarterly sessions of the \r\nSuperior Court of Judicature. While marital separation existed in Rhode \r\nIsland since the mid-seventeenth century, grounds for divorce remained \r\nlimited until 1798. In that year the law code for divorce was expanded \r\nto include &#8220;impotency, extreme cruelty, and gross misbehavior and \r\nwickedness in either of the parties repugnant to and in violation of the\r\n marriage covenant.&#8221;[2] </p>\r\n<p>There are several reasons genealogists should consider looking for \r\ndivorce documents. Each divorce record contains evidence of the marriage\r\n and provides an interesting look at your ancestors. All petitions for \r\ndivorce, including unsuccessful ones, are located at the Judicial \r\nRecords Center (5 Hill St., Pawtucket, RI 02860). For more information \r\non obtaining access to these materials or for a list of their holdings \r\nsee their <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.courts.state.ri.us/records/defaultrecords.htm\">website</a>. The records for Providence County are \r\navailable and indexed. Check with the Judicial Records Center for access\r\n to the records for other counties. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Types of Divorce</strong></p>\r\n<p>Two types of actions could be granted to a divorce petitioner in \r\neighteenth century Rhode Island: <em>a mensa et thoro</em>, which acted as\r\n a legal separation, and <em>a vinculo matri</em>, a formal divorce.&#160; The \r\nact of legally separating from a spouse generally provided &#8220;bed and \r\nboard&#8221; support for the woman, but did not usually make allowances for \r\nremarriage. Augustus Babcock&#8217;s advertisement in the July 26, 1790 issue \r\nof the <em>Newport Mercury</em> stated that he would not honor his wife&#8217;s \r\ndebts or &#8220;pay for her Board or maintenance, nor for the Board, Support \r\nand Maintenance, of my said Children.&#8221; Joseph Pain sought a separation \r\nfrom his wife Ruth and published notice in the <em>Providence Gazette</em>\r\n on September 24, 1796, that he would support her at the house of either\r\n Benoni Pain or Enos Mowry. By publishing such a notice he was publicly \r\nannouncing a bed and board separation, which supports a theory that \r\nnewspaper advertisements were a form of legal separation in lieu of the \r\nunwieldy legislative divorce proceedings.&#160; Ruth Pain eventually divorced\r\n Joseph after two petitions when neighbors supported her in a \r\ndeposition. </p>\r\n<p>While colonial newspapers published many such notices, the more \r\ncommon practice in Rhode Island was to seek a divorce <em>a vinculai \r\nmatrimonium</em>, which would allow either partner to remarry.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Contents of Divorce Petitions</strong></p>\r\n<p>Divorce cases began with the petitioner&#8217;s statement, which expressed \r\nthe petitioner&#8217;s desire to fulfill the bond of marriage and placed blame\r\n for its failure on the spouse. This formula was the same regardless of \r\nwhether the petitioner was male or female.&#160; Eunice Smith called \r\n&#8220;Marriage a perpetual Fountain of Domesteick Sweets&#8221; and declared that \r\nshe had fully expected to carry out the responsibilities of her marriage\r\n vows when she married.[3] &#160; </p>\r\n<p>Divorce petitions also included such information as the date and \r\nplace of marriage, and when the couple settled in a particular town, as \r\nwell as the reasons for seeking the divorce. In cases where the \r\npetitioner sued for divorce because of bigamy, the petition can give \r\nvaluable proof of the first and the additional marriage. Joseph Gray \r\nmarried Lucy Bancroft in Smithfield in 1772, then abandoned her and \r\nmarried again in Reading, Massachusetts, in 1780. Her divorce petition \r\nincluded a copy of the second marriage notice. By the end of the \r\ncentury, divorce cases also included a register of goods to be used for \r\nalimony. Phyllis Brazier gave the judge an inventory and asked for an \r\niron pot and kettle.[4] &#160; Suzannah Richards&#8217; inventory listed furniture,\r\n spinning wheels, basic household necessities such as plates and \r\nutensils, and a gun that belonged to her first husband.[5] &#160; The final \r\nelement of a divorce case was the collection of depositions from friends\r\n and relatives. </p>\r\n<p>Occasionally wives or husbands were asked to testify in the divorce \r\nproceedings. John Whipple accused his wife Hannah of having given birth \r\nto a bastard; the Justices of the Peace of Johnston summoned her to \r\nanswer the charge. During the examination she admitted that the child \r\nwas conceived through adulterous relations with John Stravens in 1763, \r\nduring the time she was boarding with or working for John Fenner. \r\nInterestingly, when asked &#8220;How long ago is it since you see your husband\r\n last?&#8221; she stated that &#8220;it is better than three years.&#8221; [6] There is no\r\n information on where John Whipple had been during those years.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Other Grounds for Divorce</strong></p>\r\n<p>Cases of spousal abuse appeared in divorce petitions and in newspaper\r\n advertisements. Deborah Baker left her husband of twenty-one years \r\nbecause he threatened to kill her. [7] Men also left abusive \r\nrelationships. Andrew Stone claimed that his wife Mary frequently beat \r\nhim.[8] &#160; </p>\r\n<p>Many men and women filed for divorce on grounds of adultery and named\r\n the guilty party. Prudence Austin claimed she was left with two \r\nchildren to support while her husband Gideon committed adultery with \r\nMary Webb.[9] Richard Borden stated in his petition that his wife &#8220;hath \r\nmost notoriously at many times quitted and absconded from his bed and \r\nboard, and accompanied abroad with other, particularly in a criminal, \r\ncarnal and adulterous manner with one Fisher Fiske.&#8221;[10] </p>\r\n<p><strong>Desertion</strong></p>\r\n<p>The divorce petitions and newspaper notices indicated that desertion \r\nwas relatively common, but it was difficult to verify the whereabouts of\r\n the missing spouses. Historian Nancy Cott suggested in her article \r\n&#8220;Divorce and the Changing Status of Women,&#8221; that desertion was itself a \r\nform of self-divorce, the &#8220;poor-man&#8217;s self divorce.&#8221;[11] While deserting\r\n men generally left town (New York was a popular destination), most \r\nwomen remained in the local area. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Children</strong></p>\r\n<p>Divorce petitions generally focused on the relationship between \r\nhusband and wife, but they sometimes offered examples of what happened \r\nto the children.&#160; Robert Potter&#8217;s wife Sarah moved away with her \r\nfather&#8217;s family leaving her child behind.[12] Marcy Brown deserted her \r\neight children, including one infant, to join the Shakers.[13]&#160; &#160;Thomas \r\nEddy&#8217;s wife Ann eloped with all of his belongings and his children.[14] </p>\r\n<p>Divorce cases often offer the only tangible evidence of births, \r\nmarriages, and re-settlements. In bigamy cases there may be a second \r\nfamily to research and the clues exist in the form of a signed slip of \r\npaper by the minister who performed the second or first marriage. \r\nDepositions state family relationships and help researchers develop a \r\nsense of the kinship networks that existed in Rhode Island&#8217;s small towns\r\n and villages. Family members were often called upon to be witnesses. \r\nOccasionally the courts sought a deposition from a relative who lived in\r\n another area or state thus giving genealogists a new place to search \r\nfor records. </p>\r\n<p>These petitions are a way to learn about your ancestors&#8217; lives from \r\ntheir own words. The vast majority of these individuals left no other \r\nwritten record behind. Unfortunately, court documents are overlooked and\r\n underutilized because they are not always indexed.

The advertisements included the name of the deserter, a physical \r\ndescription, place of belonging, unit they served with, and the name of the \r\nofficer who placed the notice. For instance, Reuben Ballou placed several \r\nadvertisements for men that deserted his unit. Original copies of the newspapers \r\nare available at the Rhode Island Historical Society and on microfilm at various \r\nacademic and research libraries. The notices from the Providence Gazette have \r\nbeen published in myRunaways, Deserters and Notorious Villains (Picton, \r\n1994).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pension Papers</strong><br>Lists of pensioners from 1820, 1835, and 1840 appear \r\nin vol. 12 of Arnold's Vital Records of Rhode Island, 1636-1850. The published \r\n1820 list includes the name of the soldier, rank, service and date of death. The \r\n1835 list includes the name, rank, annual allowance, sum total of what was \r\nreceived, description of service, when placed on the pension roll, the date the \r\npension commenced, age at the time of commencement, laws under which they were \r\nplaced on the rolls, remarks and date of death. The 1840 list is shorter and \r\nincludes just name, age and place of residence.

While these examinations can \r\nbe difficult to locate, they can prove military service. Their value is clearly \r\nillustrated by Mark Noble 's examination. It lists where he was born and \r\noutlines his life history and military service. According to his testimony, he \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\"...enlisted into the Army of the United States and served as one of the \r\nHadley quota part of the time in Col.

Taylor", "country": "Rhode Island", "title": "Finding Scoundrels in Rhode Island", "content": "<p>Everyone has at least one in his or her family tree - a \r\nscoundrel. The very word conjures up a scruffy appearance, shifty eyes, and \r\nvillainous deeds. Yet, the definition of a scoundrel varies between families.&#160; \r\nGenerally anyone who exhibits behavior outside the norm can be regarded as one. \r\nMost people usually associate the condition with men, but just as many family \r\ntrees have colorful women. In fact, the word &#8220;scoundrel&#8221; refers to someone with \r\nunknown origins or one who is known as a disreputable person. When searching for \r\nthe skeletons in your family closet, remember to keep your impressions in \r\nhistorical context. A misdeed in the seventeenth century may not be considered \r\none in the nineteenth century. \r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>Rhode Island had a reputation of being home to all sorts of unsavory \r\ncharacters, from religious dissenters in Colonial times to rumrunners during \r\nprohibition. Your chances of finding those &#8220;interesting&#8221; characters in your \r\nfamily increase when you search records outside of the normal areas, as shown \r\nbelow. Try to think like your ancestor and follow good genealogical research \r\ntechniques to discover the hidden history in your family tree.</p>\r\n<p>Methodology comes first. It makes sense to create a list of records that the \r\nindividual may have created or left behind in his or her lifetime, and then try \r\nto find them. If you think about life patterns, places lived, activities and \r\nevents of the time, and family members, you might be able to discover more than \r\nyou think. If you are researching a hard-to-find individual that lived within \r\nthe last century, start by talking with relatives. Generally, family members \r\npass on tales of exploit and remain silent on scandal, but you never know what \r\nkernels your relatives might want to share.</p>\r\n<p>Begin by checking all the usual places, such as vital, census, and military \r\nrecords. Unfortunately, you may not find complete documentation for poor, \r\ntransient, or troubled individuals. Civil registration commenced in 1853, but \r\nrecords before that are notoriously incomplete, especially for rural areas. \r\nCensus reports after 1850 contain lists of residents of orphanages, prisons, and \r\ninsane asylums. In the late nineteenth century, the Rhode Island State \r\nLegislature printed rosters of students that attended schools for the deaf and \r\nblind in their annual reports. Newspapers regularly published notices of \r\ncriminal activity, desertion, runaways, and personal notices. The two volumes of \r\nmy <em><a href=\"http://www.pictonpress.com/store/show/899\" target=\"_blank\">Runaways, Deserters, and Notorious Villains from Rhode Island \r\nNewspapers</a></em> (Picton Press, 1994, 2001) contain those announcements that \r\nwere published in Rhode Island in the eighteenth century. City directories, \r\nusually thought of as being all-inclusive, in fact fail to include the homeless, \r\nthe poor, and anyone in an institution. However, directories are great resources \r\nfor locating orphanages, prisons, and names of institutions, which may lead you \r\nto new record sources. Anyone in a special circumstance will not appear in tax \r\nrecords either. So where can you look? There are plenty of places!</p>\r\n<p>Here is an overview of seven different types of records, why you should \r\nconsult them, and where you can find them. Two good resources for earlier \r\nrecords are Ann Smith Lainhart&#8217;s <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Digging-Genealogical-Treasure-England-Records/dp/0880820535\" target=\"_blank\">Digging for Genealogical Treasure in New England Town \r\nRecords</a></em> (NEHGS, 1996) and Laura Szucs Pfeiffer&#8217;s <em>Hidden Sources: \r\nFamily History in Unlikely Places</em> (Ancestry, 2000). For twentieth-century \r\nrecords, use Kathleen W. Hinckley&#8217;s <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Locating-Lost-Family-Members-Friends/dp/1558705031\" target=\"_blank\">Locating Lost Family Members &amp; Friends</a></em> (Betterway, \r\n2000). </p>\r\n<p><strong>Adoption/Guardianship Cases<br></strong>Prior to the twentieth century, \r\nadoptions were primarily informal affairs. However, you can find adoptions \r\nrecorded in guardianship papers, which are contained in probate records at the \r\ntown level. For instance, the Billings children appear in the probate records \r\nfor the city of Providence. Not only do the records indicate the reason for the \r\nremoval of the children from their natural family (neglect), but also who took \r\nthem (The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Children). By using census \r\nrecords one can piece together their lives. As it turns out, the Billings \r\nchildren were never adopted and they spent their childhood in state care.</p>\r\n<p>The State Legislature also sanctioned adoptions.&#160; From 1800 to 1880, the \r\nquarterly reports of the General Assembly listed the names of adoptive parents \r\nand birth names of the children. Once you have that information, uncover the \r\nbackground by using vital records and census reports.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Apprenticeship Contracts<br></strong>These materials are difficult to locate \r\neven when you know the name of the person and with whom they were apprenticed. \r\nStart with manuscript collections for the family or town by searching the card \r\ncatalog at the <a href=\"http://www.rihs.org/\" target=\"_new\">Rhode Island \r\nHistorical Society</a> or at NEHGS. An apprenticeship document usually contains \r\nthe name, age, place of birth, and term of service of the apprentice.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Court Documents<br></strong>Civil and criminal court cases kept by the <a href=\"http://www.judicial-records.state.ri.us/\" target=\"_new\">Rhode Island Supreme \r\nCourt Judicial Records Center</a> can be a gold mine for researchers. Their \r\narchives contain civil and criminal court cases (1671-1900), divorce cases \r\n(1749-1900), and some naturalization papers (1793-1974). Online order forms are \r\navailable on their website for specific requests, but for general information \r\nabout the archives&#8217; holdings, send an <a href=\"mailto:archives@judicial-records.state.ri.us\">email request</a> to them. \r\nAll court cases after 1900 must be requested via regular mail. See their website \r\nfor further details. </p>\r\n<p>Since Rhode Island had a reputation as the most litigious colony, there is a \r\ngood chance you&#8217;ll find information on those unsavory ancestors in court \r\ndocuments.&#160; Civil or criminal court cases and divorce proceedings consisted of \r\npetitions and depositions with lots of details. You&#8217;ll be surprised how much the \r\nneighbors knew about family disputes in the eighteenth century. Indexes are by \r\nthe name of the petitioner or criminal, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t find \r\nyour ancestor. Try searching the indexes by surname for collateral relatives and \r\nyou might uncover testimony given by your direct descendant. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Manumissions<br></strong>Was your ancestor involved in the slave trade? Rhode \r\nIsland figured prominently in the Triangle Trade of slaves, rum, and sugar. Jay \r\nCoughtry&#8217;s <em>Notorious Triangle</em> (Temple University Press, 1981) divulges \r\nall the details. A small but wonderful collection of manumission papers exists \r\nin the Quaker records for the city of Newport. My personal favorite is the slave \r\nwho first bought his own freedom, then negotiated for the release of his mother. \r\nNames, dates, and terms of the manumission make for interesting reading. \r\nUnfortunately, there is no surname index for this group of material. While \r\ncolonial census records included a column for slaves, the next step is finding \r\nout their identity in state documents and family papers. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Photographs<br></strong>Don&#8217;t overlook your photographs for clues to those \r\nnotorious family members. In existence in Rhode Island since 1840, photographs \r\noffer hints to the time period in which they were taken. Look closely at the \r\nclothing, the props used, and the photographer&#8217;s imprint. That small pin in the \r\nlapel of your grandfather&#8217;s suit coat may link him to a membership organization, \r\nor the style of his clothing may tell you more about his occupation. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Poor Records<br></strong>In colonial New England, towns had a responsibility to \r\ncare for their indigent population. That means you might find them mentioned by \r\nname in town records. When formal workhouses and poor farms became the norm in \r\nthe mid-nineteenth century, records for these institutions started being kept. \r\nThe Dexter Asylum served as the primary poorhouse in the city of Providence for \r\nover a hundred years. The manuscript division of the Rhode Island Historical \r\nSociety currently houses the records of the Dexter Asylum. These records list \r\nthe names of inmates, their ages, and how long they stayed at the asylum, among \r\nother things. Sometimes you will find whole families under town or state care. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>If you know your family lived in Rhode Island, but you cannot find them in \r\ntax records, city directories, or any other records, check the poor farm \r\ndocuments. Since the towns themselves paid for the care of the poor, they were \r\ncareful to make sure that they only assisted their own citizens. Anyone moving \r\nto a new town in the colonial period had to prove they had means to financially \r\nsupport themselves; if they could not, they underwent a transient examination, \r\nin which they would have to disclose information about their last legal \r\nresidence to the town&#8217;s council or selectmen. The town officials might then \r\nelect to order the newcomer(s) out of town, which was known as a &#8220;warning out.&#8221; \r\nThe purpose of warning out transients was to protect the town and reduce the \r\nhomeless and vagrancy rate. In some areas, warning out records list the names of \r\nall family members, while other areas list only the head of the household and \r\nhis or her children. Many, however, list the previous residence of the family or \r\nindividual, which is perhaps the most valuable information contained in warning \r\nout records.Ruth Wallis Herndon studies Rhode Island&#8217;s transient population in \r\nher new book, <em>Unwelcome Americans: Living on the Margin in Early New \r\nEngland</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001) </p>\r\n<p><strong>Prison<br></strong>Prison records are related to court documents and usually \r\nlist the name of the incarcerated, their place of birth, age, crime, and length \r\nof sentence. Bear in mind that persecution of certain ethnic groups sporadically \r\noccurred, which is why prison ledgers show large numbers of Irish or Italians \r\nduring certain time periods for offences as minor as drunkenness to serious \r\ncrimes like murder. These records can be found in various locations, such as \r\nState Archives or at the prison itself. The manuscript department at the Rhode \r\nIsland Historical Society Library has a large collection of prison records. </p>\r\n<p>If you do find a &#8220;scoundrel&#8221; on your tree, it is important to understand why \r\nhe or she was regarded as one. Consider when and where they lived, their \r\noccupation, why they disappeared from public record, when that happened, and the \r\nhistorical events that may have shaped their behavior. It is vitally important \r\nto understand your relatives in the historical context in which they lived \r\nrather than using contemporary standards to judge them. Don&#8217;t forget to use \r\nInternet resources to assist in your search. Enlist the help of other relatives \r\nthrough online message boards and search online databases for the information \r\nyou seek. You never know where you&#8217;ll find clues.

I recently rediscovered my great-grandfather&#8217;s \r\naccount book for the family house painting business, which contains \r\nlists of the people he worked for as well as their payments and debts. \r\nSurprisingly, some of the names were familiar to me. He worked for \r\nfriends and neighbors and his record keeping provides me with a sense of\r\n where he worked as well as new clues to investigate. \r\n<p>The great news for Rhode Island genealogists is that \r\nthe Rhode Island Historical Society has been collecting business records\r\n since their founding in 1822. Their manuscripts curator, Richard \r\nStattler, has compiled a list of the companies represented in their \r\ncollections, arranged by topic and with dates of coverage. There is an \r\namazing breadth and depth to the collection, which represents everything\r\n from individual artisans to the records of multinational corporations \r\nbased in the state. The manuscripts date from the early eighteenth \r\ncentury through the twentieth century. His inventory does not include \r\nindividual account books or apprenticeship documents mixed in with \r\npersonal papers also found in the collections. Whether your ancestor was\r\n business owner, an employee, or a customer, this extensive collection \r\nof material may be of value to you. </p>\r\n<p>Additional\r\n business records can be located using the National Union Catalog of \r\nManuscript Collections (NUMUC) that can be searched <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.loc.gov/coll/nucmc/nucmc.html\">online</a>.&#160;\r\n Each entry includes a brief description of the collection and where it \r\nis located. You can then write to that institution to learn about the \r\nfull scope of the material and their usage policies. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Books</strong></p>\r\n<p>Peter Coleman&#8217;s <em>Transformation\r\n of Rhode Island, 1790-1860</em> (Brown University, 1963) provides an \r\noverview of Rhode Island&#8217;s participation in the Industrial Revolution. \r\nIf your ancestors worked in manufacturing, consult the <em>Biographical \r\nHistory of the Manufacturers and Business Men of Rhode Island at the \r\nOpening of the Twentieth Century </em>(J.D. Hall, 1901) for a history of \r\nlarger companies and profiles of their owners. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Directories</strong></p>\r\n<p>City directories include a person&#8217;s occupation and\r\n sometimes the name of their employer. Directories are also a great way \r\nto trace the growth of a company or its demise. Before deciding that the\r\n business your ancestors worked for is defunct, try to find out through \r\ndirectories and incorporation papers (see below) whether the business \r\nwas acquired or merged into another company. </p>\r\n<p>Business\r\n directories listed the names and locations of businesses within their \r\narea of coverage. Providence city directories began publishing business \r\nlistings in the back as early as 1847, arranged by business or \r\nprofession.&#160; Separate business directories for Providence and Rhode \r\nIsland began publication in 1872. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Employment\r\n records</strong></p>\r\n<p>Some modern business records \r\ninclude a list of employees and what they were paid. In some cases, \r\nthere is additional information. At the Rhode Island Historical Society,\r\n the majority of records related to business and employment are kept in \r\nbusiness collections within their manuscripts department. I recently \r\nasked RIHS manuscripts curator Richard Stattler about the types of \r\ninformation found in employment records in their collection. He replied,\r\n &#8220; First of all, not all of the business collections at the Rhode Island\r\n Historical Society have employment records.&#160; Finding them would involve\r\n reading through each of the respective finding aids.&#160; Employment \r\nrecords generally are limited to payroll &#8212; who was paid, and how much.&#160; \r\nIn unusual cases, RIHS might have applications or pension records giving\r\n more data.&#160; Individual production records can sometimes be found for \r\nworkers paid for piecework.&#160; Some of the modern records have seniority \r\nlists, showing date of hire.&#160; Some early mill records occasionally list \r\nworkers by family, demonstrating a relationship, because they were hired\r\n as&#160;a group.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Journals and Newspapers</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>The Providence Magazine and Board of Trade \r\nJournal </em>(1889<em> &#8211;</em>1934) was a monthly journal published by \r\nProvidence Chamber of Commerce that reported on happenings in the \r\nbusiness community. The Rhode Island Historical Society Library and the \r\nProvidence Public Library have complete runs of this publication, and \r\nRIHS keeps a partial index to it. Don&#8217;t forget to look for company \r\nperiodicals and magazines. For instance, during World War II, the Kaiser\r\n Shipyard in Providence published <em>The Yardarm</em> that included a \r\nprofile in each issue on one of the women employed there. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Legislative Charters and Incorporation Papers. </strong></p>\r\n<p>From the 1700s to 1900, businesses frequently \r\napplied for charter from the Rhode Island General Assembly. These \r\ncharters are indexed by subject and business name at the Rhode Island \r\nState Library (State House, Room 208,&#160;Providence, Rhode Island,&#160;02903, \r\n401-222-2473). The index references the citation for the charter that \r\nappears in the Acts and Resolves of the General Assembly. The staff of \r\nthe State Library accepts phone and mail requests for information. The \r\nwebsite of the State of Rhode Island features a <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.corps.state.ri.us/\">database</a>of \r\nbusinesses that applied for incorporation papers from 1984 to the \r\npresent. A card index organized by business name for the colonial period\r\n through 1983 is located at the Corporations Division building (100 \r\nNorth Main St., Providence, Rhode Island, 02903 401-222-3040). They \r\naccept mail inquiries and up to three questions via phone. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Manufacturing Census</strong></p>\r\n<p>Individuals\r\n who owned their own businesses were categorized in a special decennial \r\ncensus taken in the same year as the federal population census. Consult \r\nMeyer H. Fishbein&#8217;s <em>The Censuses of Manufactures, 1810-1890</em>, <em>Reference\r\n Information Paper 50</em> (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and \r\nRecords Service, 1973); and Kathleen Hinckley&#8217;s <em>Your Guide to the \r\nFederal Census for Genealogists, Researchers, and Family Historians</em> \r\n(Betterway, 2001). Rhode Island industry and manufacturing censuses \r\nexist for the years 1810, 1820, and 1850 through 1860. Since \r\nphotographers were considered manufacturers in 1850, they appear in the \r\nmanufacturing census. No business was too small for inclusion. Each \r\nlisting contained the name of the owner, location, number of employees, \r\nand additional information varying by census.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Unions</strong></p>\r\n<p>Through the efforts of the Rhode Island Labor \r\nHistory Society, the Rhode Island Historical Society has been collecting\r\n union papers for the last twenty years. \"A Guide to the Historical \r\nStudy of R.I. Working People,\" by Scott Molloy, et al (RILHS, 1996), \r\nfeatures a description of this particular collection.&#160;Richard Stattler \r\nnoted that most of the union records included dues and membership books,\r\n but that it varies on a case-by-case basis. &#160; </p>\r\n<p>With\r\n so many resources to choose from there is no reason not to research \r\nyour ancestors&#8217; working lives.

The exhibition catalog, <em>Buildings on Paper: </em><em>Rhode\r\n Island</em><em> Architectural Drawings, 1825-1945</em> by William Jordy \r\nand Christopher Monkhouse (1982), presented historical data on many \r\ndomestic, industrial and commercial buildings. </p>\r\n<p>While it is difficult to locate drawings of ordinary houses unless \r\nthey are passed down from owner to owner, drawings of Rhode Island \r\nhouses and buildings can be found in the collections of the contributors\r\n of the exhibition found in the front matter of the catalog. One of the \r\nmost extensive collections [c. 1750-1960] of these house drawings is \r\nfound at the Rhode Island Historical Society Library; it primarily \r\nfocuses on work by prominent architects. According to the collection \r\ndescription on the RIHS website, the material spotlights &#8220;renowned Rhode\r\n Island architectural firms and architects like Albert Harkness; Stone, \r\nCarpenter and Wilson; Monhan and Meikle; Thomas A. Tefft; Russell \r\nWarren; Bowerman Brothers; and William Warner, among others.&#8221; There are \r\nalso files created by architectural historians Isham and Cady. It&#8217;s \r\nworth searching the index to the collection if you have reason to \r\nbelieve a house was designed by a prominent architect or firm. </p>\r\n<p>Spending time researching the homes your ancestors owned or lived in \r\nis not a waste of time. Discovering that your great-grandfather&#8217;s family\r\n lived in the same neighborhood where your great-grandmother grew up \r\ncould verify the persistent oral-history account that he married the \r\n\"girl next door.\" It&#8217;s also possible that your ancestor built the house \r\nin which he lived and passed it down to his children, creating an \r\nunbroken chain of ownership for several generations.

You have never heard of Biscuit \r\nCity and you are unsuccessful finding any information on the place. \r\nCongratulations, you have just discovered one of the reasons \r\ngenealogical research in Rhode Island is so challenging. Although Rhode \r\nIsland has only 37 cities and towns with geographical and political \r\ndivisions, it has more than one hundred villages, many of which native \r\nRhode Islanders still identify with. For instance, when you ask a \r\nresident of Glocester where they are from they may say Chepachet (a \r\nvillage). Many of these villages and post offices no longer exist except\r\n in public records, family documents, and oral histories. So what can a \r\nresearcher do to find where an ancestor lived? A good map or gazetteer \r\nwill certainly help, and there are plenty of them available to Rhode \r\nIsland researchers.</p>\r\n<div id=\"paging\"><div> <p>Seventeenth and even eighteenth-century maps \r\nconsisted of plat maps, boundary lines, or military campaign maps. One \r\nearly map of Providence shows a rough outline of houses drawn by Brown \r\nUniversity student John Fitch in 1790. Another early Providence map is \r\nknown as the Powder Horn map, so called because it was drawn on one. \r\nBoth of these items are in the collections of the Rhode Island \r\nHistorical Society. Like most maps prior to 1800 they are hand drawn \r\nrather than printed. While interesting to look at, there is little \r\ninformation contained in the maps. A few houses and a street in the \r\nFitch map make it identifiable as Providence, but for the genealogist \r\nthese two examples are not very useful. </p>\r\n <p>According to David Cobb \r\nin his essay \"Windows to Our Past: Mapping in the Nineteenth Century\" (<em>Mapping\r\n Boston</em>, Muriel G. and Norman Levanthal Foundation, 1999), the \r\nAmerican map-making industry began in the mid-1800s when a growing \r\nmiddle class created a demand for printed maps in major cities such as \r\nBoston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. During this time, \r\nnew county and state maps were printed, including many genealogically \r\nimportant maps of nineteenth century Rhode Island. These maps are \r\ngenerally several feet in length and width and either varnished or \r\nattached to a wooden rod for hanging. Some of these oversize maps also \r\nfeature a list of businesses and prominent citizens. <br><br>One of the \r\nearliest state maps useful for genealogists is James Stevens' <em>A \r\nTopographical Map of the State of RI and Providence Plantations</em> \r\n(1831). On this map, small dots appear to represent houses along the \r\nmajor roads, but there are no names alongside the dots. For the Civil \r\nWar period consult Henry F. Walling's <em>Map of the State of Rhode \r\nIsland and Providence Plantations</em> (1862). Walling began his career \r\nin Rhode Island, and became one of the nineteenth century's most \r\nproductive cartographers. His maps reveal names of the occupants of \r\nhouses that Stevens represented as unnamed dots on his earlier map. \r\nCongested areas are shaded, but if your ancestor lived in a rural area \r\nyou might be able to find out approximately where their house stood. \r\nThis map includes insets of larger villages such as Slatersville \r\n(Smithfield) and Greenville (Gloucester) along with a business \r\ndirectory. There is a Rand McNally &amp; Company map of Rhode Island (<em>Atlas\r\n of the World</em>, 1895) showing many small villages that is viewable <a href=\"http://fermi.jhuapl.edu/states/ri_0.html\" target=\"_new\">online</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Atlases</strong><br>Late in the nineteenth century, atlases became \r\npopular because they were able to accommodate larger and more detailed \r\nmaps. In addition to maps, these volumes often contain local history, \r\nbusiness directories, and even lithographic portraits of prominent \r\ncitizens. They frequently show property ownership. Another type of atlas\r\n developed and used by the Sanborn Insurance Company assessed the fire \r\nrisk of urban areas. They generally just included the center city and \r\nsurrounding residential blocks of towns and cities with a population of \r\nover 2,000. The information gathered about building composition (shown \r\nin color coding) and function is valuable to present-day genealogistsand\r\n environmental engineers. Sanborn maps from 1867 to 1970 can now be \r\nviewed <a href=\"http://sanborn.umi.com/\" target=\"_new\">online</a> by \r\nsubscription. Environmental Data Resources, Inc.

Thankfully, there is an abundance of information \r\navailable on the various denominations that settled in Rhode Island. A wide \r\nvariety of religious groups gravitated to Rhode Island because the colony was \r\nconsidered tolerant. In the seventeenth century Roger Williams brought his group \r\nof followers to Providence to escape the repressive climate of the Massachusetts \r\nBay Colony. He founded the First Baptist Church in America there in 1638. Soon \r\nafter, various dissenting sects began migrating to the state, including the \r\nSociety of Friends (Quakers), French Huguenots, and Jews. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>Researchers can discover what records exist by consulting both reference \r\nworks for the state and sources that focus on one particular parish or \r\ndenomination.&#160; <em>A Guide to the Church Vital Statistics in the State of Rhode \r\nIsland</em>, produced during the Works Progress Administration&#8217;s Historical \r\nRecords Survey, listed the church records available as of 1941.

If you are unable to locate the records for a \r\ndefunct parish, try contacting these societies to see if the missing records \r\nmight be in their collections. RIHS has miscellaneous records for Protestant \r\nchurches throughout the state while NHS keeps a comprehensive collection of \r\nrecords for Newport's churches of all denominations. If you are looking for a \r\nparticular denomination, here is an outline of what is available in print and in \r\nmanuscript form. <br><br><strong>Anglican<br></strong>Both Trinity Church in Newport and \r\nSt. Paul's Church in Narragansett established congregations by the late \r\nseventeenth century. Original church records for Trinity Church are at NHS. \r\nWilkins Updike included the parish register for St. Paul's from 1718 to 1774, as \r\nwell as some genealogical data, in his <em>History of the Episcopal Church in \r\nNarragansett, Rhode Island</em>&#160; (New York : H.

These records are \r\nkept in the manuscripts department of the Rhode Island Historical Society \r\nLibrary, but researchers must first write to the historian at the First Baptist \r\nChurch (75 North Main St., Providence, RI 02903) for permission to view them. \r\n<br><br>The <a href=\"http://www.abc-usa.org/abhs/\" target=\"new\">American Baptist \r\nHistorical Society </a>(1106 S.

If you are looking for a particular parish, \r\ntry contacting them for a copy or consult another WPA publication, <em>Inventory \r\nof Church Archives in Rhode Island: Baptist Bodies </em>(Providence: Historical \r\nRecords Survey, 1939), also available on microfilm through the <a href=\"http://www.familysearch.org/\" target=\"new\">Family History Library </a>. \r\n<p>Other notable sources for Rhode Island Baptist churches are: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Records for the Six Principle Baptist Church in North Kingstown, Rhode \r\nIsland, are kept in the manuscripts department of RIHS.&#160; <br></li>\r\n<li>John Comer, a Baptist minister, kept a diary of the people he met while \r\nserving in Little Compton and Tiverton from 1774 to 1800 that includes some \r\ngenealogical data.

At one point in the mid-eighteenth century, \r\nalmost fifty percent of the state's population was Quaker. The New England \r\nYearly Meeting records from 1654 to the present are on deposit at the Rhode \r\nIsland Historical Society Library, which published Richard D. Stattler&#8217;s \r\n<em>Guide to the Records of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in New \r\nEngland</em> (Providence: RIHS, 1997). These records contain meeting minutes, \r\nvital statistics of members, their testimonies (beliefs and convictions), \r\nmembership lists, sufferings (penalties Quakers suffered for following \r\ntestimonies), denials, memorials, slave manumissions, financial transactions, \r\nand more. The New England Yearly Meeting of Friends covers all of Rhode Island, \r\nmost of Massachusetts (except Nantucket), and parts of Connecticut, Maine, and \r\nNew Hampshire.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>A number of early Rhode Island Quaker families migrated to New Jersey, so \r\nWilliam Wade Hinshaw&#8217;s <em>An Encyclopedia of American Quaker Genealogy</em> (six \r\nvolumes, 1936-1950; reprint, Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, \r\n1969-1973) on Quakers in the Mid-Atlantic States should also be consulted. A \r\ngood resource for families in the South Kingstown area is <em>Nailer Tom's \r\nDiary</em> (Boston: Privately published, 1930), the diary of Thomas Benjamin \r\nHazard, which refers to births, marriages, and deaths from 1778 to 1840. While \r\nthe book lacks an index, a typescript index is at \r\nRIHS.<br><br><strong>Huguenot<br></strong>The French Huguenots were Protestants who fled \r\npersecution for their beliefs. In the seventeenth century a French Huguenot \r\nsettlement was located in East Greenwich, but it was short-lived. Many of the \r\nemigrants left the area, and those that stayed anglicized their names. The \r\nrecords of their church were translated and printed in an article by Effingham \r\nde Forest titled, \"Records of the French Church at Narragansett, 1686-1691\" \r\n(<em>New York Genealogical and Biographical Record </em>70 [1939] 236-241, \r\n359-365; 71 [1940] 51-61).<br><br><strong>Jews<br></strong>The first Jewish synagogue in \r\nAmerica was founded in Newport in 1680 and built with contributions from Jews \r\nthroughout the colonies. The papers of Aaron Lopez, one of the first Jews in \r\nRhode Island, are at the NHS. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Methodist<br></strong>Some records for Rhode Island Methodist churches are in \r\nthe collections of the library of the Boston University Theological School (745 \r\nCommonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215). A list of their holdings appears on their \r\n<a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/sth/library/\" target=\"new\">website</a>). Church records \r\ninclude: State Street Methodist Episcopal Church (Bristol), several parishes in \r\nNewport, and the Print Works Mission (Cranston). Unfortunately, the collections \r\nfor the African Methodist Episcopal churches owned by the <a href=\"http://www.providenceri.com/RI_BlackHeritage/\" target=\"new\">Rhode Island \r\nBlack Heritage Society </a>are currently in storage and unavailable for \r\nviewing.&#160;&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Moravian<br></strong>The records for the Moravian Church in Newport are in the \r\n<a href=\"http://www.moravianchurcharchives.org/\" target=\"new\">Moravian Archives \r\n</a>(41 West Locust St., Bethlehem, PA 18018). The Moravians are a Christian \r\nsect established in 1457.<br><br><strong>Roman Catholic<br></strong>Some parishes will \r\nallow individuals to use their records, though most will direct you to the <a href=\"http://www.rcab.org/archives/welcome.htm\" target=\"new\">Diocesan Archives \r\n</a>(1 Cathedral Square, Providence, RI 02903). Irish parish registers may be \r\nviewed at the Chancery Archives of the Archdiocese of Boston (2121 Commonwealth \r\nAvenue, Brighton, MA 02135).&#160; Father Robert Hayman's history of the Catholic \r\nChurch in Rhode Island, <em>Catholicism in Rhode Island and the Diocese of \r\nProvidence</em> (Providence: Diocese of Providence, 1982) provides a good general \r\noverview. The <a href=\"http://www.afgs.org/\" target=\"new\">American French \r\nGenealogical Society </a>(78 Earle St., Woonsocket, RI 02895) transcribed and \r\npublished parish records for Rhode Island churches.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to regularly search the Internet for new transcriptions, \r\npublications, digitized publications, and databases. For instance the <a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.com/~rigenweb\" target=\"new\">Rhode Island GenWeb site \r\n</a>has several items of interest to researchers looking for religious records. \r\nAmong them are a membership list of the Sabbatarian Church (Seventh Day Baptist) \r\nof Newport from 1671 to 1830 and Memorials of Deceased Friends (Quakers) of New \r\nEngland Yearly Meeting.

Investigate manuscript collections of \r\nsocieties and libraries in the family&#8217;s area.

Greene \r\nand Virginia D. Harrington identify several informal &#8220;censuses&#8221; taken during the \r\ncolonial period. The information in this volume, combined with other sources, \r\ncan help you locate your ancestor in colonial Rhode Island. Unfortunately, the \r\nmajority of aggregate data mentioned in Greene and Harrington provide only \r\nnumbers, not names. There are no official &#8220;census&#8221; records that list the names \r\nof the individuals being counted in the seventeenth century. The original \r\nrecords are no longer in existence. However, several seventeenth-century \r\npopulation lists actually contain data useful for genealogical research.

Full citations are provided in Greene and Harrington&#8217;s work for \r\nsuch sources as the colony records found at the State Archives and Public \r\nRecords Administration. For instance, 258 freemen were counted in the 1655 \r\ncitation from the above towns, but no names were recorded. From that statistic \r\nit is difficult to estimate how many women and children were living in the area. \r\nSince there is no specific information about individuals, the genealogical uses \r\nfor this data are limited.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>To verify if your ancestor was actually in Rhode Island during the \r\nseventeenth century you&#8217;ll have to rely on manuscript collections, land records, \r\ntown documents, and whatever vital records were kept.

Basically, the United States wanted the right \r\nto trade with all nations, even during wartime. Specifically, they wanted to \r\ncontinue trade with France during the French Revolutionary Wars, which began in \r\n1792. President Thomas Jefferson hoped to assert our right to trade by passing a \r\nseries of Embargo Acts stopping foreign trade. These actions adversely affected \r\nthe livelihood of Rhode Island&#8217;s shipping industry.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>In 1808, Great Britain began forcibly seizing sailors thought to be British \r\ndeserters from American ships, and claiming them as their own. This practice, \r\nknown as &#8220;impressment,&#8221; continued until 1811, and more than six thousand sailors \r\nin all were taken from American vessels.<br><br>As a result of this practice and \r\ntrade issues, the Jeffersonian Party headed by James Madison declared war on \r\nEngland in June of 1812.&#160; However, Rhode Islanders, and the rest of New England, \r\ncried foul. They objected to the conflict, calling it &#8220;Mr. Madison&#8217;s War.&#8221; \r\nProvidence citizens even declared a day of mourning &#8212; shops were closed and \r\nstate flags were at half-mast.[1] </p>\r\n<p>The Rhode Island General Assembly initially refused to allow the state \r\nmilitia to serve on the national level.

This is \r\nprobably due to the fact that many researchers aren&#8217;t aware of the wealth of \r\ncensus documents that exist on the state or city level. </p>\r\n<p><strong>State Census<br></strong><br>Rhode Island state \r\ncensuses were taken at ten-year intervals between 1865 and 1935, although the \r\n1895 returns are missing. The Rhode Island State Archives (337 Westminster St., \r\nProvidence, RI 02903) has microfilm copies of all the state material mentioned \r\nhere. If you need additional information about their holdings, contact archivist \r\nKen Carlson at (401) 222-2353. The Rhode Island Historical Society has \r\nmicrofilms of the 1865, 1875, and 1885 censuses. </p>\r\n<p>State censuses, like those on the federal level, were taken \r\nat ten-year intervals. The first Rhode Island state census was taken in 1865 and \r\nthe last in 1935. The census of 1895 is missing. Some of these censuses contain \r\nonly basic information (name, birthplace, occupation, etc) and others are more \r\ndetailed. I have listed the characteristics of each of the Rhode Island state \r\ncensuses below. </p>\r\n<p><strong>1865: <br></strong>An every name index makes this census easy \r\nto use.&#160; It includes: &#8220;name of every person, (man, woman or child), whose usual \r\nplace of abode was in the family on the first day of June, 1865,&#8221; including \r\nthose absent due to service in the Army or Navy.&#160; Also listed is the person&#8217;s \r\nage, occupation, birthplace (name of Rhode Island town or if elsewhere just the \r\nstate), and whether he or she was a naturalized voter.&#160; No relationship is \r\nmentioned for the members of a household. If you are trying to verify military \r\nservice, this is the census to consult. One of the columns identifies the branch \r\nof the service the individual served in (Army or Navy) or the branch in which \r\nthey were currently enlisted.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>1875:</strong> <br>Several years ago, a dedicated genealogist \r\nnamed Al Eastwood indexed this census. While Eastwood is no longer with us, his \r\nlegacy lives on in the card index he created, which currently resides at the \r\nRhode Island State Archives. The basic information appears in this census such \r\nas name, age, and occupation. This time the relationship between the members of \r\na household was recorded. </p>\r\n<p><strong>1885:</strong> <br>Patience is needed to use this census. It is \r\narranged loosely by town, males and females are separated, and nothing is \r\nindexed. All the males who share the first letter of a surname are grouped \r\ntogether, followed by all the females according to town. Each family is \r\ndesignated a number so it is possible to recreate households by that number. The \r\nnumber of individuals living in the household is beside the family number. While \r\nthe family number helps you recreate the household, it can be difficult to find \r\na member of the household that had a different surname without scanning the \r\nwhole roll.&#160; Al Eastwood indexed Bristol County, but died before completing the \r\nrest.&#160; The index is at the Rhode Island State Archives. This census contains the \r\nsame categories as the 1875 census, but includes more data on voter status &#8212; \r\nreal estate, personal, or registered. </p>\r\n<p><strong>1895:</strong> missing </p>\r\n<p><strong>1905:<br></strong>The enumerators used cards instead of books \r\nto record the data for the most informative of the Rhode Island state censuses. \r\nFemales were asked a few additional questions pertaining to children. </p>\r\n<p>Male cards contain:&#160; name, residence (street and number), \r\ntown, county, voting district, ward, relation to head of family, color or race, \r\nage, date of birth (sometimes including month, day, and year), place of birth, \r\nnative or foreign born, conjugal condition, year of immigration to the U.S., \r\nnumber of years in U.S., number of years resident in Rhode Island, number of \r\nmonths resident during census year in town (or city) in which now living, place \r\nof birth of father, place of birth of mother, naturalization, voter (real \r\nestate, personal, or registered), able to read/write, occupation (thirteen years \r\nold and up), months unemployed during year, whether a Union soldier, sailor, or \r\nmarine during the Civil or Spanish American wars (state which war), if they \r\nreceive a pension, and religion (Roman Catholic, Protestant, or Jew). If \r\nProtestant, identify denomination. </p>\r\n<p>Female cards differ by asking if the individual was a mother, \r\nand if so, how many children and how many were still living; and whether she was \r\nthe widow of a Union soldier, sailor, or Marine during the Civil or Spanish \r\nAmerican War, and if she received a pension. </p>\r\n<p><strong>1915:</strong> <br>Arranged by town, but there is no index.&#160; \r\nThere are finding aids at the Rhode Island State Archives to assist researchers \r\nwith using this census.&#160; It contains name, address, relationship to head of \r\nfamily, personal description (sex, color or race, age at last birthday), \r\nnativity (of person and parents), citizenship, and occupation. </p>\r\n<p><strong>1925:</strong><br>Only the basic data was recorded for this \r\ncensus &#8212; name, birthplace, occupation, citizenship, and the relationship between \r\nmembers of the household.&#160; While there is no index, the Rhode Island State \r\nArchives has a finding aid available. </p>\r\n<p><strong>1935:</strong> <br>&#160;All information for this census was \r\nrecorded on punch cards and arranged by town. Sometimes the specific birth date \r\nand place is mentioned.&#160; Rather than just listing occupation, the enumerators \r\nalso wrote down the name of the employer. See my earlier article on finding \r\nemployment records for assistance in locating additional information based on \r\nthat clue. The name of the school was recorded for students.&#160; If you want to \r\nknow if your ancestor ever had the measles, this is just one of the many small \r\nfacts recorded in this census. </p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, Rhode Island didn&#8217;t continue with state \r\ncensuses after 1935. Legislation was introduced to the General Assembly in 1945 \r\nto produce a census, but it was never done. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Locality Specific Census </strong></p>\r\n<p>There are three known local enumerations for Providence \r\n&#8212;1791, 1825, and 1845 (only half of the second ward). All are available on \r\nmicrofilm at the Rhode Island Historical Society.&#160; For additional information on \r\nthe types of material in that repository consult their newly redesigned <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.%20rihs.org/\">website</a>, which contains a list of \r\nmanuscript finding aids as well as research help for genealogists. </p>\r\n<p><strong>1791: <br></strong>Taken in the year following the first \r\nfederal census, this local return was lost until Charles B. Allen found it in \r\nhis father&#8217;s papers and gave it to the <em>Providence Journal</em> in 1868. It was \r\nlater given to the Rhode Island Historical Society.&#160; According to the Society it \r\n&#8220;seems to be arranged in order of visitation, and is divided into north, south, \r\nand west parts of town. It lists the names of Heads of Families, and counts for \r\neach household of Number of Dwelling Houses, Free White Males over and under 16, \r\nFree White Females, All Other Free Persons, and Slaves.&#8221;&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>1825:</strong><br>Census taker Noah Smith, Jr. counted the \r\nheads of families by breaking the enumeration down into columns: white males and \r\nwhite females under 18, 18 to 45, 45 to 75, and over 75 as well as &#8220;coloured \r\nmales&#8221; and&#160; &#8220;coloured females&#8221; under 18, 18 to 50, and over 50. There is also \r\ninformation on the Friends Boarding School, Brown University, the Alms House, \r\nand the jail. </p>\r\n<p><strong>1845:</strong><br>Only a section of the east side of the city \r\nwas recorded in 1845. Once again it is just heads of families with counts for \r\neach category. Under male and female there is more specific data than earlier \r\ncensuses: under 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 15, 15 to 20, 20 to 30, 30 to 40, 40 to 50, 50 \r\nto 60, 70 to 80, 80to 90, 90 to 100 and over 100. The small age ranges means \r\nthat genealogists can use this information to add to what is known about their \r\nfamily. Persons of color were counted under different categories: under 10, 24to \r\n36, 36 to 55, 55&#160; to 100, and over 100. There is no category for the age range \r\n10 to 23. According to the Rhode Island Historical Society, this census also \r\ncounted the insane and students. In several instances, notes were added about \r\ncertain household&#8217;s ethnicity or location. A list of all individuals aged over \r\n70 appears in the volume.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>The following three censuses are only available in the \r\nManuscript Department at the Rhode Island Historical Society. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Persons Liable for Military Duty, 1873 </strong></p>\r\n<p>There are nineteen notebooks that list men eligible for \r\nmilitary service, their ages, and their addresses. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Military Census of Providence, 1881 </strong></p>\r\n<p>This list of men between the ages 18 and 45 is arranged by \r\nthe first letter of the surname in each ward. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Military Census of Providence, 1882 </strong></p>\r\n<p>Contains the same data as the Military Census of 1881. </p>\r\n<p>Anyone looking for information on relatives living in Rhode \r\nIsland or its capital city of Providence should visit the Rhode Island State \r\nArchives to examine the state census records or the Rhode Island Historical \r\nSociety for the Providence census. The additional material found in these \r\nrecords could add individuals to your family tree, confirm your ancestor moved \r\nin the years between censuses, or provide evidence of citizenship or military \r\nservice. </p>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/rhode-island-local-and-state-censuses/", "published": "September 26, 2003", "id": 394}, {"author": "", "country": "Rhode Island", "title": "Rhode Island Military Artifact Figures in Case of The Missing Burnside Sword", "content": "<p>An historically important military artifact once owned by former Rhode Island \r\ngovernor and Civil War General Ambrose Everett Bumside is back in the United \r\nStates after apparently reposing mysteriously in Europe for over 100 years.</p>\r\n<p>The artifact, a wooden, velvet-lined Tiffany &amp; Co., New York, Civil War \r\nperiod sword case bearing the general&#8217;s name and rank on a German silver \r\nidentification placque, was recently acquired by Beltrone &amp; Co. of Keswick, \r\nVirginia, a firm that specializes in the location, acquisition, and placement of \r\nhistorical American and foreign military artifacts.&#160; The case was recently \r\noffered for sale by a French militaria dealer located near Lyon, France.&#160; The \r\ndealer reportedly acquired the piece in a nearby &#8220;flea market.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>According to Art Beltrone, who operates the Keswick firm, Burnside was \r\npresented with a cased Tiffany sword of silver and gold by the Rhode Island \r\nlegislature in May, 1862, following the military commander&#8217;s successful \r\nexpedition in early 1862 to secure a base of operations on the coast of North \r\nCarolina.</p>\r\n<p>The action resulted in the capture of Roanoke Island with 2,600 prisoners and \r\n32 heavy guns.&#160; The towns of New Bern and Beaufort were also seized, as was the \r\npermanent fortress of Fort Macon.&#160; Besides receiving the sword, which cost a \r\nreported $800 in 1862, Burnside was commissioned a major general for his \r\nsuccessful operation.&#160; Beltrone believes the Bumside sword case originally \r\naccompanied the Tiffany-made presentation sword.</p>\r\n<p>The location of the sword remains a mystery to this day.&#160; A check with the \r\nRhode Island Archives did not reveal its location, and a Rhode Island Historical \r\nSociety assistant curator reported there was no Bumside presentation sword in \r\nthe society&#8217;s military collection, which includes two Burnside paintings, a \r\nsleeve from the general&#8217;s uniform, correspondence, papers and, various printed \r\nand minted memorabilia.

Births are indexed from 1636 to 1970, while marriage and deaths are \r\nindexed form 1636 to 1970. Copies of Edwin M. Snow and Charles V. Chapin, \r\n<em>Alphabetical Index of Birth Marriages and Deaths Recorded in Providence</em>, \r\n32 vols., can be found at the Providence City Archives, the Rhode Island \r\nHistorical Society and the Providence Public Library. Ken Carlson, of the Rhode \r\nIsland State Archives, is working on a database of birth information for more \r\nthan 25,000 individuals taken from municipal and state records. By comparing \r\ntown records and state data, he found inconsistencies, omissions, and additional \r\ndata that will appear in the database.

Most of the legislation appears to be a response to \r\nloopholes in the law. An abbreviated listing of statutes relating to vital \r\nrecords follows:<br><br><strong>Timeline of Vital Records Legislation \r\n1647-1930<sup>1</sup></strong> </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li><strong>1647</strong> The Colony passes the first law regarding marriage in response \r\nto the Horod Long court case, which discusses her co-habitation with George \r\nGardner. </li>\r\n<li><strong>1647</strong> A statute requires that marriage banns be published in two town \r\nmeetings prior to the event. </li>\r\n<li><strong>1655-56</strong> Marriage banns can be published either at town meeting or on \r\ntraining day. </li>\r\n<li><strong>1698</strong> Births, marriages, and burials are to be brought to the town \r\nclerk to be recorded no later than ten days after the event. Once a year the \r\ntown clerk is to give an account of these occurrences to the head magistrate of \r\nthe town or the chief justice of the peace. </li>\r\n<li><strong>1701</strong> The Act to Prevent Clandestine Marriages holds that &#8220;Intentions \r\nof marriage shall be posted in a public place for 14 days.

If the \r\nindividuals who plan to be married are from different towns, banns must be \r\npublished in both towns. Anyone who breaks this law (assistant, justice, warden, \r\nminister or elder) fined 100 pounds. Individuals fined 20 pounds or three months \r\nimprisonment. Marriages should be brought to the town clerk by the married \r\ncouple within one month. Parents should register births and deaths of children \r\nwithin 2 months. Town clerks are empowered to collect fines or sue within two \r\nyears of event. </li>\r\n<li><strong>1798</strong> Banns must be placed in a public place by an official for 15 \r\ndays prior to the marriage.

Town clerks \r\nwill enter the certificates of marriages, births and death or be fined $10 for \r\neach incident of neglect. Out-of-state marriage candidates must have a \r\ncertificate from their town that says that they can be married. Failure to do so \r\nresults in a fine of $50.00. Marriages must be registered within 60 days. </li>\r\n<li><strong>1850</strong> Trustees of school districts are to obtain an accurate account \r\nof all births, marriages, and deaths within their district and turned over to \r\nthe commissioner of public schools and to the town clerk to be recorded.

If you find yourself undecided about \r\nwhere to begin your search for family history in The Ocean State then go \r\ndirectly to the Providence Public Library (PPL).&#160; It&#8217;s an amazing place to visit \r\nfull of unique resources you won&#8217;t find elsewhere in the state or anywhere in \r\nthe world. </p>\r\n<p>The Providence Public Library opened its doors to the public on February 4, \r\n1878. Don&#8217;t let the name fool you. This institution is privately operated and \r\nfunded. It&#8217;s independent of city government and seeks financial support from \r\nmany sources. From its humble beginnings in the old Butler Exchange building&#160; in \r\nwhat is now known as Kennedy Plaza, the PPL still occupies a central spot in the \r\ndowntown area of Providence with several neighborhood branch libraries. </p>\r\n<p>I spoke with Betty Fitzgerald, a PPL Reference Librarian who also oversees \r\nthe Rhode Island Collection about what researchers can find in this library. \r\n</p>\r\n<p><span class=\"h3\">Rhode Island Index</span></p>\r\n<p>Anyone who loves old style card catalogs will fall in love at first sight \r\nwith the wall size Rhode Island index. PPL officially funded a special position \r\nin 1963 to index newspapers and books on Rhode Island topics. A quick glance at \r\none of the index drawers will convince you of the importance of this resource. \r\nYou can find references to articles in the Providence newspapers, historical \r\nbooks, maps and photographs all arranged topically. I&#8217;ve used it to find \r\nphotographers, learn more about the history of certain streets and to follow the \r\ndevelopment of the revitalization of downtown Providence known as the Capital \r\nCenter project. Indexing of these materials stopped in 2004. </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"h3\">Rhode Island Collection</span></p>\r\n<p>This is a researchers dream come true.

There are a few rules regarding \r\nusage. You can only see three items at a time and you must leave identification \r\nat the Reference desk. <br>Within this vast collection of state related material \r\nare three commonly used resources: <br><span class=\"h3\"><br><em>City \r\nDirectories</em></span><br>The Library has Providence City Directories from 1824 \r\nto the present. Twentieth century volumes are in print, the rest are on \r\nmicrofilm. There are a few directories for other cities as well. Patrons request \r\nfilms at the Reference desk.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><span class=\"h3\"><em>Daughters of the American Revolution Grave Registration \r\nBook</em></span><em><br></em>If you can&#8217;t get to Washington, D.

Patrons need identification to use the microfilm department. </p>\r\n<p>In addition to an extensive general reference department and material \r\ndirectly related to Rhode Island, the Special Collections department has some \r\nspecialized collections. Access is possible only when the Special Collections \r\nLibrarian is available during limited hours.

It&#8217;s the collection of two \r\nformer editors at the Providence Journal who according to Fitzgerald, &#8220;loved \r\neverything Irish.&#8221; You&#8217;ll find books, pamphlets and broadsides.

Nicholson, the son of the \r\nfounder of the world-renowned Nicholson File Company, formed an outstanding \r\ncollection of 750 manuscript logbooks describing 1,000 whaling voyages, as well \r\nas several thousand printed books on whaling.&#8221; It includes material on whalers \r\nfrom New Bedford, Fall River and Nantucket, Massachusetts.&#160; The original whaling \r\nlogs are closed to the public, but available on microfilm in the Library. If \r\nyou&#8217;re curious about how Nicholson built this internationally known collection \r\nread a selection from Stuart C. Sherman&#8217;s book about the collection,&#160; <em><a href=\"http://www.provlib.org/ri_image/Whaling%20Collection/Sites/pages/specialcollections/nicholsonwhaling/booktext.htm\" target=\"_blank\">The Voice of the Whale Man</a></em>. </p>\r\n<p>While all these materials are available to users in the library, if you live \r\nout of town the staff accepts short requests for research through the &#8220;Ask the \r\nLibrarian&#8221; option on the Providence Public Library <a href=\"http://www.provlib.org/\">http://www.provlib.org/</a> website menu.&#160; \r\nAccording to Fitzgerald over fifty-two percent of the questions received are \r\nRhode Island related. </p>\r\n<p>Rhode Island is rich in resources for individuals with roots in the state&#8217;s \r\nhistory regardless of when your family arrived. After contacting this major \r\nrepository you&#8217;ll be able to branch out to more specific facilities and local \r\nhistory collections in other public and private libraries in cities and towns \r\naround the state. </p>\r\n<p><em>Maureen Taylor is The Photo Detective.

This beautifully \r\nillustrated book, edited by two professors at the Department of Textiles, \r\nFashion Merchandising and Design at the University of Rhode Island, is a \r\nresource for anyone trying to understand their female ancestors.&#160; <em>Down by the \r\nOld Mill Stream</em> examines the history of Rhode Island&#8217;s textile industry and \r\nthe women (and a few men) that made quilts. You will find descriptions of the \r\nfabrics and designs as well as additional information on these ancestral \r\ntreasures.&#160; The book is in two parts: Part one discusses the historical and \r\nsocial context of quilting in Rhode Island while the latter half features an \r\nanalysis of thirty quilts. This publication is part of the Rhode Island Quilt \r\nDocumentation Project, a collaborative effort started in 1992 to research and \r\ndocument nearly 900 quilts in communities throughout Rhode Island. </p>\r\n<p>Even if you don&#8217;t own a family quilt, this book will inspire \r\nyou to learn more about quilting so that you can leave your own legacy to your \r\ndescendants.&#160; As a photo historian used to looking at black and white \r\nphotographs of nineteenth-century families, this book helps me visualize the \r\nfabrics worn by individuals in these images.

Luti compiled notes, made gravestone \r\nrubbings, and took photographs of stones engraved by a handful of carvers.&#160; \r\nStart with his &lt;link&gt; preface for an explanation of what is covered and \r\nwhy he dedicated so much time to sorting out these carvers. This book is richly \r\nillustrated with photographs, charts, and sample engravings to help the layman \r\nunderstand the subtle symbols that appear in eighteenth-century gravestone \r\ncarvings. Luti examines the John Stevens shop, a leading Newport maker of \r\ngravestones, defining and deciphering that family&#8217;s dynasty as well as looking \r\nat an imitator. </p>\r\n<p>There is so much to like about this book. The diagrams are \r\neasy to follow. An index contains a list of names of interest to genealogists. \r\nThree foldout charts at the back of the book list the carvings by individual and \r\nare broken down by stylistic elements. If you have ever walked through a \r\nhistoric cemetery and wondered about who made those stones, then this is a book \r\nfor you. Gravestone scholars, genealogists, and social historians can thank \r\nVincent Luti for uncovering so much new information and presenting it in this \r\nwonderful volume.

This latest edition \r\nfeatures a new preface by the author, who is Professor of History and Director \r\nof the Center for Historical Studies at the University of Maryland in College \r\nPark. </p>\r\n<p>Gerstle used the records of the Independent Textile Union of \r\nWoonsocket, Rhode Island, to explore the concept of &#8220;Americanism&#8221; between World \r\nWar I and the Cold War. There is plenty of information on late nineteenth and \r\nearly twentieth-century Woonsocket, particularly involving the large French \r\nCanadian community and the small number of Franco-Belgians in the area. \r\nAccording to Gerstle, these two groups &#8220;would significantly shape the city&#8217;s \r\neconomy, culture, and politics.&#8221; This is a must read for anyone with roots in \r\nthese two ethnic groups in northern Rhode Island. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Unwelcome Americans: Living on the Margin in Early New \r\nEngland (Early American Studies) <br></em></strong>by Ruth Wallis Herndon.

These transient and poor individuals would be cross-examined by town \r\ncouncils after they arrived in towns seeking shelter. They were then sent on \r\ntheir way, only to repeat the process in the next town. If your ancestors in \r\neighteenth-century Rhode Island are difficult to locate, you will want to follow \r\nHerndon&#8217;s methodology for finding individuals whose lives consisted of &#8220;living \r\non the margin.&#8221;&#160; This is a fascinating read. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Fiction</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>I, Roger Williams <br></em></strong>by Mary Lee Settle. W.W. \r\nNorton, 2001 </p>\r\n<p>I have to admit I wondered how an author could write a \r\ncritically acclaimed novel about the founder of Providence, but Mary Lee Settle \r\ndid it.&#160; Settle imaginatively wrote a fictional autobiography of Williams \r\nstarting with his life in England, moving on to his employment as a secretary to \r\nSir Edward Coke, his schooling at Cambridge, and his eventual immigration to New \r\nEngland. She uses milestones from his life to discuss the major historical \r\nevents of the period. In order to involve readers in the seventeenth-century \r\nexperience she wrote in the English appropriate for the time. <em>Booklist</em> \r\ncommented that readers &#8220;will want to find out more about the people and events \r\nthat Settle presents.&#8221; For genealogists with seventeenth-century Rhode Island \r\nancestors, this offers a break from scholarly research. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Especially for Children</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Finding Providence: The Story of Roger Williams</em></strong> \r\n(An I Can Read Chapter Book)<br>by Avi, James Watling (Illustrator), Harper \r\nTrophy </p>\r\n<p>Avi, a Rhode Island-based author, wrote this book for second \r\nand third grade students about the life of Roger Williams, starting with his \r\nexpulsion from Massachusetts Bay in 1635.

James should be recognized&#8212;and respected&#8212;by anyone \r\nstudying the history or genealogy of early Rhode Island. As the author of \r\n<em>Colonial Rhode Island: A History</em> (New York, Scribner, 1975), James wrote \r\nan interesting and readable reinterpretation of the colonial period that is on \r\nmy top ten list of books for Rhode Island. </p>\r\n<p><em>Colonial Metamorphoses</em> is one of two works by Sydney V. James \r\npublished after his death in 1993, both edited by former students and \r\noutstanding scholars in their own right. The first book, edited by Dwight \r\nBozeman, <em>John Clarke and His Legacies: Religion and Law in Colonial Rhode \r\nIsland, 1638-1750</em> (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999) explores John \r\nClarke&#8217;s contribution to Rhode Island history through his founding of the First \r\nBaptist Church in Newport. It was Clarke that secured the royal charter that \r\ngoverned the colony and state until 1842. While early Rhode Island history \r\nfocuses on the contributions of Roger Williams, this book suggests that Clarke \r\nwas also instrumental in the formation of the colony.</p>\r\n<p>In <em>Colonial Metamorphoses</em>, James meticulously details the \r\nestablishment and development of colonial Rhode Island up to the Revolutionary \r\nera and explains how the institutions that affected individual \r\nlives&#8212;governments, churches, businesses, courts, and land companies&#8212;were \r\norganized and improved upon. Editors Sheila L. Skemp, a professor of history at \r\nUniversity of Mississippi and Bruce C. Daniels, a professor of history at the \r\nUniversity of Winnipeg express in their preface that &#8220;Rhode Island may be the \r\nmost understudied of England&#8217;s mainland colonies. Its lack of clear form, its \r\nironies and contradictions, its spotty and disorganized record keeping have \r\ndiscouraged even the most intrepid historian.&#8221; That may be true, but Sydney V. \r\nJames was brave enough to tackle a difficult topic.

This book, published to coincide with the \r\n300<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the cemetery, creates a record of the burials in \r\nthe oldest part of cemetery (1700-1848<strong>)</strong>. By the time formal records \r\nstarted being kept in 1848, twenty-two acres of prior internments were \r\nunrecorded.&#160; The North Burial Ground now covers 110 acres. This volume updates \r\nand amends the 5,600 transcriptions done by Frank Williamson (1856-1879) that \r\nappear in Arnold&#8217;s <em>Vital Record of Rhode Island</em> and the 7,500 names \r\nrecorded by F.

The index, compiled by Edward Field, was originally published in \r\n1902 and titled <em>Index to the probate records of the Municipal court of the \r\ncity of Providence, Rhode Island. From 1646 to and including the year 1899</em> \r\n(Snow &amp; Farnham). It quickly became a vital tool for anyone looking for \r\nancestors with Providence connections, and is still one of the first reference \r\nvolumes researchers consult when checking for such data.&#160; The published index is \r\nthe result of efforts undertaken by the clerk of the Municipal Court in 1897 to \r\norganize all pre-1891 documents. Amazingly, this entire project only took three \r\nyears to complete, and by 1900, the cumulative index from 1646 to 1899 was \r\navailable for use. The online database contains almost 30,000 probate cases \r\nhandled over the course of two and a half centuries. It is fully searchable by \r\nname, case number, date, or type of probate. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>The easy-to-use search engine for the database provides genealogists and \r\nhistorians with a number of options. For instance, you can search by name&#8212;first, \r\nlast, or both. There is a soundex option when you are unsure of how to spell a \r\nname. A general search for all individuals named &#8220;Brown&#8221; provides the expected \r\nresults plus spelling variations such as &#8220;Browne.&#8221; If you know the case number \r\nbut not the name of the person it belongs to, you can search by the number \r\nalone.&#160; You can narrow your choices by selecting the year of the probate record \r\nor search for all cases in a particular time frame be it one year or a span of \r\ndates. </p>\r\n<p>My favorite search feature is by type of case. It is important to remember \r\nthat a probate document can contain more than just a will. There are \r\nadministrations, affidavits, apprentices, inventories, etc.&#160; There are a total \r\nof fifty-two options, from absentees to wills. For example, if you are searching \r\nfor an ancestor that might have been adopted you can search for such case types \r\nas adoption, dependent child, and guardianships. According to law, cases that \r\ninvolved children were administered by the probate courts in Rhode Island. </p>\r\n<p>You may also search for dependent children cared for by the Rhode Island \r\nSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the State Board of Control \r\nby performing a search by organization. The results include the name of the \r\nchild, the year their case entered the public record, and the relevant case \r\nnumber. Searching the records of Rhode Island Society for the Prevention of \r\nCruelty to Children can help you reconstruct family groups. Since the Society \r\nremoved children from unfortunate family situations, the date of the probate \r\nrecord for dependent children can be a first step in finding verification of \r\nfamily relationships and additional record sources. </p>\r\n<p>So, how do you use the information in the index to find the documents? Well, \r\nit is a three-step process. First, find the document number in the index. In the \r\ncase of Mary Rhodes, who died in 1728, the probate index provides a date for the \r\nadministration of her estate and a case number&#8212;A 320. Next, consult the docket \r\nindex or record index to see if it is just an administration or also contains a \r\nwill available. These are found at the Providence City Hall Archives (City Hall, \r\nProvidence, Rhode Island, 02903, [401] 421-7740), on microfilm at the <a href=\"http://www.rihs.org/\" target=\"new\">Rhode Island Historical Society </a>(121 \r\nHope St, Providence, Rhode Island, 02906, [401] 331-8575), and at the NEHGS \r\nResearch Library. <br><br>Arranged by case number, the microfilm identifies the \r\nvolume and page of the case type including administrations, wills, and \r\ninventories. Sometimes the database indicates what type of record will be found. \r\nAbijah Potter died at sea on November 6, 1795, and his will appears in the index \r\nas being filed in 1796. Until 1818, the city of Providence ordered an inventory \r\nof belongings for each probate, regardless of the size of the estate. Since both \r\nMary Rhodes and Abijah Potter died before 1818 there should be an inventory of \r\nproperty for each of them. After 1818, inventories were prepared only for \r\nindividuals who died intestate. The final step in the process is looking at the \r\nactual documents.&#160; The microfilm covering the years 1646&#8211;1870 can be viewed at \r\nthe Rhode Island Historical Society or at the NEHGS Research Library. Materials \r\ndated after 1870 are found at the Providence City Hall, including Providence \r\nprobate records from 1900 to the present.&#160; Out-of-state researchers unable to \r\nvisit Rhode Island must request copies from city or town clerks, the Rhode \r\nIsland Historical Society, or from the NEHGS Research Services department. </p>\r\n<p>As you utilize the database and the probate records you will need to become \r\nfamiliar with some terminology. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Intestate:</strong> A person dies without a will and settlements are according \r\nto law.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Guardianship:</strong> A guardian appointed by the court to manage the estate \r\nof children when their father dies or because someone is unable to care for \r\nhimself or herself. The remaining parent can be named a legal guardian. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Administration:</strong> The actions of an individual responsible for managing \r\nthe settlement of the estate. </p>\r\n<p>Understanding the historical context in which probate records were created is \r\nan important step. This can be done by researching the estate laws in existence \r\nat the time of death or creation of the document. In Rhode Island, the <a href=\"http://www.courts.state.ri.us/library/defaultlibrary.htm\" target=\"new\">Rhode \r\nIsland State Law Library </a>(Frank Licht Judicial Complex, 250 Benefit Street, \r\nProvidence, Rhode Island, 02903,&#160; [401] 222-3275) is a good place to start. If \r\nyou live outside of the area, you can find copies of state laws, as at law \r\nlibraries throughout the county. Most are open to the public. </p>\r\n<p>As you will discover, probate records are the gateway to other types of \r\nmaterial. These dockets can also include child custody decisions, manumissions, \r\nand name changes. In Arlene Eakle&#8217;s chapter on &#8220;Research in Court Records&#8221; in \r\n<em>The Source</em> (Ancestry, 1997), there is a checklist of the types of other \r\ndocuments handled by probate courts. They can verify a death date, establish \r\nfamily relationships, identify professions, and lead to other records. When used \r\nin conjunction with colonial records, Providence city directories (starting in \r\n1824), federal and state census records, and tax records, you can reconstruct \r\nthe daily lives of your ancestors. While it is generally assumed that the \r\nmajority of people left no probate documents, the law prior to 1818 ensured that \r\nthose individuals unlikely to leave wills would have an inventory. One woman \r\nowned only a few pots and the clothes she wore, but an inventory existed because \r\nshe died before 1818. </p>\r\n<p>Researchers looking for probate documents in other communities within Rhode \r\nIsland should visit the town halls or consult town records on microfilm at the \r\nRhode Island Historical Society and the NEHGS Library. The dates of probate \r\ndocuments on microfilm for the other cities and towns vary, so it is best to \r\nconsult the NEHGS online catalog for holdings, or the town clerk for the city or \r\ntown of interest. You can also find out if such records exist by checking volume \r\n16 of Nellie C. Beaman&#8217;s <em>Rhode Island Genealogical Register </em>(Princeton, \r\nMA: Rhode Island Families Association, 1992), also known as the &#8220;will index&#8221; for \r\nprobate records outside Providence, from 1636 through 1840. </p>\r\n<p>The &#8220;Index to Providence, Rhode Island Probate, 1646&#8211;1899&#8221; database is a \r\ngreat tool for anyone looking for individuals who died in Providence during that \r\ntime period. Follow the steps to reconnect to the original documents and you may \r\nuncover fascinating and revealing material about your ancestors that cannot be \r\nfound elsewhere. </p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/2colPB.aspx?pageid=17031", "published": "September 12, 2002", "id": 401}, {"author": "Maureen A.

Sterling's involvement in the \r\nproject stemmed from a simple personal quest: \"My earliest ancestors were in \r\nLittle Compton in 1742. They appeared in the church records, but not in any of \r\nthe town records. What I was looking for was gravestone records to see if I \r\ncould locate information on my earliest ancestors. I'd been looking for the \r\nparents of Joseph Starling for thirty years.\" </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>What he found was far more compelling. \"As I began looking, I started finding \r\ncemetery transcripts in every library and historical society, over one hundred \r\nin all. My original concept was to computerize the transcripts into a huge \r\ndatabase and the job would be done.\" Sounds like a simple project to someone \r\nwith computer experience, but Sterling soon discovered that not all of the \r\ncemeteries in the state had transcriptions. Only about 2,000 transcriptions \r\nexisted out of what is estimated to be 3,200 cemeteries. Additionally, those \r\ntranscriptions usually only listed a vague location such as a town name or an \r\nout of date description. To a detail-oriented person, it made sense to update \r\nboth the descriptions and locators so that the cemeteries could be easily found. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>After checking the transcripts against the gravestone inscriptions, it was \r\ndiscovered that the transcripts were only about ninety percent accurate. The \r\nmost accurate collections, such as James Arnold's <em>Vital Records of Rhode \r\nIsland</em>, were nearly one hundred percent accurate while others had only a \r\nfifty percent accuracy rate. One of the primary goals of the project was to \r\nimprove these percentages. Starling's team decided to break down their plan into \r\ntwo phases: The first phase involved entering all of the early transcript data \r\ninto the computer, while the second phase entailed going to the cemetery, \r\nchecking gravestones, and correcting any errors found. They also measured the \r\nheight and width of the stones and noted the material, condition, shape, status \r\n(up, down, or broken), carving, and legibility. When all of the cemeteries of a \r\ntown were recorded and checked, a new book was published. Eight books have been \r\npublished so far and are available through the NEHGS online bookstore. To date, \r\ndata on over 3000 cemeteries has been entered into the database and over 2000 \r\ncemeteries have been physically checked. </p>\r\n<p>Sterling developed a computer program for his Rhode Island project in 1990. \r\nIn 1995, he refined it for regional variations using suggestions from readers of \r\nhis regular column, \"Gravestones and Computers\" in the <em>Association of \r\nGravestone Studies</em> (AGS) <em>Quarterly</em>. The software now sold by them is \r\nknown as the AGS Computer Database, and is the AGS standard. He is aware of at \r\nleast 400 groups busily cataloging gravestones in the United States and in \r\nseveral foreign countries. The fact that they all use the same program with \r\nstandardized formats enables the seamless merging of these databases into a \r\nnationwide repository of cemetery information. See the AGS <a href=\"http://www.gravestonestudies.org/\" target=\"_new\">website</a>&#160;for more \r\ninformation. </p>\r\n<p>Sterling and his group of volunteers decided to concentrate only on \r\npre-twentieth century cemeteries for two reasons: After 1900, death certificates \r\nwere issued for nearly everyone in the United States, and secondly, while modern \r\ngravestones are made of durable granite that should be readable forever, the \r\nolder marble gravestones are fragile and susceptible to the elements. At the \r\npresent time, two to&#160;four percent of the older stones in Rhode Island are \r\nunreadable. They set out to save the older information before it is lost \r\nforever. Prior to civil registration of vital records in 1853, a cemetery \r\ninscription may be the only data you can find on that person. </p>\r\n<p>In addition to creating a valuable genealogical research tool, Sterling's \r\nresearch has given insight into the probability of an ancestor's grave getting a \r\ngravestone. The earliest records for the North Burial Ground in Providence are \r\ndated 1848 to1850 and document one thousand interments. Twenty-five percent of \r\nthese have gravestones. Of the total count of internments, one third were \r\nadults, of which fifty percent are marked; another third are children, of which \r\ntwenty-five percent are marked; and the last third are unmarked burials in the \r\nFree Ground. If your ancestor died prior to the American Revolution, the \r\nprobability of their having a gravestone drops to a mere five percent. </p>\r\n<p>Librarian, genealogist, and author Deby Jecoy Nunes has worked on the Rhode \r\nIsland cemetery project from the beginning. She has been instrumental in placing \r\ncopies of the database in libraries throughout the state. Currently, the <a href=\"http://www.rihs.org/\" target=\"_new\">Rhode Island Historical Society </a>(121 \r\nHope St., Providence, RI, 02906) has the most up-to-date version of the \r\ndatabase, which features a flashing red \"P\" to indicate stones with poor \r\nlegibility. Nunes's Rhode Island Cemetery Database <a href=\"http://members.tripod.com/~debyns/cemetery.html\" target=\"_new\">website</a>contains a \" <a href=\"http://members.tripod.com/~debyns/tips.html\" target=\"_new\">Tips for Using \r\nthe Cemetery Database </a>\" page which everyone should consult prior to \r\nconducting a search. After looking in the <a href=\"http://www.rootsweb.com/~rigenweb/cemetery/\" target=\"_new\">online index \r\n</a>(containing 414,000 names, on RootsWeb) you can contact one of the libraries \r\nlisted below for a printout of the record. Please contact the library in advance \r\nof your request to find out their policy for requesting the full citation. Bear \r\nin mind, there may be a fee for this service. The website also lists <a href=\"http://members.tripod.com/debyns/ceme_des.html\" target=\"_new\">complete \r\ndescriptions </a>of how to find each of the cemeteries. </p>\r\n<p>It will take some time before the cemetery database becomes available on CD, \r\nas there is still work to be done to improve the accuracy of the data. However, \r\npublished volumes of eight towns are accurate and currently available through \r\nthe NEHGS bookstore . The cemetery database <a href=\"http://members.tripod.com/~debyns/book.html\" target=\"_new\">website</a>is \r\nalso the best place to find out what towns are included in the books. </p>\r\n<p>While John Sterling is ending his eleven-year involvement with the project, \r\nDeby Jecoy Nunes will continue. Sterling estimates that over ninety-five percent \r\nof the pre-twentieth century gravestones in Rhode Island are in the database. \r\nWhen he began the project in 1990 there were 1,862 registered historical \r\ncemeteries in the state. In eleven years, forty volunteers have found and \r\nregistered an additional 1,171 cemeteries (over one hundred per year), bringing \r\nthe total to 3,033. They have recorded 414,000 inscriptions and entered them \r\ninto the database. </p>\r\n<p>When I asked Sterling about the future of the project, he told me about using \r\na global positioning system (GPS) to find the coordinates to locate the \r\ncemeteries. This will take a while since only one hundred cemeteries have been \r\nfound so far using this method. What this means is that you can use the \r\ncoordinates to navigate to within ten meters of a cemetery located \r\nthree-quarters of a mile from the nearest road, using a GPS instrument, or in \r\nthe future, a cell phone. You'll even know how many feet you have to walk to \r\nreach it. After an incredible amount of time and effort spent over the last \r\ndecade, Sterling's team of dedicated volunteers have almost completed a \r\nmonumental task. Researchers no longer have to search in vain for cemetery \r\ninformation. The volunteers have even located many of the small family plots \r\nthat were overgrown and in many cases lost. There is no question that John \r\nSterling and his team of volunteers made a valuable contribution to Rhode Island \r\ngenealogy. Keep up the good work! </p>\r\n<p>If you are interested in volunteering for the Rhode Island Cemetery project, \r\ncontact <a href=\"mailto:debyns@lori.state.ri.us\">Deby Jecoy Nunes </a>.</p>\r\n<br><p><strong>Useful Addresses</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.afgs.org/\" target=\"_new\">American French Genealogical \r\nSociety </a><br>78 Earle Street<br>Woonsocket, RI 02861 <br>Mailing Address: \r\nP.O.

Taylor", "country": "Rhode Island", "title": "The Rhode Island Federal Census", "content": "<p>This is the first article in a series on census records for Rhode Island. \r\nMany researchers use the population schedules, but are unaware of other types of \r\ncensus materials that exist, such as special schedules (agricultural, \r\nmanufacturing, mortality, and veterans), state censuses, and city and town \r\ncensus reports. This column focuses on the federal census material that exists \r\nfor Rhode Island (both population and special schedules). There is a tremendous \r\namount of information in census records if you know what&#8217;s available and how to \r\nuse them. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p><strong>Background</strong></p>\r\n<p>Federal censuses began in 1790 and have been taken every ten years since \r\nthen. Since the United States government only releases census schedules \r\nseventy-two years after they were created, this means that census material from \r\n1790 through 1930 is currently available. The next release (1940) won&#8217;t be \r\nreleased until 2012. To better understand the federal census, researchers should \r\nconsult Loretto Szucs&#8217; advice in the chapter &#8220;Research in Census Records&#8221; from \r\n<em>The Source: A Guidebook of American Genealogy</em>, <em>Revised Edition</em> \r\n(Salt Lake City, Ancestry, 1997, pp103-46) and Kathleen W. Hinckley&#8217;s <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Your-Guide-Federal-Census-Genealogists/dp/1558705880\" target=\"_blank\">Your Guide to the Federal Census</a></em> (Betterway, 2002). </p>\r\n<p>Before you start using the federal census there are things that you need to \r\nknow about what information was enumerated and when. Hinckley neatly outlines \r\nthe basic tools of using the census for genealogical research in her book with \r\ncharts and well-organized chapters. Researchers should be aware of the following \r\nbasic &#8220;facts&#8221; of using the federal census as presented in Hinckley&#8217;s book: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1790&#8211;1840: Only lists the head of household and then the number of people in \r\neach household. </li>\r\n<li>1850&#8211;1930: Name of each individual in the household was enumerated. </li>\r\n<li>1880: This was the first census to list the street name and house number. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>1790&#8211;1840: Divided family members by sex and age ranges. </li>\r\n<li>1830: Included a category for individuals over 100 years of age. </li>\r\n<li>1900: Reported the month and year of birth for each person.&#160; </li>\r\n<li>1850&#8211;1930: Lists the place of birth of each person enumerated. </li>\r\n<li>1880: Birthplace of individual&#8217;s parents is noted. </li>\r\n<li>1850&#8211;1890: Enumerators asked if couples were married within the past year. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>1880&#8211;1930: Marital status recorded. </li>\r\n<li>1930: Age at first marriage was reported. </li>\r\n<li>1890&#8211;1910: Number of children born and number still living. </li>\r\n<li>1880: Household relationships recorded (This can help you find other \r\nrelatives living in the same dwelling.) </li>\r\n<li>1820: First census to ask about citizenship. </li>\r\n<li>1900&#8211;1930: Indicated the person&#8217;s naturalization status. </li>\r\n<li>1850: First census to report the occupation of males in the household \r\n(female occupations weren&#8217;t counted until 1870). </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Every researcher should keep in mind the following tip from Hinckley &#8212;&#160; \r\n&#8220;there are always exceptions.&#8221; Census enumerators often recorded additional \r\ninformation that they found interesting. By the same token, they sometimes \r\nneglected to record information that should be in the census.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Where to Find the Census</strong></p>\r\n<p>For most enumerations in the nineteenth century there were multiple schedules \r\ntreating a variety of economic and social matters, but many have been destroyed. \r\nSurviving originals are widely scattered. The Rhode Island State Archives \r\n(RISA), the Rhode Island Historical Society Library (RIHS) and the <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/\" target=\"new\">National Archives </a>have a mix of \r\noriginals, duplicate copies, and microfilm. The National Archives has microfilms \r\nof the population census for Rhode Island. <a href=\"http://www.ancestry.com/\" target=\"new\">Ancestry.com </a>and <a href=\"http://genealogy.com/\" target=\"new\">Genealogy.com</a> have digitized versions of the census available \r\nonline to subscribers of their databases.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.state.ri.us/archives/\" target=\"new\">The Rhode Island State \r\nArchives</a><br>337 Westminster St., Providence, RI 02903<br>(401) \r\n222-2353<br><br><a href=\"http://www.rihs.org/\" target=\"new\">Rhode Island \r\nHistorical Society Library </a><br>121 Hope St., Providence, RI 02906<br>(401) \r\n331-8575</p>\r\n<p><strong>What Exists: Population Schedules</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>1790&#8211;1880; 1900&#8211;1930 </strong></p>\r\n<p>The population schedule is what most people think of as &#8220;the census.&#8221; The \r\ngood news is that all years have been microfilmed by the National Archives and \r\nwidely distributed. The NEHGS Library has microfilms for all New England states \r\nfrom 1790 to 1880 and 1900 to 1930. The census of 1890 for Rhode Island, with \r\nthe exception of the veterans&#8217; schedules, was destroyed in a fire. </p>\r\n<p>The 1790 census is available in printed form as well in Bureau of the Census, \r\n<em>Heads of Families at the First Census of the United States Taken in the Year \r\n1790: Rhode Island</em> (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1908) </p>\r\n<p><strong>Indexes</strong></p>\r\n<p>Surviving Rhode Island population schedules are indexed, with the exception \r\nof 1910 and 1930.&#160; Most indexes from 1790 to 1870 have been commercially \r\nproduced and advertised extensively. For the 1880, 1900, and 1920 Rhode Island \r\nreturns, phonetic indexes (called Soundex) were federally prepared and have been \r\nwidely disseminated on microfilm by the National Archives. </p>\r\n<p>The unindexed census presents special challenges for researchers, especially \r\nwhen trying to locate an individual in an urban setting. There are tools that \r\nmake that process easier. For instance, city directories cite street addresses \r\nand the Census Bureau&#8217;s separately filmed <em>Descriptions of Census Enumeration \r\nDistricts, 1830&#8211;1890 and 1910&#8211;1950</em> (National Archives micropublication \r\nT1224) helps identify the correct enumeration district. The corresponding census \r\nenumeration district maps at the National Archives and those created by the \r\nRhode Island Historical Society for 1910 also help. Manuscript maps held by the \r\nNational Archives include six Rhode Island cities: Central Falls, Cranston, \r\nNewport, Pawtucket, Providence, and Woonsocket. Once a street address is known \r\nin these cities, an order for the corresponding map can be addressed \r\nto<br><br>Cartographic and Architectural Branch (NNSC)<br>National Archives at \r\nCollege Park<br>8601 Adelphi Road, <br>College Park, MD 20740-6001. <br><br>A \r\nhelpful discussion of these tools and examples of how to use them appears in the \r\nspring 1993 issue of <em>Prologue</em>, the quarterly of the National Archives, \r\nwhich is available in the government documents section of many libraries.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Special Schedules</strong></p>\r\n<p>The following schedules can be found at either the Rhode Island State \r\nArchives (RISA) or the National Archives. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Agricultural Schedules 1850&#8211;80 (RISA)</strong> <br>These enumerate farms with \r\nan annual produce of at least $100 (1850&#8211;60) or $500 (1870&#8211;80) giving names of \r\nowner (or tenant), acreage, and both type and quantity of livestock and \r\nagricultural production.&#160; Rhode Island&#8217;s agricultural manufacturing and \r\nmortality schedules are not among those microfilmed by the National Archives. \r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Manufacturing Schedules: 1810, 1820 (National Archives); 1850&#8211;60, 1880 \r\n(RISA) </strong>Qualifications for inclusion varied across time. Only two pages of \r\nthe 1810 Rhode Island schedule survive. These pages represent Kent County and \r\nhave not been microfilmed (NARA houses them with materials from Record Group 29, \r\nBureau of the Census).&#160; For 1850 to 1870, the schedules include fishing, \r\nmercantile, and mining operations that grossed at least $500 per year. The 1880 \r\nschedule focused on general industry. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Mortality Schedules: 1850&#8211;1880 (RISA)</strong> <br>Theoretically, the mortality \r\nschedules in these census years list all individuals who died within twelve \r\nmonths prior to the office census date (June 1), giving such personal data as \r\nname, age, birthplace, race, and cause of death. In reality, the returns are far \r\nfrom complete but still invaluable. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Veterans&#8217; Schedules: 1890 (National Archives)</strong>. <br>Union veterans and \r\ntheir widows appear on a special schedule that includes name; veteran&#8217;s rank, \r\ncompany, and regiment or vessel; dates of enlistment and discharge; length of \r\nservice; post office address; and disabilities. These are the only known \r\nsurviving schedules for Rhode Island in 1890. There is an index to this census \r\nschedule. </p>\r\n<p>Remember to keep good records of the census pages you locate. Print out a \r\ncopy of the page so that you can refer to it again in the future or use a \r\nspecial pre-printed form for transcribing information. In the rush to find your \r\nnext ancestor in the census, you might overlook a vital clue offered by a census \r\ndocument. Transcribing full information and making copies enables you to consult \r\nthe pages for additional material when you reach a research roadblock. </p>\r\n<p>So now that you are aware of the wide range of censuses available to track \r\ndown those Rhode Island ancestors, you can use them to expand what you know \r\nabout those individuals. You are sure to find data that you didn&#8217;t know, such as \r\noccupations, number of marriages, and previously unknown children. </p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/the-rhode-island-federal-census/", "published": "June 6, 2003", "id": 403}, {"author": "Maureen A. Taylor ", "country": "Rhode Island", "title": "They Went in All Directions: Rhode Islanders On the Move", "content": "<p>In almost every family genealogy there are people that disappear having &#8220;gone \r\nwest.&#8221;&#160;This refers to any territory west of where the rest of the family lived. \r\nDepending on when your ancestor got that restless feeling it could be New York \r\nor California. Your Rhode Island family tree may have several individuals who \r\nmigrated to other areas of the country or even within the state. These wanderers \r\nwent north, south, west, and even east (into Massachusetts). A few resources and \r\nresearch rules will help you locate them and add a little missing information to \r\nthose genealogical charts. </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p><strong>Rule #1</strong></p>\r\n<strong>Know your Rhode Island history</strong><p>This little rule can&#8217;t be repeated enough. Unless you understand the \r\nhistorical events that influence the decision of your ancestor you&#8217;ll never know \r\nwhere to look for information. Start with general historical works like Sydney \r\nJames&#8217; <em>Colonial Rhode Island: A History</em> (New York: Scribner, 1975) or \r\nWilliam McLoughlin&#8217;s <em>Rhode Island</em> (New York: W.W. Norton, 1986). They \r\nhelp you fill in the timeline of occurrences during your migratory ancestor&#8217;s \r\nlifetime. Another classic is Stewart Hall Holbrook&#8217;s <em>The Yankee Exodus, An \r\nAccount of Migration from New England</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1950). In it he \r\ncovers the various places New Englanders migrated to, as well as how and why. \r\nSome people, encouraged by advertisements from various emigration companies, \r\nsought economic opportunity elsewhere. Other folks just liked to wander. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Rule #2<br>Follow the transportation systems and trade routes. </strong></p>\r\n<p>Highways were necessary for commerce, but they also carried individuals away \r\nfrom their original point of settlement. Some of these colonial highways became \r\nthe turnpikes of the nineteenth century and are still there today (such as Post \r\nRoad [Route 1]). Remember that travel was slow even after 1750, when old Indian \r\npaths became wagon routes with most travelers averaging twenty miles a day in \r\ngood weather. </p>\r\n<p>Transportation into and out of Rhode Island also occurred along the major \r\nwaterways, both man-made and natural. Narragansett Bay and the Blackstone River \r\nboth carried settlers and traders. With so many islands in Narragansett Bay it \r\nis not surprising that some Rhode Island families held land in several \r\nlocations. For instance, those operating plantations along the western edge of \r\nNarragansett Bay often owned additional land in Jamestown (Conanicut Island) or \r\nhad business connections in Newport. Traversing the waterway was necessary to \r\noversee management of their estates. Steamboat travel between major cities began \r\nin various cities between 1812 and 1816, linking Rhode Island with Connecticut \r\nand New York via the Long Island Sound. The Blackstone Canal primarily carried \r\ngoods (and probably a few people) between Providence, Rhode Island, and \r\nWorcester, Massachusetts, starting in 1828, but it was replaced by the railroads \r\nin the 1840s. The advent of railroads enabled the transporting of large groups \r\nof people between states and immigrating to other geographic areas became even \r\neasier. Passengers made connections to different lines and most small towns had \r\nstations. </p>\r\n<p>Maps are the best way to trace the transportation routes used by your \r\nancestors. You can find some online at the <a href=\"http://www.loc.gov/\" target=\"new\">Library of Congress website</a> under the American Memory page, and \r\nin libraries. The graphics division of the <a href=\"http://www.rihs.org/\" target=\"new\">Rhode Island Historical Society Library</a> has the most complete set \r\nof maps in the state, followed by the <a href=\"http://www.state.ri.us/archives/\" target=\"new\">Rhode Island State Archives</a>.&#160; Also consult William Dollarhide&#8217;s \r\n<em>Map Guide to American Migration Routes, 1735-1815</em> (Bountiful, Utah: \r\nHeritage Quest, 1997) and Douglas Waitley&#8217;s <em>Roads of Destiny: The Trails that \r\nShaped a Nation</em> (New York: Robert B. Luce, 1970). </p>\r\n<p><strong>Rule #3<br>Discover your ancestors&#8217; reasons for migrating</strong> </p>\r\n<p>Most families migrated due to the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Economic opportunity</strong></p>\r\n<p>Plentiful land in the South and West brought young men seeking farmland while \r\nthe availability of jobs enticed them to travel into Rhode Island. According to \r\nthe 1865 census of Rhode Island, men from Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, \r\nSouth Carolina, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi were living in the state. \r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>War</strong></p>\r\n<p>Military conflict resulted in soldiers serving in areas outside their \r\nhometowns. In addition, political upheavals may have caused populations to flee. \r\nFor instance, during the American Revolution, many of the loyalists living in \r\nNewport, Rhode Island, fled Aquidneck Island to Canada where they established a \r\ncity of the same name in Nova Scotia.&#160; Revolutionary War general Nathaniel \r\nGreene, a Rhode Island native, spent time commanding campaigns in Georgia and \r\nSouth Carolina. In 1785 he decided to move his family to the plantation awarded \r\nhim by the government of Georgia. Some pensioners of the Revolutionary War \r\nreceived bounty land in Ohio for their service, which encouraged many to settle \r\nthere.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Education</strong></p>\r\n<p>Established southern families sent sons north to study at elite universities, \r\nso don&#8217;t be surprised to find your Rhode Island ancestor with southern roots. \r\nAfter the Civil War, Bathsheba A. Benedict of Pawtucket purchased a plantation \r\nnear Columbia, South Carolina, to educate freed slaves under the auspices of the \r\nAmerican Baptist Home Mission Society. Benedict College, founded as Benedict \r\nInstitute in 1870, originally trained teachers and ministers. Many of those \r\nstudents migrated north after they graduated. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Seasonal Travel</strong></p>\r\n<p>Wealthy families and their servants often traveled during the social season. \r\nNewport families went to Saratoga Springs, New York, and New York City families \r\nmigrated to Newport, building many of the mansions still in existence today. \r\nThere was seasonal travel among the families on the Social Register and many of \r\nthose individuals intermarried, dividing their time between Rhode Island and \r\ntheir homes. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Relatives</strong></p>\r\n<p>Marriage between prominent families formed business and social connections \r\nregardless of location. These marital alliances meant that records regarding the \r\nfamilies &#8212; including vital records, census documents and land records &#8212;are in at \r\nleast two locations. While one of General Greene&#8217;s children grew up in the \r\nsouth, Nathaniel returned to Rhode Island when he married Ann Clarke. </p>\r\n<p>Just as immigrant families often settled in the same areas as their homeland \r\nneighbors, migrating groups of Rhode Islanders did the same. Many people from \r\nsmall towns banded together to settle towns and cities in the West. The best \r\nresource is Holbrook&#8217;s <em>Yankee Exodus</em>.&#160; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Religion</strong></p>\r\n<p>Many of the original settlers of New England were refugees from religious \r\npersecution, but in later generations traveling missionaries established new \r\ncommunities of believers For example, a group of Newport Quakers traveled to \r\nCharleston, South Carolina, to form a religious community. A good source of \r\ninformation on migratory Quakers is William Wade Hinshaw&#8217;s <em>Encyclopedia of \r\nAmerican Quaker Genealogy</em> (Ann Arbor, Michigan: Edwards Brothers, 1936). \r\nSearch for parish records for evidence of where your ancestors went. Sometimes \r\nyou can find a paper trail dismissing them from one church to join another.&#160; \r\n</p>\r\n<strong>Rule #4<br>Research all collateral lines</strong><p>It makes sense when you have trouble tracking that migrant member of your \r\nfamily to go back to your family tree. The clues may be in the papers you locate \r\nfor a collateral relative. Those emigrant ancestors might have sent home letters \r\nor photographs so make sure to use online resources like message boards to \r\nconnect with distant cousins and look at published genealogies for clues. Don&#8217;t \r\nforget to research periodicals using the Periodical Source Index (PERSI) online \r\nat <a href=\"http://www.ancestry.com/\">Ancestry.com</a>. The <em>Rhode Island \r\nGenealogical Register</em> ran a column called &#8220;They left Rhode Island.&#8221; You \r\nnever know where you&#8217;ll find the information to solve your research puzzle. </p>\r\n<p>If your ancestors were restless you might have difficulty finding them \r\nbecause there were multiple migrations. Look for clues in family papers, \r\nphotographs (check the photographer&#8217;s imprint), and research each family member \r\nto see if you can find out where they went. Online research makes it easier to \r\nsearch large groups of records at one time (census, city directories, etc) or \r\nplace a query on a message board. While you&#8217;ll have to double-check all the \r\nonline information you find with traditional research and original source \r\nmaterial, looking online makes sense when you don&#8217;t know where to find a person. \r\nOnce you&#8217;ve completed your research, tell the story of your search and what you \r\nfound for future generations. </p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/rhode-islanders-on-the-move/", "published": "April 25, 2003", "id": 404}, {"author": "Maureen A.

This \r\ncolumn will offer advice on how to uncover this recent history in Rhode Island. \r\nWe will review a few sources covered in earlier columns, as well as some that \r\napply only to the twentieth century. \r\n</p>\r\n<div id=\"center-column\"><div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p><strong>Ask Relatives</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is pretty basic, but oral history needs to be verified \r\nor you can end up barking up the wrong family tree. Start with a list of simple \r\nquestions &#8212; birth, marriage, residences, schools attended, and employment, and \r\nthen approach your relatives for their life stories. This may produce some \r\nsurprising results. During the interview process I discovered that females in my \r\nfamily generally use their middle names for everyday documents except when the \r\nrecord seems &#8220;official&#8221; &#8212; then they use their first names. Needless to say, this \r\nbusiness of interchangeable first names makes the verification process a little \r\nmore difficult!</p>\r\n<p><strong>One Year at a Time: City Directories and Telephone \r\nListings</strong></p>\r\n<p>After asking lots of questions, work backwards in history for \r\neach person and create timelines of events that include source evidence for each \r\nfact. Don&#8217;t forget to track yourself as well. You may be surprised by the amount \r\nof misinformation that you will discover. </p>\r\n<p>A wide variety of records await the twentieth-century \r\nresearcher. . Start your year-by-year chart of who was where with the help of \r\ncity directories. Directories generally list heads of households and can include \r\nany employed resident, but coverage is spotty for some neighborhoods. Major \r\ncities like Providence, Pawtucket, and Newport have annual city directories, but \r\nsmaller cities and towns are often grouped together into volumes and issued \r\nsporadically. The best collections are at the Rhode Island Historical Society, \r\nthe New England Historic Genealogical Society, and the Library of Congress. Some \r\ndirectories are available on microfilm from the Family History Library and \r\nothers are online at <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.ancestry.com/\">Ancestry.com</a>. </p>\r\n<p>Telephone directories &#8212; in print form, on CD-ROM, and online \r\n&#8212; are commonly used today to track living or recently deceased relatives. \r\nTelephone books are available from the late nineteenth century to the present \r\nday, and are often found at the main branches of public libraries. Use care when \r\nusing them because they were printed on poor quality paper that becomes brittle. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Online directories: Hinckley did a comparison of the major \r\nonline telephone directory sites and found several discrepancies. This means you \r\nshould check each one to be thorough.

Don&#8217;t forget to check for individuals listed under first initials \r\nand watch for widows who continue to maintain the listing under their husband&#8217;s \r\nname. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>\r\n<p>There will be times when you&#8217;ll be denied access to certain \r\nrecent records because of confidentiality laws. This is especially true with \r\nvital records and court documents. To receive a copy of a birth or marriage \r\nrecord less than a hundred years old or a death record less than fifty years old \r\nfrom either the Rhode Island Division of Vital Records or a city or town clerk \r\nyou will need to show a relationship, supply information (see below), and pay a \r\nfee. Make your request in writing and provide the following: name on the record, \r\ndate of the event (birth, marriage, or death), city or town where it occurred, \r\nyour relationship to the individual, and why you need the copy. If you are \r\nrequesting a birth record, you will also need to supply the name of the father \r\nand the mother&#8217;s maiden name.</p>\r\n<p>According to the Judicial Records Center website, access to \r\ntwentieth-century civil, criminal, and divorce records are &#8220;available to \r\nresearchers in accordance with the laws of Rhode Island and the operating rules \r\nof the department.&#8221; A driver&#8217;s license or Rhode Island Identification Card must \r\nbe shown in order to view a case file.

Even if your family never owned the building \r\nthey lived in they might have owned land, a cemetery plot, or income property \r\nlike an apartment house. Tax records are also available to the public at the \r\ntown or city hall. </p>\r\n<p>You might be able to find out if your twentieth-century \r\nancestors were good students and maybe even see their school photo by contacting \r\nthe private or parochial school they attended for records. Public school records \r\nare usually the property of the municipal school department. School yearbooks \r\nand class photographs may exist in the collections of local historical societies \r\nor public libraries.</p>\r\n<p>News outlets offer unique opportunities for twentieth-century \r\nresearch.

The Providence Public Library has a \r\ncard index to significant news events published in the <em>Providence \r\nJournal</em>.&#160; </p>\r\n<p>In the 1970s the Rhode Island Historical Society began \r\ncollecting news footage from the three local television stations. Most of the \r\ncollection is still unavailable to researchers unless they know the specific day \r\nthat a story aired. The exception is the film from the station WJAR, for which \r\nan index now exists. Bear in mind that this archive only includes major local \r\nnews stories and that duplication may not be possible.

With more than fifteen titles to his credit, including the serial \r\npublication <em>The Narragansett Historical Register</em>, Arnold labored more \r\nthan forty years saving Rhode Island&#8217;s heritage. He spent seventeen years \r\nabstracting the classic <em>Vital Record of Rhode Island</em> in twenty-one \r\nvolumes, which took twenty-one years to publish (1891-1912), with support from \r\nthe Rhode Island General Assembly.</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>Rather than just abstracting births, marriages, and deaths found in town \r\nrecords, Arnold sought out church records, wills, and even newspapers. The first \r\nsix volumes covered each Rhode Island county broken down by town; volume seven \r\nfocused on Quaker records and ministers; volumes eight through eleven abstracted \r\nchurch records; volume twelve included the names of Revolutionary War soldiers \r\nand began his publication of newspaper records that continued to volume \r\ntwenty-one. He attempted to cover all the cities and towns of Rhode Island from \r\ntheir founding until the beginning of civil registration in 1850. While the \r\ncoverage varied between volumes, the Arnold set is generally considered to cover \r\nthe period 1636 to 1850. He tackled a formidable task and as a result, several \r\ngenerations of researchers have been able to locate ancestors by consulting a \r\nsingle set of books. </p>\r\n<p>Novice users of Arnold&#8217;s <em>Vital Record of Rhode Island </em>often become \r\nconfused about his format, but after consulting his notes in volume one (under \r\nthe heading &#8220;Please Observe&#8221;) a few things become clearer. Each town has a \r\nseparate surname-only index and separate pagination as well as a few details \r\nabout the community. Each index contains three sections: &#8220;Names occurring in \r\ntheir natural order,&#8221; &#8220;Names occurring promiscuously,&#8221; and&#160; &#8220;Places mentioned in \r\nthe text.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>Arnold also stated that he presented names &#8220;as they stand on the record, when \r\nthey are not too far wrong.&#8221; That means that he changed some spellings, and with \r\nestimates of Arnold&#8217;s accuracy suggested by some as fifty percent, it appears \r\nthat there are more changes than original spellings. To enable researchers to \r\ncheck listings against the original document, Arnold included the volume and \r\npage where each citation was found in the town records. Researchers searching \r\nfor marriages need to be aware that the full citation only appears under the \r\ngroom&#8217;s name; the bride&#8217;s entry contains just the name, date of the event, and \r\nvolume and page of the record. </p>\r\n<p>Now that NEHGS has placed Arnold&#8217;s information into a <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/research/services/RI.aspx\">database</a>, searching those volumes is even \r\neasier.&#160; NEHGS members no longer have to painstakingly search each surname index \r\nand check each page for an ancestor of uncertain origin. Search terms include \r\nfirst name, last name, type of record (birth, marriage, death, or all), town, \r\nkeyword or phrase, volume and page number, and the ability to refine the search \r\nto a set of years. It is possible to search all towns at one time by filling in \r\na first and last name. Consult the search tips before using the database to \r\nfully understand the quirks of using both the original Arnold volumes and the \r\ndatabase. For instance, searching by surname will locate all instances of the \r\nname, not just surnames because the database is not sorted by field.&#160; One of the \r\nconfusing features of the original books was Arnold&#8217;s arrangement of family \r\ngroups. For example, let&#8217;s look at the family of John and Isabella Waterman of \r\nWarwick.</p>\r\n<p>In the printed version of Arnold they appear as follows: (Arnold cited them \r\nas 4-71; volume four, page seventy-one of the original Warwick town records)</p>\r\n<p>Waterman, John Robinson, of Dea. John and Welthian, February 19, 1783 [also \r\n2-218]</p>\r\n<p>Isabella (Warren, of Thomas and Mary), Sept. 13, 1783 [also 3-33]</p>\r\n<p>Louisa, of John R. and Isabella [3-33] August 26, 1806</p>\r\n<p>Maria&#160;[3-33] Mar. 27, 1808</p>\r\n<p>Maria&#160;[3-33] d. Aug. 5. 1808</p>\r\n<p>The Arnold abstract continues by listing eleven other children (six of whom \r\ndied) and a death date for Isabella, wife of John R., who died January 24, 1832. \r\nArnold interpreted the information in the town records and gathered data on \r\nfamily groups together in one place &#8212; alphabetically under surname. It&#8217;s \r\nastounding to think that he could accomplish this project without a computer. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Arnold arranged family groups as he found them in the original record, \r\nusually listing the parents first, followed by all birth and death dates of \r\nchildren, and lastly, any other references in which they appeared. The numbers \r\nin brackets refer to additional citations in those volumes and page numbers. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Using the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/http://www.americanancestors.org/research/services/RI.aspx\">online database</a> you can \r\nsearch the entire set of Arnold&#8217;s <em>Vital Record</em> for all persons named \r\nWaterman, even if you don&#8217;t know what town they originated in. You may also \r\nsearch specifically for Isabella Waterman (or any other member of the family) by \r\nbirth, marriage, death, or all events. It is also possible, after selecting a \r\ntown, to search by volume and page for a specific reference. For instance, a \r\nsearch for Isabella Waterman in the town of Warwick revealed seven citations for \r\nbirths, marriages, and deaths. The standard fields in the results page of the \r\ndatabase are: year (of event), family name, record, original record, original \r\nvolume and page, and town. Selecting the &#8220;more&#8221; link under the original record \r\nfield allows you to view the record in its original context, while choosing \r\n&#8220;town&#8221; provides a full citation for the published series and introductory matter \r\nfor the town. Because the database is not field indexed, you will also find a \r\nmarriage for an Isabella Warren to a John R. Waterman along with several \r\nlistings for Isabella Waterman. You may also search by keyword or phrase, but be \r\naware that entering a name such as Isabella Waterman into this field will limit \r\nthe results to only entries recorded exactly as Isabella Waterman. You are \r\nlikely to miss many relevant records when using this search. For example, a \r\nkeyword or phrase search on Isabella Waterman will produce the following single \r\nresult (only record and record type are listed here):</p>\r\n<p>COLBURN Rev. Alfred, and Isabella Waterman ; m. by Rev. John Dowling, June \r\n21, 1842&#160; - Marriage</p>\r\n<p>However, if you use the first name/last name search you will get the \r\nfollowing results:</p>\r\n<p>COLBURN Rev. Alfred, and Isabella Waterman ; m. by Rev. John Dowling, June \r\n21, 1842. - Marriage<br>VINALL Gideon, of Gideon, of New Bedford, Mass., and \r\nIsabella Field, of Oliver W., of Providence ; m. by Rev. Thomas T. Waterman, \r\nJuly 2, 1846. - Marriage</p>\r\n<p>Warren Isabella, and John R. Waterman, Nov. 3, 1805. - Marriage</p>\r\n<p>Waterman Isabella (Warren of Thomas and Mary), Sept. 13, 1783. [also 3-33] - \r\nBirth</p>\r\n<p>Waterman John R., son of Dea. John and Welthian, and Isabella Warren, of \r\nThomas and Mary ; m. by Eld. Samuel Littlefield, Nov. 3, 1805. - Marriage</p>\r\n<p>Waterman Louisa, of John R. and Isabella, [3-33] Aug. 26, 1806. - Birth</p>\r\n<p>Waterman Isabella, Nov. 1, 1819. - Birth</p>\r\n<p>Waterman Richard, of John R. and Isabella, and Dianna Maria Chapin, Feb. 15, \r\n1831. - Marriage</p>\r\n<p>Waterman Isabella, wife of John R., died Jan. 24, 1832. - Death</p>\r\n<p>WATERMAN Isabella, and Rev. Alfred Colburn, June 21, 1842. - Marriage</p>\r\n<p>While performing a keyword/phrase search on names will minimize the number of \r\nhits for common names such as &#8220;John Brown&#8221; (first name/last name search will \r\nbring up all occurrences of &#8220;John&#8221; and of &#8220;Brown&#8221;), you will undoubtedly miss \r\nvaluable information that may have been entered as Brown, John; Brown, son of \r\nJohn; John T. Brown, and any other variety that may have been entered. \r\nTraditional research requires the repetitive task of going through many pages of \r\nrecords and the same techniques must be observed in the online database in order \r\nto find every relevant record. </p>\r\n<p>All of the information that appeared in the original published volumes has \r\nbeen transferred to the database, but it may take a few clicks to find all \r\nlinks. In the case of Isabella Waterman, the original record appeared in volume \r\nfour, page seventy-one of the Warwick town records. However, Arnold also added \r\nan additional citation for volume three, page thirty-three. In order to find \r\nthat record it is necessary to go back to the search field and fill in Isabella \r\nWaterman, select the town of Warwick and specify a search for that volume and \r\npage. This record will be highlighted and show you what else appeared on that \r\npage in the original volume, according to Arnold&#8217;s transcription.</p>\r\n<p>Whether you use the printed or online version of Arnold&#8217;s set, you should \r\nalways return to the original documents for the specific towns. There are many \r\ndiscrepancies in the original Arnold transcriptions. There is evidence of \r\nspelling changes and misinterpretation of the family data presented in the town \r\nrecords. It is not necessary to travel to Rhode Island to access the town \r\ndocuments. While the original records are available on microfilm at the Rhode \r\nIsland Historical Society Library (121 Hope St, Providence, RI, 02906), these \r\nreels can also be ordered directly through the Family History Libraries of the \r\nChurch of Latter-day Saints or via the NEHGS library.

This interest will increase with the years to come.&#8221; \r\n<em>(Register </em>44 [1890]: p.317). The original volume sold for a mere $4.50.&#160; \r\nToday, with the complete set difficult to find in print, the NEHGS database is a \r\nwelcome addition to the electronic resources for genealogical research in Rhode \r\nIsland. </p>\r\n<p><em>Note</em>: The complete database will take several months to complete, so \r\nresearchers interested in towns not currently in the database should check back \r\non a weekly basis and subscribe to the <em>NEHGS </em><em>e-News</em> for \r\nregular updates. </p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/using-arnolds-vital-record-of-rhode-island/", "published": "October 4, 2002", "id": 406}, {"author": "Maureen A.

The term &#8220;gone west&#8221; meant different places to different \r\ngenerations. For instance, if your ancestor migrated west in 1790 they probably \r\nwent as far as New York, but if they went west in 1900 you might find them on \r\nthe California coast or in Alaska. Stewart Holbrook&#8217;s <em>The Yankee \r\nExodus</em>: <em>An Account of Migration from New England</em> (Macmillan, 1950 \r\nout of print) provides an excellent overview of the settlement of this country. \r\nHe mentions many Rhode Island family names.

In the eighteenth and nineteenth century, individuals \r\nfrequently traveled in groups bringing along family, friends and neighbors \r\nrecreating the feel of home in their new state or territory. Eighteenth century \r\nnewspapers carried notices about the availability of land enticing people to \r\nmove to the Susquehannah area of Pennsylvania , the western regions of Virginia \r\nas well as closer to home in New Hampshire and Vermont.

Here are \r\nsome of the states and notable groups that left Little Rhody to seek their \r\nfuture further west. <br><br><strong>California</strong><br>The Gold Rush of \r\n1849 beckoned to Rhode Islanders. By 1850 there were at least 860 individuals \r\nfrom the state living in the area with double that number a decade later. \r\n<br><br><strong>New York</strong><br>Many Rhode Islanders moved to New York \r\ncounties such as Broome, Chemung, Columbia, Ontario, Saratoga, Schuyler, \r\nTompkins, and Tioga. Relevant articles on these individuals appear in <em>Rhode \r\nIsland Roots</em>. <br><br><strong>Illinois</strong><br>A group calling \r\nthemselves the Pawtucket Western Emigrating Society left the state in 1836 to \r\nsettle Providence, Illinois. Elizabeth J. Johnson and James L. Wheaton IV wrote \r\nan article, &#8220;The Pawtucket Western Emigrating Society&#8221; (<em>Rhode Island \r\nRoots</em>, vol. 12, no. 3, September 1986) that lists members and contains a \r\nmap of the new settlement. The Providence Farmer&#8217;s and Mechanic Emigrating \r\nSociety founded Mount Hope while another group of Rhode Islanders settled \r\nDelavan in the 1830s. <br><br><strong>Kansas</strong><br>In Holbrook&#8217;s book, he \r\nmentions the Vegetarian Settlement Company (1856) that aimed under the \r\nleadership of Henry Clubb to establish a permanent home for vegetarians at \r\n&#8220;Octagon City.&#8221; Among the settlers were Mr. and Mrs. William Sommerville of \r\nLonsdale, Rhode Island. The settlement failed. A Mrs. Colt wrote a memoir of her \r\nexperiences, <em>Went to Kansas, Being a Thrilling Account of an Ill-Fated \r\nExpedition to that Fairy Land, and Its Sad Results</em> (1862). Non-vegetarian \r\nRhode Islanders with these surnames: Beatley, Burrow, Bush, Cowell, Davis, \r\nDouglass, Fuller, and Pearce moved to Kansas and \r\nstayed.<br><br><strong>Wisconsin</strong><br>After King Phillip&#8217;s War in the \r\nseventeenth century, the native populations of Rhode Island ended up scattered. \r\nSome of the Narragansett tribal members eventually ended up in Wisconsin as part \r\nof a group known as The Brothertown Indians. Additional information is on their \r\nwebsite. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.brothertownindians.org/\">www.brothertownindians.org/</a>. The NEHGS library has a \r\ncollection of papers relating to the tribe in the R. Stanton Avery Special \r\nCollections Department. <br><br>Rhode Islanders went in all directions&#8212;north, \r\nsouth, east and west seeking a new start. For everyone that left, a less \r\nadventurous relative stayed behind. When you find what you seek, think about \r\nwriting an article about it. Other Rhode Island genealogists will appreciate it. \r\n<br><br></div></div></div></div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/westward-ho/", "published": "", "id": 407}, {"author": "Maureen A.

It is \r\narranged alphabetically by county and then by towns within the county. If you \r\nare not sure of the county, an outline map of the state is provided, followed by \r\nan index to towns. Each county entry starts with a detailed county map showing \r\nthe present borders of each town including main and secondary roads leading \r\nbetween the villages. There is a map of each town that shows all the roads \r\n(except those in densely populated villages) and many geographical features \r\n(parks, brooks, ponds, mountains) including the location of every cemetery. A \r\nchart gives the name of each cemetery (note that these are the current names and \r\nsometimes differ with those listed in the Vermont Vital Records Card Index, \r\n1760-1870, produced in the early twentieth century), first and last year used, \r\nwhether in current use, estimated number of gravestones, and remarks describing \r\nthe condition.

It is no \r\nlonger available in print and used copies start at $250 and go to $550. There \r\nhave been several attempts at electronic versions usually using Acrobat Reader. \r\nNEHGS released a CD-ROM version of the <em>Gazetteer</em> in 2003, and a new and \r\nimproved version will be available soon. This will be the only reasonably priced \r\nversion of this work. These volumes are a half-century of work on Hemenway's \r\npart to get local historians to write about each town in the state, a feat never \r\ndone before or ever repeated. Much of the history comes from the memories of the \r\nelders of the town who were either early settlers or the children of the \r\nsettlers. It is the type of work that is to be used wisely.

Each sketch starts with all information known on \r\neach head of household, followed by a list of all children - with their vital \r\nrecords -and grandchildren by name and a single vital record that connects them \r\n(I like to call this 2&#189; generations).

Each resident had to support the town church unless they had a \r\ncertificate from a minister saying the person was already supporting his own \r\nchurch. This is a list of the surviving certificates from across the state.

The earlier records are sparse as there was no requirement for \r\nthem to be recorded in the town books. Most persons warned out during this time \r\nwere poor and transient. Records for the second period contain more complete \r\ninformation, as the town clerk was required by law to record it. The people \r\nwarned out in the second period were not necessarily poor and most likely did \r\nnot move out of town. A person or family could only be warned out within the \r\nfirst year of moving to a town. Once established, they were citizens of that new \r\ntown. Many early settlers moved around a great deal, and this is one of the few \r\nrecords that help track these movements.<br><br>* Family Tree Maker, Family \r\nArchives CD #454, <em>Census Microfilm Records: Maine, New Hampshire, &amp; \r\nVermont, 1850</em> (Utah, 2000), five CD-ROMs. Though technically a federal \r\nrecord, this covers the entire state (plus two more states).

This is primarily due to the \r\ndifficulty involved with finding out what was published and whether \r\ncopies still exist today. This issue is now being addressed from a \r\nnational level to the benefit of genealogists and historians alike with a\r\n massive project called the <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.neh.gov/projects/usnp.html\">U.S. Newspaper\r\n Program</a>. Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the \r\nproject&#8217;s goal is to identify all newspapers ever published, microfilm \r\nall extant copies, and catalog them. The cataloged records are kept \r\nlocally and uploaded to the national database maintained by the <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.oclc.org/\">Online Computer Library Center \r\n(OCLC)</a>. OCLC is the most commonly used cataloging source for public \r\nand private libraries. Because this is a consortium project, the \r\nmicrofilms will be available to anyone at their local library through \r\ninter-library loan. The project includes all fifty states, the District \r\nof Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Vermont was the \r\nlast state to join, though as a small state, the project is already \r\nfinished. </p>\r\n<p>The &#8220;Vermont Newspapers Project&#8221; was a cooperative effort \r\nbetween the University of Vermont Libraries and the Vermont Department \r\nof Libraries &#8211; caretakers of the two largest collections of Vermont \r\nnewspapers. Staff members working on the project searched public and \r\nacademic libraries, historical societies, archives, publishers, and \r\nprivate collectors. Between 1994 and 2000 the effort led to the \r\nidentification of 900 Vermont newspapers and the microfilming of 260,000\r\n pages. The <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://vtnp.uvm.edu/\">Vermont \r\nNewspaper Project</a> website features a catalog of all known newspapers\r\n and a list of the 100 repositories in which the collections are kept. \r\nThe catalog can be searched by repository, by alphabetical list of \r\ntitles, or via a search engine that allows title, place, or Boolean \r\nkeyword searches. The official repository for the microfilms created by \r\nthe project is the Vermont State Law Library in Montpelier.</p>\r\n <p>A \r\nnewbie by settlement standards of the east coast, Vermont has an early \r\nhistory of printing. The oldest newspaper was the <em>Vermont Gazette</em>,\r\n published in Westminster from 1781 to 1783 by Alden, Spooner, &amp; \r\nGreen. Interestingly, the printing press used was the first one brought \r\nto the colonies from England in 1683. The oldest continuously published \r\nfamily-owned newspaper in the country is the <em>Rutland Herald</em>, \r\ncovering the entire state since 1794. Newspaper publishing was centered \r\nin four locations: Bennington, Brattleboro, Rutland, and Burlington. \r\nMost towns in Vermont had their own local newspapers by 1830, which \r\ncorresponds with the peak population of rural Vermont towns.</p>\r\n <p>The \r\n2000 census showed that Vermont&#8217;s ethnic population made up only two \r\npercent of the total. In terms of their newspapers, however, the \r\nimmigrant population was well represented over the past two centuries. \r\nThe first French-Canadian newspaper published in all of New England was <em>La\r\n R&#233;volution canadienne</em> from Burlington in 1838. <em>The North \r\nAmerican</em> was founded in Swanton in 1839 and sold throughout the \r\nstate. The lumber, marble, and granite industries attracted Italian, \r\nSlavic, Irish, Scottish, and Finnish immigrants to the state. By the \r\nturn of the twentieth century there were eight Italian-language \r\nnewspapers being published in Vermont. A brief history of the early \r\nnewspapers can be found in Clarence S. Brigham&#8217;s two-volume <em>History \r\nand Bibliography of American Newspapers 1690-1820</em> (American \r\nAntiquarian Society, 1947) [Z6951.B86 - Call numbers in brackets for \r\nthis volume and others to follow identify the location in the NEHGS \r\nlibrary. If they list &#8220;+ loan,&#8221; then members can borrow them from the \r\nNEHGS circulating library]. </p>\r\n <p>Before the advent of modern vital \r\nrecords laws in 1857, newspapers may have the only record of when and \r\nwhere a marriage or death took place. Obituaries (as opposed to death \r\nnotices) were an invention of the late nineteenth century. Prominent \r\ncitizens could receive detailed biographical write-ups that can help \r\nround out the story on your ancestor&#8217;s life. Scanning local newspapers \r\ncould reveal business enterprises or a local history event that included\r\n your family. Court and legal notices could uncover issues that explain \r\nwhy your ancestor was so hard to find. When a married couple separated \r\n(prior to legal divorce), the husband or wife (and sometimes both) would\r\n publish a notice of abandonment denying responsibility for the other&#8217;s \r\ndebts. Newspapers gathered news from all kinds of sources. There could \r\nbe a story about a fiftieth anniversary event that listed all the \r\nrelatives who came. Gossip columns often told who was visiting from out \r\nof town and if a local person went traveling. News items were commonly \r\nreprinted from other papers around the country. Local newspapers loved \r\nto print stories of native sons&#8217; exploits elsewhere.</p>\r\n <p>Access is \r\nthe main problem in using this valuable resource. The only online \r\nsources are for the modern period of newspapers. The <em>Burlington Free \r\nPress</em> and the <em>Rutland Herald</em> are the two largest newspapers \r\nin the state.

Men and women, single or married, could adopt. The \r\npurpose of adoption was to carry on succession, an occupation, or a \r\nfamily name. The first surviving written law regarding adoption is found\r\n in the <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm\">Code of Hammurabi</a> in the eighteenth century B.C. \r\nParagraphs 185 through 193 of the Code defined the parameters of such \r\nmatter in which the natural parents consented and released any claim to \r\nthe person. The person received the full and legal rights of a natural \r\nchild from his adoptive parents. If the adoptive parents subsequently \r\nhad a child of their own, the adopted person could be returned to his or\r\n her birth parents but would still stand to inherit a portion of the \r\nadoptive parents' estate. The exception to this law was that parental \r\nconsent was not required for the adoption of vestals, hierodules (temple\r\n slaves), certain palace officials, and slaves. Generally, the adopted \r\nperson was an adult. Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.) and Marcus \r\nAurelius (121-180) are two notable adopted children, and Moses was \r\nadopted by the Pharaoh's daughter.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>The Justinian Law of <em>The Institutes</em></strong><br>The Roman \r\nEmperor Justinian developed a new set of laws that were published as The\r\n Institutes in 535 A.D. Divided into four books, <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/535institutes.html\"><em>The Institutes</em></a> became the model for adoption in\r\n modern Europe. The eleventh section of the <em>Book of Persons</em>, \r\nwithin <em>The Institutes</em>, referenced adoption, saying that adoptees \r\nthat had not yet reached puberty could only be adopted if it was in \r\ntheir best interest. The Justinian law placed new restrictions on who \r\ncould adopt and how. Men who were castrated could not adopt. Women now \r\nneeded dispensation of the Emperor and the adoptive parents had to be 18\r\n years older than the adoptee. Adoptive siblings were treated as natural\r\n born and could not intermarry. The adoption was finalized in the court \r\nas a matter of law.<sup>2</sup><br><br><strong>English Adoption Origins</strong><br>The\r\n English did not follow the Code or Justinian law regarding adoption, \r\nand the Common Law of England did not address the issue. The British \r\npassed their first adoption law in 1926. Prior to that, English \r\nadoptions were handled privately with no record of the event. Poor Law \r\nguardians sometimes used \"Memorandum of Adoption\" that may survive in \r\nsome local archives. <sup>3</sup> Religious societies did not begin \r\nestablishing orphanages until the nineteenth and early twentieth \r\ncenturies. <sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>American Adoption Origins</strong><br>Adoption is defined in American \r\nlaw as the legal process pursuant to state statute in which a child's \r\nlegal rights and duties toward his natural parents are terminated and \r\nsimilar rights and duties toward his adoptive parents are substituted. \r\nThe procedure is entirely statutory and has no historical basis in \r\nCommon Law.<sup>5</sup> More simply put, adoption was the taking and \r\ntreating of a stranger as one's own child.<sup>6</sup> Vermont adopted \r\nthe Common Law of England on November 9, 1796.<sup>7<br></sup><br>The \r\nAmerican colonies handled adoption informally as was done in England. \r\nThe first law was passed by Massachusetts in 1851, and Vermont followed \r\nclosely behind, enacting its first adoption law in 1853. The legal \r\nbeginnings of adoption in Vermont started a half-century earlier.<sup>8</sup><br><br><strong>Early\r\n Adoption Laws in Vermont</strong><br>The taking in of a child was a private \r\nmatter in early Vermont. People sought out the law only when a child was\r\n reaching adulthood and would need a legal \"blessing\" to change the \r\nchild's name and become the adoptive parents' legal heir. The first \r\ndocumented case was that of William Fisher of Orwell.<sup>9</sup><br><br>When\r\n Abraham Wilson of Bennington deserted his young wife in 1788, the \r\nchildless William and Betsy Fisher privately agreed to raise one and \r\none-half year old Abraham Wilson. Fisher's petition to the General \r\nAssembly was accepted in 1804. This special act granted a legal name \r\nchange to Abraham Wilson, making him Abraham Fisher, the heir at law to \r\nWilliam Fisher \"unless Cut off by Will.\" This was the first official \r\nadoption recorded in Vermont.<sup>10</sup><br><br>The state passed three\r\n special acts in 1815 concerning the changing of names and granting of \r\ninheritance rights. None of the three acts covered the issues of custody\r\n or any obligations of the new parents.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<p>In 1822 the legislature created procedures allowing fathers to adopt \r\ntheir own children born out of wedlock without legislative action, as \r\nhad been previously required. The legislation only allowed for the right\r\n of inheritance and not for the changing of the child's name. The child \r\nconsented to this arrangement by declaring these intentions, having the \r\ndeclaration attested by three witnesses, and recording it with the judge\r\n of probate in the district where the father resided. The child had the \r\nright to decline such arrangement within one year after reaching his or \r\nher full age by going before the same court to renounce it. This action \r\nwould end the adoption.<sup>12</sup><br><br>From 1828 to 1849, no \r\ninheritance rights were granted. This process was restored to the \r\nprobate courts in 1841 and included changing the child's name. The time \r\nlimit that a child could revoke this arrangement upon adulthood kept \r\nchanging until 1862.<sup>13</sup><br><br><strong>Changes in the Law</strong><br>\"An\r\n act to provide for the adoption of persons and changes of name\" was \r\npassed by the legislature in 1853.<sup>14</sup> This law gave \r\nprospective adoptive parents another avenue for adoption beyond the \r\nspecial acts of legislation currently in use. The procedure was handled \r\nby the probate court. The law allowed for the adoption of a person, \r\nchild, or adult, by any single person, married couple, or married man \r\nwho was of full age and of sound mind. A married woman could not adopt \r\nwithout her husband, but single women were allowed to adopt at any time.\r\n The procedures of the new law were essentially the same as those \r\ncreated in 1822, except the action was handled in the probate district \r\nwhere the child resided, rather than in the district of the father's \r\nresidence. The consent of the child was required, regardless of the age,\r\n and the adoptive parents were required to publish an announcement of \r\nthe adoption in a local newspaper for three consecutive weeks. Judges \r\nwere required to report all adoptions and name changes to the Secretary \r\nof State on an annual basis. The statistics contained in these reports \r\nwere published with the legislative acts. There were only two adoptions \r\nrecorded from 1853 to 1862 under this law.<sup>15</sup><br><br><strong>Private\r\n vs. Public Adoptions</strong><br>Meanwhile, the private adoption system \r\ncontinued to operate. The number of private adoptions completed by \r\nspecial acts of the legislature grew dramatically in the beginning of \r\nthe Civil War After sixty such adoptions took place between 1860 to \r\n1863, the legislature decided it was an issue they needed to address.<sup>16</sup><br><br>The\r\n next adoption law passed in 1863. It was a reinstatement of the 1853 \r\nlaw with two additional provisions. The adopting person or persons had \r\nthe full power to decide whether or not to change the name of the child.\r\n The most crucial element of this law required that all adoptions must \r\nonly be made under the guidelines of the new law, thus eliminating the \r\nspecial acts that were becoming common. If the child was an orphan, the \r\nprobate court appointed a person to act as a guardian.<sup>17</sup><br><br><strong>The\r\n Sealing of Adoption Records</strong><br>At this point, adoption was a public\r\n matter and the cases were published in the newspapers of the day. The \r\nissue of accessibility to the records was not addressed, though these \r\nrecords were maintained by the probate courts. In the 1920s, social \r\nworkers began to advocate sealing all adoption records and placing them \r\nin the hands of agencies. The mores of the 1930s raised concerns about \r\nthe exposure of potentially embarrassing revelations, such as the \r\npregnant unwed mother, the adoptee viewed as a \"sin of the father,\" the \r\ninfertile couple, or the victim of incest or rape. Judges started to \r\nseal records on a case-by-case basis. In the late 1930s, New York sealed\r\n all adoption records, and other states followed suit in the 1940s and \r\n1950s. Vermont closed its adoption records in 1946.<sup>6</sup> \r\nOfficials felt it gave the adoptive parents a feeling of stability and \r\npermanence and encouraged mothers of unwanted children to choose \r\nadoption over abortion.<sup>19 </sup></p>\r\n<p>As mentioned above, the probate courts originated the adoption \r\nprocess starting in 1853. Family courts were established in 1990. They, \r\ntoo, can handle adoption cases for those persons already in their court \r\nfor other matters. The majority of adoption cases are still handled by \r\nthe probate courts.<sup>20</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Vermont Adoption Records: Where They Are and Who Can See Them<br></strong><a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://198.187.128.12/vermont/lpext.dll?f=templates&amp;fn=fs-main.htm&amp;2.0\">The Adoption Act (Title 15A)</a> is the main governance \r\nover adoption matters in the state since 1997. It states that all \r\nrecords are confidential and may not be inspected except as specified in\r\n the act. These records are retained permanently and are sealed from \r\ninspection for 99 years after the date of birth of the adoptee.<sup>21</sup>\r\n The <a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.state.vt.us/srs/adoption/registry.html\">Vermont Adoption Registry</a> (103 South Main Street, \r\nWaterbury, Vt., 05671-2401) was created in 1996. The Registry is part of\r\n the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services. It keeps a\r\n master index of all adoptions in Vermont from 1940 to the present. This\r\n index contains the adoptee's name before and after adoption; names and \r\naddresses of the birth and adoptive parents; the court and date that the\r\n consent or relinquishment was filed; the court and date that the \r\npetition was filed; any agency involved in the adoption; and the nature \r\nand date of the disposition of the petition.<br><br>The Registry is \r\nwhere disclosure of non-identifying information is processed and \r\nreferrals are given to support groups and search organizations. This \r\nlimited information can be released to the adoptive parents; the legal \r\ncustodian or guardian of the adoptee; an adoptee who has reached 18 \r\nyears of age; an emancipated adoptee; direct descendants of a deceased \r\nadoptee who has reached 18 years of age or their parent or guardian; and\r\n the adoptee's former parents, grandparents, or siblings (half or \r\nwhole). Medical and genetic issues may allow the Registry to release the\r\n information as well. Identifying information may also be given to an \r\nadoptee who has reached 18 years of age, emancipated adoptees, their \r\nadult direct descendants, or the parents or guardians of the same, as \r\ndirected in detail under the law. The former parents can also prevent \r\nthe disclosure of their information under this act.<br><br>The clerk of \r\nthe court can issue a certificate of adoption to the adoptee or the \r\nadoptive parents. It includes the date and place of the adoption, the \r\ndate of birth of the adoptee, and the name of each adoptive parent. The \r\noriginal birth certificates can be released to the adoptee upon request \r\nonce the adoptee has reached 18 years of age as outlined in the detail \r\nsection of the law mentioned above.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Private adoption agencies in Vermont (in 2002):</strong></p>\r\n<p><br>Adoption Centre Inc.<br>278 Pearl Street<br>Burlington, VT \r\n05401-8558<br>802-862-5855</p>\r\n<p>Adoption Resource Services, Inc.<br>1904 North Avenue<br>Burlington, \r\nVT 05401<br>802-863-5368</p>\r\n<p><a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.caseyfamilyservices.org/area_vermont.html\">Casey Family Services</a><br>7 Palmer Court<br>White River\r\n Jct., VT 05001-3323<br>802-649-1400</p>\r\n<p><a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.caseyfamilyservices.org/area_vermont.html\">Casey Family Services</a><br>60 South Main St.<br>Waterbury,\r\n VT 05676<br>802-244-1400</p>\r\n<p><a target=\"_new\" href=\"http://www.friendsinadoption.com/\">Friends in \r\nAdoption</a><br>44 South Street<br>P.O.

They were largely used for taxation \r\npurposes until the colonial period in America when they served to \r\nidentify able-bodied men for military service and later representation \r\nin government.&#160; Vermont was settled late in the colonial period and \r\nnever took any state census. New York, however, took a census in 1771, a\r\n time in which it claimed all of the area now known as Vermont. </p>\r\n <p>In\r\n 1771 the New York counties covering Vermont on the east were Gloucester\r\n in the north and Cumberland in the south. The western half of Vermont \r\nwas a part of Albany County. The New York census provided an age \r\ndistribution for both Gloucester and Cumberland counties. The heads of \r\nhousehold for the Gloucester County towns of Newbury, Thetford, \r\nMoretown, and Stafford were given separately. The towns of Barnet, \r\nRyegate, Lunenburg, and Guildhall were combined as one list. The vast \r\nmajority of the population lived in Cumberland County. This information \r\nwas published in <em>The Documentary History of the State of New-York</em>\r\n by E. B. O&#8217;Callaghan (Albany: Weed, Parsons &amp; Co., 1849-1851), 4: \r\n708-709 [F122/D63/1849 CD + rare book + loan]. <em>The Semi-Weekly Eagle</em>\r\n newspaper in Brattleboro published the heads of household for \r\nCumberland from January 17 to March 7, 1851. These were abstracted in a \r\nW.P.A. manuscript though thirty-two names were missed in the process. \r\nAll these names were included as part of <em>Vermont 1771 Census</em> by \r\nJay Mack Holbrook (Oxford, Mass.: Holbrook Research Institute, 1982) \r\n[F48.H7]. This lists people residing in Vermont from 1766 to 1775 from a\r\n variety of sources. The researcher needs to check the source for each \r\nentry to see if the name is included in the census of 1771. </p>\r\n <p>The \r\nUnited States decennial census (taken in the years ending in &#8220;0&#8221;) is \r\nmandated by Article I, Section 2, Part 3, of the U.S. Constitution that \r\nstated &#8220;[r]epresentatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among \r\nthe several States which may be included within this Union, according to\r\n their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the \r\nwhole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a \r\nterm of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all \r\nother persons.&#8221; The Fourteenth Amendment ratified in 1868 changed the \r\nlanguage to read &#8220;counting the whole number of person in each State, \r\nincluding Indians not tax.&#8221; The three-fifths compromise between the \r\nstates was the method used to count slaves. </p>\r\n <p>The marshals of the \r\nU.S. judicial districts carried out the enumeration through 1840. By \r\n1800, they reported to the Secretary of State. The Interior Department, \r\ncreated in 1849, assumed jurisdiction to 1900. Up to this point, the law\r\n created a temporary work force to count the people. Once the job was \r\nfinished, the group was dissolved. The Bureau of the Census was \r\nestablished as a permanent office by act of Congress on March 6, 1902. \r\nIts major function was to carry out the decennial enumeration. The law \r\nalso provided that the information collected by the Bureau from \r\nindividual persons, households, or establishments was to be kept \r\nstrictly confidential and used only for statistical purposes. </p>\r\n <p>Vermont\r\n researchers are fortunate that all federal censuses since 1790 have \r\nsurvived (except for the obvious gap in 1890). It should be noted that \r\nthe &#8220;1790&#8221; census for Vermont was actually taken on the first Monday in \r\nApril 1791, after it was admitted as the first new state. There is an \r\nongoing study of those covered in the 1791 census in <em>Vermont Families\r\n in 1791</em> by Scott Andrew Bartley (Vol. 1, Camden, Me.: Picton Press,\r\n 1992; Vol. 2, St. Albans, Vt.: Genealogical Society of Vermont, 1997). A\r\n third volume will likely be out in 2004 or 2005. [F48.V47 + loan] </p>\r\n <p>Vermont\r\n census indexes between 1791 and 1870 were published in book form. The \r\nfirst two &#8211; 1791 and 1800 &#8211;are full abstracts of the census. The 1850 \r\nbook is missing parts of the following towns: </p>\r\n <p>Grand Isle County &#8211;\r\n Isle La Mott, </p>\r\n <p>Rutland County &#8211; Clarendon, Mt. Holly Shrewsbury,\r\n Tinmouth </p>\r\n <p>Washington County &#8211; Barre, Berlin, Plainfield, Roxbury\r\n </p>\r\n <p>Windham County &#8211; Athens, Brattleboro (households 77/79 &#8211; \r\n583/667), Brookline, Newfane, Townshend, Stratton, Wardsboro </p>\r\n <p>Windsor\r\n County &#8211; Hartford, Norwich </p>\r\n <p>The 1860 book is missing all of \r\nAddison County. Vermont&#8217;s Special Schedule for Veterans taken as part of\r\n the 1890 census does survive and was published in book form. Online and\r\n CD versions of census indexes cover 1791 to 1930 &#8211; though not all years\r\n are available in a single place. </p>\r\n <p><em>Ancestry.com</em> was the \r\nfirst company to make all the images of the census available online. \r\nThey acquired the Accelerated Indexing data by Ronald Vern Jackson to \r\nlink index entries to the page images. The occasional problem of the \r\nwrong image linked to the census index can be overcome by searching \r\nfirst by state, then by county, then by town. Ancestry has the Vermont \r\nindexes from 1791 to 1890, as well as 1920 and 1930. The years 1860 \r\nthrough 1880, and 1930, include all name indexes (i.e. everyone in the \r\nhousehold, not just the head of household). <em>HeritageQuestOnline.com</em>\r\n is another paid service that has census images online, although their \r\nindexes only cover 1791 to 1820, 1860 to 1870, and 1900 to 1920. \r\nHeritageQuest created their indexes from scratch and these have proved \r\nto be better than Ancestry&#8217;s. They also have a more sophisticated search\r\n engine for their indexes. <em>Genealogy.com</em> has the following \r\nindexes and images available online for a fee: 1791 to 1820, 1860 to \r\n1870, and 1900 to 1910. CD-ROM indexes are available for 1791 to 1880, \r\n1900 (in Ancestry/Broderbund&#8217;s New England 1900 index), and 1920 from \r\nvarious vendors. The Family Tree Maker&#8217;s Family Archive CD for 1850 \r\n(which includes New Hampshire and Maine, too) has images of the original\r\n census linked to the index. This is the fastest way to access data for \r\nthis year. </p>\r\n <p>The closest census copy taken from the enumerators&#8217; \r\nnotes was the one given to the state of Vermont. These copies were never\r\n microfilmed and are only available at the State Law Library in \r\nMontpelier. They are not open for general browsing, but can be accessed \r\nunder special circumstances.&#160; In this version the enumerator for \r\nSpringfield and Baltimore noted the exact place of birth in most cases. \r\nInformation on these two towns were extracted from the state copy and \r\npublished as <em>Transcription of the state copy of the 1850 Federal \r\nCensus for Springfield and Baltimore, Vermont</em> (Boston: Scott Andrew \r\nBartley, 1993) [F59.S7.B38 + loan]. </p>\r\n <p>It is important to note that\r\n there is more to the census than the population statistics of which we \r\nare all most familiar. Statistical data was gathered starting in 1810. \r\nSome of this data might help with research that requires more in-depth \r\ninvestigation. The mortality schedules of 1850 to 1870 are a frequent \r\nhelp. The number of types of census forms expanded greatly in 1880. By \r\nthen, there were five schedules, seven supplemental schedules, and \r\ntwelve special schedules. Abstracts of criminal dockets, Justice&#8217;s \r\nreturn for statistics of court trials, and police department data were \r\nalso collected. </p>\r\n <p>The largest undertaking by the census took place\r\n in 1890, with four schedules, eight supplemental schedules, \r\ntwenty-seven special schedules, six special agent schedules, and thirty \r\nspecial schedules sent to businesses, cities, schools, courts, etc. Each\r\n of these topics could have several schedules. The total number of \r\nschedules for all topics is two hundred thirty-three. A fire in the \r\nCommerce Department Building on January 21, 1921 destroyed nearly all of\r\n the schedules &#8211; including all Vermont population schedules (though the \r\nVeteran schedules survive). </p>\r\n <p><strong>Number of schedules, 1790 to\r\n 1870 </strong></p>\r\n <p><strong><u>Topic</u>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress also ordered the \r\ndestruction of all non-population schedules from 1890 on since the \r\nstatistics were published. </p>\r\n <p>The 1900 census added some important \r\ngenealogical information. Month and year of birth is listed for each \r\nmember of the household. Each mother was asked how many children were \r\nborn to her and how many were living at the time of enumeration. Married\r\n couples were asked how many years they had been married (a question \r\nfirst asked in 1890). From 1910 through 1930 the questions were \r\nvirtually identical. The only notable differences are: month and year of\r\n birth dropped after 1900; naturalization year given in 1920; year of \r\nimmigration given in 1920 and 1930; number of years in marriages dropped\r\n after 1910; mother&#8217;s children information dropped after 1910; and age \r\nat first marriage given in 1930. </p>\r\n <p>Though the first six decades \r\nare just statistics beyond the head of householder&#8217;s name, they can \r\nprovide key information.

Noting a need for printers,\r\n the legislature voted brothers Judah Paddock Spooner and Alden Spooner \r\nto be appointed as the printers for the General Assembly in October of \r\n1778. The Spooner brothers resided at Dresden (now part of Hanover, \r\nN.H.), then in the jurisdiction of Vermont. By the 1790s, printers were \r\nestablished in the major towns of the state. The first volume dedicated \r\nto the subject of Vermont history was not printed in the state: Samuel \r\nWilliams's<em>The Natural and Civil History of Vermont</em><em>History of the Town of Middlebury, in the County of Addison, \r\nVermont: To which is Prefixed a Statistical and Historical Account of \r\nthe County</em></p>\r\n(Walpole, \r\nN.H., 1794). The earliest published Vermont town history was Samuel \r\nSwift's(Middlebury, Vt., 1859). The publisher, A. H. Copeland, \r\nwas responsible for most of the earliest histories that centered on \r\ntowns around Middlebury.<div id=\"paging\"><div class=\"page\"><p><font face=\"Arial\"><br>Abby Maria Hemenway is a name to \r\nremember in Vermont genealogy. She gathered the pieces that became <em>The\r\n Vermont Historical Gazetteer: A Magazine Embracing a History of Each \r\nTown</em>. As the publication's editor, her goal was to cover each county\r\n in alphabetical order. She enlisted the aid of local town historians to\r\n write sketches of each town. These sketches became longer as the \r\nproject continued. The histories often combined the collective memories \r\nof the oldest people in town with a survey of the earliest records. \r\nBecause many of the collaborators were of the second generation in the \r\ntown, the information gathered may not be found in any other source. \r\nThere are short genealogies randomly placed in each town sketch.<br><br>The\r\n publication of such a large project inherently has an interesting \r\nhistory. Volume one was published serially from 1860 to 1867. The rest \r\nof the volumes were printed as single volumes though many town sections \r\nwere issued as offprints. Volume five for Windham County was being \r\nedited while Hemenway was in Chicago, when most of the manuscript burned\r\n in a fire. Undaunted, she started the task of reassembling the \r\nsketches. She died in 1890 and her sister finished and published the \r\nvolume. Brattleboro was first sketch in the volume and had its own \r\npagination. Part two includes most of Windham County, though \r\nWestminster, between pages 560 and 669, is paginated 1 to 110. Part \r\nthree included Guildford, Londonderry, Wilmington, and Windham, all of \r\nWindham County, and added the towns of Sutton, Caledonia County (not \r\nincluded in contents) and Bennington, Bennington County. Each town had \r\nits own pagination. It is best to use the table of contents, located in \r\nthe back of many of the volumes, to locate a town. Volume six for \r\nWindsor County, the last in the series, had a dire end. Hemenway stated \r\nthat volume six \"was nearly prepared for press, one town printed,\" \r\n(Andover) when the manuscript fell victim to a fire in her sister's \r\nhouse. Hemenway died soon after and volume six was never published \r\nexcept for the Andover offprint. This is a great loss, but the Hemenway \r\nseries is still the first stop for researching families before 1850. The\r\n state realized the value of this resource and the five volumes were \r\nindexed under the direction of the State Librarian to create a volume \r\nsix in 1923.<br><br>Supported by the Genealogical Society of Vermont, \r\nScott Andrew Bartley's <em>Vermont Families in 1791</em> series consists \r\nof two volumes so far, with a third volume now in the works (2002). The \r\nproject hopes to identify everyone listed in the federal census of 1790 \r\n(taken in 1791 for Vermont). Each volume consists of a sampling of \r\nedited sketches by a variety of amateur and professional genealogists as\r\n well as others who were interested in the project. The families, towns,\r\n or counties are not being done in any order, but as the sketches come \r\nin. The project is large. There are 14,983 heads of households \r\nenumerated in the census. Volume one included 126 households and volume \r\ntwo included 107 households. Both volumes amount to 1.5 percent of the \r\ntotal. The coverage is actually much higher as each sketch covers the \r\nchildren of each household that are often already married and part of \r\nanother household. The grandchildren are listed when known.<br><br></font></p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial\"> </font><p><font face=\"Arial\">The focus of this article is\r\n to determine what Vermont town histories have been published, while \r\nlisting only the ones that include a genealogical section. The first \r\nplace to look for town histories is T. D. Seymour Bassett's <em>Vermont, A\r\n Bibliography of Its History</em> (Hanover, N.H., 1981, reprint 1983), \r\nwhich is volume four of <em>Bibliographies of New England History</em> \r\nseries. Additions can be found later in the series with volume eight \r\n(1989) and nine (1995). The best resource for genealogical content is \r\nVermontiana collector and bibliographer John A. Leppman's <em>A \r\nBibliography for Vermont Genealogy</em> (St. Albans, VT, 2000). There \r\nhave been several town histories published since Leppman's work and \r\nthese are covered in this article, which includes all published \r\nhistories to 2002.

Vermont's history is all about \r\npeople on the move, in search of that better life beyond the congestion of the \r\nbig cities and towns of southern New England. It is also about a political way \r\nof life. That, however, is a subject for another time. Let us turn our attention \r\nto the first settlements in Vermont.</p>\r\n<p>The Abenaki Indians, and other tribes, were the original Vermonters. The \r\nFrench had been visiting the region since 1609 but had not established a \r\npermanent settlement. Massachusetts granted lands in southern Vermont in 1716 \r\nand built a fort in the \"Great Meadows\" called Fort Dummer (now in the town of \r\nDummerston) in 1724. The French established themselves along the eastern shores \r\nof Lake Champlain in 1731. Vermont was still a frontier, with heavily forested \r\nlands, and far from the thriving ports on the coast or major rivers. Travel was \r\ndifficult, usually done on Indian trails or the frozen pathways of the winter's \r\nrivers and brooks. The first major settlement commenced in 1749 around the \r\nBennington area and the southernmost tier of towns nestled along the newly \r\ndefined Massachusetts border with New Hampshire established by King George II in \r\n1740. New Hampshire seized this opportunity and granted many towns to groups of \r\npeople called \"proprietors\" until 1754.</p>\r\n<p>The constant raids and uncertainty of the French and Indian War from 1755 to \r\n1763 almost completely stopped the flow of settlers. It was that war, however, \r\nthat brought news of the new land so green and unsettled and provided the \r\nimpetus to build several roads into the region. The first was the Crown Point \r\nRoad, which was constructed from the Fort at No. 4 (Charlestown, N.H.) and Crown \r\nPoint, N.Y., from 1759 to 1760. New Hampshire resumed its granting again until \r\n1764. The politics of the time created a major dispute between that state and \r\nNew York over legal claims to the land in present-day Vermont. The political \r\nwinds of the time sided with New York, but the migration to Vermont was already \r\nin full swing. Not even the actions of New York invalidating the New Hampshire \r\nGrants stemmed the tide.</p>\r\n<p>This migration was a multistage process. Families often lived for a short \r\nperiod of time in various communities along their way to Vermont. People poured \r\ninto the Grants, as they were known, coming up the Connecticut River valley on \r\nthe east. These settlers were generally from the east side of southern New \r\nEngland. People in southeastern Massachusetts would move through Rhode Island or \r\neastern Connecticut. They would make their way west to the Connecticut River \r\ntowns in northern Connecticut or western Massachusetts, called the \"Pioneer \r\nValley.\" This would be the launching point to their final destinations within \r\neastern Vermont. Immigrants from the Boston area and just north and west usually \r\nmoved into the heart of Worcester County or the northern fringe towns close to \r\nNew Hampshire. From there, they went directly west, again to the Connecticut \r\nRiver, or briefly settled in the towns of southwestern New Hampshire before \r\nmaking their way to the central and northern parts of eastern Vermont.</p>\r\n<p>Settlers also used the Hudson River to enter on the western side of the \r\nmountains. They often came from western regions of Connecticut and \r\nMassachusetts; others came to Vermont from the several counties above New York \r\nCity, where they had settled earlier. These settlers filled the counties of \r\nBennington and Addison, as well as the northern reaches around Burlington. A \r\nsmaller influx came from the \"Upper Valley\" region of New Hampshire, moving to \r\nthe Northeast Kingdom (basically Essex County).</p>\r\n<p>These migration patterns were the norm, but there were exceptions, as \r\nillustrated by the following examples. The Scots moved to Barnet and Ryegate in \r\nthe early 1770s. The Irish were in Vermont as early as 1774, though settled in \r\nearnest between 1816 and 1822 from Quebec City. The Quakers first settled in \r\nDanby in 1780. They soon spread into Ferrisburg, Starksboro, South Hero and \r\nother places from Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Nine Partners, N.Y. The \r\nfamilies of Ellsworth, N.H., moved en masse to Sharon, save five families that \r\nremained behind. My own ancestry provides another fascinating story.</p>\r\n<p>William<sup>4</sup> Olney and his wife Alice Dexter were living in \r\nSmithfield, R.I.. They took their family, including their adult children, up to \r\nSackville, New Brunswick, then in Nova Scotia, in 1761 when the British were \r\ntrying to repopulate the Acadian region with hearty New England stock. William \r\nand Alice both died there. The children began to have children of their own \r\nbefore many of them returned to New England, most by 1774. Their son Abraham and \r\nhis wife Esther Young were among them. Soon they joined the migration to \r\nVermont. They likely stopped somewhere in between but ended up in Springfield, \r\nVt., where many descendants now live. The records show that all of these \r\nchildren were born in Nova Scotia -- not a place most researchers would \r\nsuspect!</p>\r\n<p>The American Revolution was a turning point for migration. People moved about \r\nmuch more freely, and the flow of settlers increased. Vermont, some thought, \r\nwould become the most populated state. A case in point was Vergennes, \r\nestablished as a city in 1788. Another would not be designated for almost 100 \r\nyears. The irony here is that the city is no bigger now than it was 200 years \r\nago. The majority of Vermont towns, in fact, peaked in population between 1810 \r\nand 1830. French Canadians started moving south from Eastern Townships of \r\nQuebec, then called Canada East or Lower Canada. Their numbers swelled between \r\n1808 and 1820. Many of them were Catholic, but it was not uncommon to see them \r\nconvert to Methodism. The migration was sometimes disguised by name changes or \r\ncorruptions such as LeBrun, which became Brown, Beausoleil to Son, and so \r\non.</p>\r\n<p>Great changes were on the horizon. The newly independent state of Vermont was \r\nformed in 1777. With it was the first great out-migration. Loyalists from all \r\nover the colonies started moving to Quebec and Ontario between 1776 and 1783. \r\nVermont helped motivate this group by confiscating their land to support the \r\nstate treasury and its war effort. Few of them ever returned.</p>\r\n<p>After the war ended and peace across the borders was secured, the frontiers \r\nwere now safe for general pioneering. Vermonters answered that call in numbers \r\nlarger than those that came to Vermont a generation before them. People moved up \r\nthe Connecticut River valley through St. Johnsbury and into the Eastern \r\nTownships. Greater numbers headed through the valleys west and out of the state. \r\nOne diary often quoted made note that on a single winter's day in 1795, more \r\nthan 500 sleighs filled with families moving west came through Albany, N.Y. The \r\nNorthwest Territories was set up in 1787, drawing many there. The \"Genesee \r\nFever\" and other named massive exoduses called Vermonters to central New York, \r\nPennsylvania, and beyond. The first wave of Vermonters who settled upstate New \r\nYork along the Canadian border became the dominant group. Lake Champlain and the \r\nSaint Lawrence River were the \"roads\" to the Great Lakes region and settlement \r\nin Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>\r\n<p>Vermont history is truly one of migration. Its history shows it ballooning \r\nwith people eager to start a new life beyond the regimented ways in old New \r\nEngland. As soon as the balloon was filled, it was deflated with its people \r\npushing further into the new frontier. They came to Vermont for many reasons, \r\nand they left her for the very same ones!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Bibliography</strong> </p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Coddington, John Insley. \"Migration Trails.\" <em>Detroit Society for \r\nGenealogical Research Magazine</em> 35 (1972): 163-72. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Davenport, David Paul. \"The Yankee Settlement of New York, 1783-1820.\" \r\n<em>Genealogical Journal</em> 17 (1988-89): 63-88. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Dollarhide, William. <em>Map Guide to American Migration Routes, \r\n1735-1815</em>.

The first permanent settlement within present-day \r\nVermont was at Fort Dummer, now in Dummerston, near the province of \r\nMassachusetts Bay, by whose laws Vermont was then governed. King George settled \r\na long disagreement over the border between Massachusetts and New Hampshire in \r\n1740 -- the same border exists today. The king's decision placed Fort Dummer in \r\nthe province of New Hampshire. This province exercised its right to grant a \r\nnumber of towns for settlement.<br><br>Migration into Vermont was hindered by \r\nthe outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1755<sup>1</sup>. By the end of the \r\nwar, in 1760, there were only 17 towns along the southern border with \r\nMassachusetts and up the Connecticut River. Peace in the area brought another 63 \r\ntowns granted in 1761, nine in 1762, 37 in 1763, and only six in \r\n1764<sup>2</sup>. This activity brought to a head the border dispute with New \r\nYork. Then in the politic good graces with the crown, New York took its \r\ngrievance to the king. His Majesty ruled that this area, by will of the people \r\n(and not by any pre-existing charter) would best be served by the province of \r\nNew York. Unknown to the people, their case was argued in London. The decision \r\ncreated great tension between the settlers and the government of New \r\nYork<sup>3</sup>. It is here that I begin to outline the development of the \r\ncourts of Vermont.<br><br>The province of northern New York had no defined \r\nborders. With the king's pronouncement, all the land that would become \"Vermont\" \r\nfell within the jurisdiction of Albany County, whose seat of government was at \r\nAlbany. A year earlier, Lt. Gov. Colden recognized this was really New York's \r\nland and issued a proclamation that the judges and other civil authorities \r\nexercise control over the western banks of the Connecticut River. Petitions from \r\nthe area immediately followed, pointing out that one could not travel from the \r\nsettled banks of the Connecticut River without going through the province of \r\nMassachusetts! A meeting of the many appointed justices of the peace at \r\nRockingham in 1766 appointed constables for the towns<sup>4</sup>.<br><br>The \r\nfirst county erected in \"Vermont\" by the New York government was Cumberland \r\nCounty in 1766, with its seat of government at Chester. This county was \r\neliminated in 1767 and recreated with almost the same borders in 1768. The \r\ncounty of Gloucester was formed in 1770, being the northern half of eastern \r\n\"Vermont\" above the northern border of Cumberland County. Charlotte County was \r\nformed in 1772 and covered all of western \"Vermont\" except for the southern half \r\nof present-day Bennington County (which remained in old Albany county). These \r\njurisdictions were eliminated with the declaration of independence of Vermont on \r\n15 January 1777<sup>5</sup>.<br><br>These counties operated under New York law \r\n(not detailed here) for the brief time they cover. Their system was evidently \r\ninefficient or incapable. Gloucester County recorded 121 cases; however, only 18 \r\nreached any judgment. Most of the cases involved debt<sup>6</sup>. The original \r\nrecords for this area of the frontier are seemingly incomplete. What is known to \r\nexist is described as follows.<br><br>For Cumberland County, the surviving \r\noriginal records are at the Windham County Courthouse, Newfane. Some of the \r\nrecord books have been microfilmed. These records include the Court of General \r\nSessions of the Peace, 13 Sept. 1774 (3 pages); the Court of Common Pleas, 13 \r\nSept. to 16 Dec. 1774 (25 pages); and Vol. 1, Court of Common Pleas &amp; a \r\nCourt of General Sessions of the Peace, June 1772 to December 1773<sup>7</sup>. \r\nSome of the original case files exist, too<sup>8</sup>.<br><br>Gloucester \r\nCounty's surviving original records are just as scarce. They were kept for many \r\nyears at the Orange County Courthouse, Chelsea, but may be with the earliest \r\nrecords turned over to the General Services Center, Public Records Division at \r\nMiddlesex<sup>9</sup>. These records are contained on 20 leaves of paper. They \r\nhave been published in the <em>Proceedings of the Vermont Historical Society</em> \r\nfor the years 1923, 1924 and 1925 (Bellows Falls, Vt., 1926), pages 141 to 192, \r\nand reprinted as <em>The Upper Connecticut: Narratives of its Settlement and its \r\nPart in the American Revolution</em>, Vol. 2 (Montpelier, Vt. : Vermont \r\nHistorical Society, 1943), with the same pagination.<br><br>For Charlotte \r\nCounty, the surviving originals are with the New York State Library's \r\nManuscripts Division. What is extant here is the Court of General Sessions of \r\nthe Peace, Vol. 1, and the Court of Common Pleas, Vol. 1, both from 19 Oct. 1773 \r\nto 20 June 1775. The records for the county should have resided with Washington \r\nCounty, N.Y., and the remnant of the extinct county.<br><br>These New York \r\ncounties no longer exist. In the case of Cumberland and Gloucester, the counties \r\nset up by the independent country of Vermont assumed their jurisdictions. By \r\n1784, the remaining portion of Charlotte County was carved up and renamed, \r\nleaving these three names just a footnote in history. The story of the records \r\nsince 1777 begins here.<br><br>Vermont modeled its judicial system and state law \r\non Connecticut's<sup>10</sup>. Vermont's first constitution was established by \r\nconvention on 2 July 1777. It provided that the people had a right to trial by \r\njury, and that Courts of justice shall be established in every county. The \r\nSupreme Court and the several courts of common pleas shall have the usual powers \r\nof such courts and the power of chancery that are not inconsistent with this \r\nconstitution<sup>11</sup>.<br><br>A court system was already functioning on 17 \r\nMarch 1778, when the general assembly addressed the issue of providing attorneys \r\nand regulating fees<sup>12</sup>. From the end of the New York courts' sessions \r\nin June of 1775 to the legislation enacted by the general assembly in 1778, \r\nthere was effectively no legal court system in Vermont<sup>13</sup>. Temporary \r\ncourts were created by the assembly on 24 March 1778 with five judges for the \r\n\"shires\" of Newbury, Westminster, Bennington, and Rutland. The nature of these \r\ncourts was clarified on 5 June of that year and stated that these courts were \r\nnot county courts<sup>14</sup>. Later that year the following courts were \r\ncreated: \r\n</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Supreme Court of Judicature \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Court of Chancery \r\n</li>\r\n<li>County Court \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Probate Court \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Justices' Court \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Court of Confiscation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Part 2 of this article will explore the particulars concerning each of the \r\ncourts referred to above, with notes on changes through 1850.

The beginning of its court system was outlined in Chapter II, \r\nSection 4. It was simply stated that the \"Courts of justice shall be established \r\nin every county in this State.\" The judicial power of the State was vested in a \r\nunified judicial system composed of a \"Supreme Court, and the several courts of \r\ncommon pleas...\"<sup>1</sup>. This system evolved into three basic levels: \r\nSupreme Court; courts of original and general jurisdiction; and minor courts of \r\nlimited or special jurisdiction.</p>\r\n<p>The Supreme Court of Judicature was first called the Superior Court in the \r\nGeneral Assembly's enacting legislation on 23 October 1778<sup>2</sup>. The \r\ncourt held only one session in each half shire annually<sup>3</sup>. To clear up \r\nthe line of jurisdiction between the Superior Court and the county courts, \"an \r\nact defining and limiting the powers of the several courts within this State\" \r\nwas passed in 1782. According to this act, the county courts were continued \r\n(having been organized the year before), the Superior Court abolished, and the \r\nSupreme Court of Judicature established<sup>4</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>The Supreme Court is an appeals court only, for all practical purposes, in \r\nthe modern sense. By statute, it has exclusive jurisdiction of petitions that \r\ncannot be tried by jury. It may issue writs of error<sup>5</sup> to courts of \r\ninferior jurisdictions<sup>6</sup>. The court can also order a new trial in any \r\ncourt<sup>7</sup>. Historically, this court held jurisdiction over all criminal \r\nactions, which includes adultery, polygamy, treason, counterfeiting, forgery, \r\nperjury, incest, rapes, defaming of civil authority, and all other crimes for \r\nwhich the fine went to the state treasury. Each session, the court moved about \r\nthe state from one shire town (in other states known as the county seat) to \r\nanother<sup>8</sup>. </p>\r\n<p>The Court of Chancery was established by act on 3 March 1797; the Superior \r\n[now Supreme] Court operated as the chancery before this. It met at the same \r\ntime and place, and with the same officials, as the Supreme Court. This court \r\nwas considered to have all the same powers as its counterpart in England, as \r\nlong as these did not conflict with the Vermont constitution. This court was \r\nwhat is now termed a \"court of equity.\" Cases brought before this court were \r\ntried against justice that was deemed fair--the Supreme Court applied only the \r\nlaw as written. In 1839 the chancery was separated from the Supreme Court, and \r\none judge was selected to sit at the same time as the county court in each \r\ncounty. This court was in existence in 1857, but I have been unable to determine \r\nwhen it ceased. Present-day Vermont does not have a chancery; however, archaic \r\nlaws for it are still on the books<sup>9</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>The county court was first created in 1781. These courts evolved into the \r\nmodern district superior courts. This court has original and exclusive \r\njurisdiction of all original civil actions, except those that are admissible in \r\nthe justices' or municipal courts; petitions; and appellate jurisdiction of \r\ncivil or criminal causes appealable to this court. This court can also grant \r\nretrials (at the county level). The superior judge is designated by the \r\nlegislature to be the chancellor, in effect, making the county court the de \r\nfacto chancery court. Divorce cases are handled here. Appeals from this court go \r\ndirectly to the state supreme court<sup>10</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>The probate court was created by the General Assembly on 24 March 1778. It \r\ncreated probate districts and set the fees to be three times that established by \r\nConnecticut law<sup>11</sup>. Each county was to have four probate districts, to \r\nbe drawn up by committee<sup>12</sup>. Probate courts were established as \r\ncounties were created. (The west side of the Green Mountains was named \r\nBennington, and the east side was named Unity--changed to Cumberland four days \r\nlater--on 17 March 1778.)</p>\r\n<p>The probate court is the only court that does \"not proceed according to \r\ncommon law,\" but under the jurisdiction of statutes. An appeal of equity can go \r\nto the county court; however, a point of law goes directly to the Supreme Court. \r\nThe probate court has \"jurisdiction of the probate of wills, the settlement of \r\nestates, the appointment of guardians, and of the powers, duties and rights of \r\nguardians and wards.\" This includes all adoption cases and any land transfer by \r\ndescent<sup>13</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>The justices' court was the court run by the justice of the peace. It was \r\ndesigned to handle the day-to-day issues of a small, but legal nature. These \r\ncourts had the power to try all criminal actions that would result is a fine or \r\nforfeiture not exceeding 40s and corporal punishments not exceeding 10 stripes! \r\nAll civil actions went before the justices' court except those of defamation, \r\nreplevin, trespass, or where title of land was concerned<sup>14</sup>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Special Courts</strong><br>The first municipal court was created at the \r\nincorporation of the first city, Vergennes, in 1788. The mayor was selected as \r\nits judge. It is unclear whether he ever acted officially in this capacity. The \r\nnext municipal court was established at Burlington in 1865, with the head of the \r\ncourt being called a \"recorder.\" Similar courts were later set up in Barre, \r\nBellows Falls, Bennington, Brattleboro, Brighton, Montpelier, Rutland, St. \r\nAlbans, Springfield, and Winooski, and in the counties of Addison, Caledonia, \r\nand Orleans<sup>15</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>These fourteen courts had the same power as the justices' courts; however, \r\ntheir jurisdiction was greater. These courts covered their entire county, with a \r\ncouple of exceptions. If there were two courts in the county, each court had \r\njurisdiction in the entire county, except for the town where the other court was \r\nlocated. If a county had more than one probate district, this court covered only \r\nthe towns within its probate district. This meant that there were no municipal \r\ncourts in the counties of Grand Isle, Lamoille, and Orange<sup>16</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>A court of confiscation, one in each county, was authorized by the governor \r\nand council on 26 March 1778. Seven men were appointed as a court to confiscate \r\nand order the sale of estates belonging to the enemy. These men were actually \r\nthe governor and council themselves and were on the court within the county in \r\nwhich they resided. The General Assembly ratified this arrangement on 12 \r\nFebruary 1779<sup>17</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>This court operated throughout the Revolutionary War. Anyone deemed a \"Tory,\" \r\nthat is, loyal to the Crown of England, had his lands confiscated and sold to \r\nthe benefit of the state. The families usually moved to Boston, New York, or to \r\nCanada for the protection of the British Army. There are 152 known Tory cases in \r\nVermont, whether their title was from Vermont or a claim from New York. \r\nLoyalists petitioned the British Parliament for their losses. Between 1785 and \r\n1789, over 5000 cases were reviewed<sup>18</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>Circuit judges were instituted by an act that took effect in the fall of 1850 \r\nas a change to the judicial system. A Supreme Court of three judges was \r\nauthorized, the state was divided into four judicial circuits, and a circuit \r\njudge was appointed in each. It was his duty to preside in the county courts, \r\nthe Supreme Court judges having no duties to perform in the county courts; each \r\ncircuit judge was a chancellor, the Supreme Court having no jurisdiction in \r\nequity matters, except as a court of appeals. This act continued in force for \r\nseven years and was repealed by an act that took effect in \r\n1857<sup>19</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>Readers interested in this subject, or related ones, should review the works \r\ncited in the article and this list of additional works:</p>\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n<li>Billias, George Athen, ed. <em>Law and Authority in Colonial America</em> (New \r\nYork, 1965). \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Friedman, Lawrence M. <em>A History of American Law</em> (New York, 1973). \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Gorham, Alan. \"Federal Court Records Pertaining to Vermont: Sources for \r\nStudy,\" <em>Vermont History</em>.

It is not until the Revolutionary War that the researcher begins to \r\nbenefit from the records created by the military.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Revolutionary War</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Revolutionary War produced many types of records, some of which have been \r\nlost over time. They can be kept at the federal, state, county, or town level. \r\nThe lower two classes were militia records, which consist mainly of muster rolls \r\nfor a group of men raised for a specific alarm that was sent out. Realize that \r\nVermont was in a unique political situation; the Continental Congress considered \r\nit part of New York, but the state itself functioned like an independent \r\nrepublic. Even so, you will find records at both federal and state levels.</p>\r\n<p>The state records for the Revolutionary War were burned on 31 August 1945 \r\nwhen the State Arsenal was struck by lightning. Fortunately, it is believed that \r\nmost of the records destroyed were previously printed in <em>Rolls of the \r\nSoldiers in the Revolutionary War, 1775 to 1783</em> (John E. Goodrich, ed., \r\nRutland, Vt., 1904). Several books have supplemented these records and are \r\nmentioned in the bibliography at the end of this article.</p>\r\n<p>The federal records for Vermont focus on dispensation for service. The first \r\nround of compensation was for service in 1776. These are found in the state \r\npapers and are in response to disability claims filed by invalid officers and \r\nsoldiers or claims filed by widows for the death of their husband. The records \r\nmost sought are the pensions. There were several phases of pension offerings, \r\nmainly in 1789, 1818, 1832, 1836-1837, and 1853. Most of the early federal \r\nrecords were destroyed in the fires of 1800 and 1814, when the Capitol was \r\nburned. The large collection of records that survived have been microfilmed, \r\nindexed on microfilm (as well as in book and CD-ROM format), and abstracted in \r\nbook form.

The first \r\nbounty land act was passed in 1788 and the last in 1855. The federal land was \r\ngranted in the present state of Ohio. Soldiers could settle their land, sell it \r\nthemselves, or, under later acts, take the cash equivalent of its value. Most of \r\nthese files were destroyed when the Capitol was burned in 1814. The files that \r\nsurvived were interfiled with the pension files before microfilming.</p>\r\n<p>Another aspect to consider when searching in this time is the Loyalist \r\ncontingent. These were the people who remained loyal to the British Crown. After \r\nthe war, the Loyalists fled or were forced to leave the country. Most took \r\nrefuge in Canada and some sailed back to England. Vermont was no exception to \r\nthe rule. In fact, the state coffers were filled with the proceeds from the sale \r\nof land confiscated from \"Tories.\" The bibliography does not fully explore the \r\nsources for this type of material; however, you will find two references.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>War of 1812</strong></p>\r\n<p>The War of 1812 records for the state suffered the same fate as those from \r\nthe Revolutionary War; the muster rolls were published before the records were \r\nburned. I mention this war because it marks the start of excellent enlistment \r\nrecords on the federal level. If the soldier you are researching was a regular \r\nenlistment, and not from a state militia, he will have an entry that can include \r\nthe following information (sample entry):</p>\r\n<p>#1054 Lamphier (Lampfear, Lampfier, Lamphear), John; Pvt. 11USI; Capt. \r\nValentine R. Goodrich; 5'8\"; blue eyes; brown hair; light complexion; age 36; \r\ncooper; born in Connecticut (<em>Note: Most list town of birth</em>); enlisted 1 \r\n(or 24) June 1812 in Swanton for five years. (Source: \"Records of men enlisted \r\nin the U.S. Army prior to the peace establishment, May 17, 1815\" \r\n[microfilm])</p>\r\n<p>While these enlistment records have been microfilmed, the pension files have \r\nnot. An index to the pension files is listed in the bibliography below. The \r\noriginal records must be viewed in person at the National Archives and Records \r\nAdministration in Washington, D.C.</p>\r\n<p>Records from smaller wars and peacetime records are also available.

These \r\nrecords are easily found. Most of the federal records are at the National \r\nArchives. It is best to check one of the many research guides for them. The \r\ncollection of the original state records is part of the Records of the Adjutant \r\nand Inspector General's Office. The collection includes the Revolutionary War, \r\nWar of 1812, Vermont Militia (bulk 1838-1844), Civil War (bulk of entire \r\ncollection), Vermont National Guard, and the Spanish-American War.

These two actions established the \r\nprobate court in the state of Vermont. <strong><sup>[1] </sup></strong>The probate courts \r\nwere established as the counties were being created. The west side of the Green \r\nMountains was named Bennington and the east side named Unity (changed to \r\nCumberland four days later) on March 17, 1778. Each county was to have four \r\nprobate districts to be drawn up by committee. <strong><sup>[2] </sup></strong>The rapid \r\ncreation of new, geographically smaller counties led to new legislation that \r\ncalled for the establishment of no more than two probate courts per county. The \r\nsouthernmost counties (Addison, Bennington, Orange, Rutland, Windham, and \r\nWindsor) ended up with two districts of probate. All other counties had one. \r\nAddison reverted back to one probate district in 1962 and Orange did the same in \r\n1994. \r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p>The probate court is the only court that does &#8220;not proceed according to \r\ncommon law,&#8221; but under the jurisdiction of statutes. An appeal of equity can go \r\nto the county court; however, a point of law goes directly to the Supreme Court. \r\nThe probate court has &#8220;jurisdiction of the probate of wills, the settlement of \r\nestates, the appointment of guardians, and of the powers, duties, and rights of \r\nguardians and wards.&#8221; This includes all adoption cases and any land transfer by \r\ndescent. <strong><sup>[3] </sup></strong></p>\r\n<p>Estate records are broken down into two parts: testate (those with wills) and \r\nintestate (those without wills). Few people leave wills. It has been estimated \r\nthat only twenty-five percent of the population in the United States currently \r\nbenefits from testacy laws. The testate process starts when an interested party \r\n(usually the executor/executrix) files a petition for &#8220;letters testamentary,&#8221; \r\nproving to the court that the testator is deceased. This is followed by the \r\npresentation of the valid will. In some cases there are codicils to a will, \r\nwhich add to the will without invalidating it, as rewriting a will would do. \r\nWitnesses need to verify with the court that the signatures on the will are \r\nindeed theirs and that the testator signed the will without coercion. An \r\ninventory of the estate is taken and accounting of debts against the estate \r\nnoted. The decree of distribution, which identifies the recipients of items from \r\nthe estate, is the final document created. There will be receipts from the \r\npeople receiving parts of the estate. </p>\r\n<p>In an ideal situation, all of the above documents will survive. Most are \r\nconsidered valuable enough to be recorded in ledger books. These are the records \r\nmost likely to be microfilmed and used in genealogy research. The all-original \r\n&#8220;file&#8221; papers submitted to the court should be available as well. Things to \r\nconsider regarding wills: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You have to be an adult to write a will.<br><br></li>\r\n<li>In the state of Vermont, you must have three witnesses (most of the country \r\nonly requires two).<br><br></li>\r\n<li>A divorce or remarriage of the testator revokes any will written prior to \r\neither event. <br><br></li>\r\n<li>Present law dictates that wills must mention natural and adopted children, \r\ngrandchildren of deceased children, and the surviving spouse. That was not true \r\nin the recent past. For instance, wills before1950 would not need to follow this \r\nrule. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Intestate cases generally allow a surviving spouse to inherit a share for his \r\nor her lifetime only. His share is called a curtesy and hers a dower. The share \r\nis usually one-third of the estate unless there are no children and then it is \r\none-half of the estate. The principles of intestate distribution date back to \r\nthe Statute of Distribution of 1670, which states that descendants take first in \r\nintestacy estates (children, grandchildren, and/or great grandchildren). If no \r\ndescendants survive, then the court reaches out collaterally to siblings, \r\nnieces, and nephews. Also in the same affinity, but usually considered \r\nafterwards, are ancestors (i.e. parents, grandparents, etc.). The closest \r\naffinity bars others from taking any share of the estate. If a child survives, \r\nthen that child&#8217;s descendants do not take; if grandchildren survive, then \r\nsiblings do not take; and so on. If a descendant dies before the decedent, the \r\npredeceased person&#8217;s heirs take. </p>\r\n<p>Dividing up the interest in real estate is done by representation, either \r\n<em>per stirpes</em> or <em>per capita</em>. Vermont is a common law state that \r\nallows distribution by <em>per stirpes</em>, literally &#8220;by the root.&#8221; It means \r\nthat the share an heir receives is derived from the top, or root, and distilled \r\ndownward. Each &#8220;branch&#8221; of a family receives the same percentage to share among \r\nhowever many people are alive in that branch. The procedures closely follow \r\nthose of testacy cases and generate many of the same documents. The only \r\ndifference in older records is intestacy requires the court to determine who all \r\nthe heirs are, not just the ones that might be named in a will. </p>\r\n<p>It can be beneficial to be familiar with the legal terminology associated \r\nwith estate cases. The definitions below are interpretations from Henry Campbell \r\nBlack, <em>Black&#8217;s Law Dictionary</em> (St. Paul, Minn., 5<sup>th</sup> ed., 1979) \r\nand William M. McGovern Jr. and Sheldon F. Kurtz, <em>Wills, Trusts and Estates \r\nincluding taxation and future interests</em> (St. Paul, Minn., 2<sup>nd</sup> \r\ned., Hornbook Series, 2001). </p>\r\n<p><strong>Abatement</strong> The reduction of a devise in a will so that claims made \r\nagainst the estate can be paid. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Abuttals</strong> The land, highway, buildings, etc., that bound a piece of \r\nproperty. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Administration of estates</strong> The management of an intestate estate or of \r\na testate estate where there is no executor. This work is under the supervision \r\nof a court and includes collection of assets, payment of debts and/or claims \r\nagainst the estate, payment of taxes, and distribution of the remainder among \r\nthe heirs of the estate. There are many kinds of administrations. The most \r\ncommon are: </p>\r\n<blockquote><p><strong><em>cum testamento annexo</em></strong> (or <em>c.t.a.</em>) Literally, &#8220;with will \r\nannexed,&#8221; this is an estate that is managed by a court appointed administrator \r\nif the executor(s) named are declared incompetent, are deceased, or refuse to \r\nact.<br><strong><em>de bonis non</em> </strong>(or <em>d.b.n.</em>) An administration granted \r\nto a part of an estate not previously administered.&#160;&#160;&#160; <br><strong><em>de bonis non \r\ncum testmento</em></strong> (or <em>d.b.n.c.t.</em>) An administration of an estate \r\nwhere the executor dies, leaving part of the estate unadministered. \r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>Administrator</strong> A person appointed by the court to administer the real \r\nand/or personal estate of the decedent. If the person is named in a will, then \r\nthe administrator is called an executor. The feminine forms of these two terms \r\nare <em>administratix</em> and <em>executrix</em>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Administratrix</strong> <em>See Administrator</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Affinity</strong> The relationship, by degrees, between a person and their \r\nspouse&#8217;s blood relatives. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Agnation</strong> Relationship by the father&#8217;s side, normally through a male \r\nlineage </p>\r\n<p><strong>Ancillary</strong> A secondary intestate or testate case taken out in a \r\njurisdiction outside (i.e. another state or country) of where the decedent \r\nlived, and where the estate has assets or debts that need to be settled. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Beneficiary</strong> A person who benefits from the act of another by various \r\nlegal instruments such as a will or trust. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Bequest, bequeath</strong> A gift of person property in a will (now normally \r\ncalled a devise). </p>\r\n<p><strong>Chattel</strong> Personal and movable property not connected with any real \r\nestate. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Child</strong> One&#8217;s progeny or offspring </p>\r\n<p><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Illegitimate child</strong> A child born out of lawful wedlock. </p>\r\n<p><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Legitimate child</strong> A child born in lawful wedlock. </p>\r\n<p><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Natural child</strong> A child by birth as opposed to adoption or an \r\nillegitimate child who has been acknowledged by the father. </p>\r\n<p><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Posthumous child</strong> A child born after the death of the child&#8217;s \r\nnatural father. </p>\r\n<p><strong>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Quasi-posthumous child</strong> A civil law term for a child born during \r\nthe life of his grandfather or other male ascendant that was not his heir at the \r\ntime he made his will, but by the subsequent death of the child&#8217;s father is now \r\nan heir. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Codicil(lus)</strong> An instrument that modifies a will. Codicils must follow \r\nthe requirements of a will. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Common law</strong> The body of statutory and case law of England and the \r\ncolonies before the American Revolution as opposed to laws created by \r\nlegislative enactment. All states used a common law system except for Louisiana, \r\nwhich used Napoleonic law, a derivative of Roman law. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Court of Probate</strong> The court having jurisdiction over the probating of \r\nwills, granting of administrations, and supervising of the management and \r\ndistribution of estates in most states. Some states include the jurisdiction of \r\nguardianship over minor and adults. New York calls these Surrogate Courts. \r\nMaryland and Pennsylvania call them Orphans&#8217; Courts. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Decedent</strong> A deceased person, usually a recent event. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Deed</strong> In the United States, it usually means a written instrument that \r\ntransfers land. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Dower</strong> It is the one-third interest of a widow in her husband&#8217;s estate. \r\nA husband&#8217;s interest in his wife&#8217;s estate is called a curtesy. This is a life \r\ninterest, which is only having the use of the interest during the person&#8217;s life. \r\nIf there is no surviving issue of the couple, the interest may go to one-half in \r\nmost states. The dower principle is based in common law and now not used. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Dwelling house</strong> The domicile of a person as opposed to other houses \r\nthat may be on a single piece of land. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Easement</strong> The right of one landowner to use the land of another for a \r\nspecific reason, normally for access to the land from a highway or water. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Estate</strong> The property of a decedent. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Et al</em></strong> The abbreviated Latin term <em>et alii</em> meaning &#8220;and \r\nothers.&#8221; It is commonly seen in reference to buyers and sellers in land deeds. \r\nThe Anglicized plural form is <em>et als</em>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Executor</strong> A person or persons designated in a decedent&#8217;s will to \r\nexecute his or her wishes as written. The feminine form is <em>Executrix</em>. See \r\nAdministrator. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Executrix</strong> <em>See Executor</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Goods</strong> Movable personal property, usually referring to manufactured \r\nitems. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Goods and chattels</strong> This phrase as used in a will refers to all things \r\nexcept real estate. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Guardian</strong> A person appointed to take care of another person who is a \r\nminor or for several reasons unable to administer their own affairs. A guardian \r\nalso manages any property, rights, and money of the person in their care. The \r\ncourt appoints a guardian for minors up to fourteen years of age. Above that, \r\nthe minor can select his or her own. The age of majority (the age when one is no \r\nlonger considered a minor) was generally eighteen for females and twenty-one for \r\nmales. This applies to guardianships during and prior to the nineteenth century. \r\nA testamentary guardian is one appointed by a decedent in their will for their \r\nchild or children. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Guardian <em>ad litem</em></strong> A person appointed by the court for the \r\npurpose of prosecuting or defending the interests of a minor or other incapable \r\nperson. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Heir at law</strong> A common law right to the entire estate of an ancestor if \r\nhe/she died intestate. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Heirs of the body</strong> A child born of the decedent or one of the child&#8217;s \r\ndirect descendents. This specifically excludes a spouse, adopted children, and \r\ncollateral relations of the decedent. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Issue</strong> A term to include all offspring and lineal descendants of a \r\ncommon person. When used in a will, it was equivalent to &#8220;heirs of the body.&#8221; \r\nMore specifically, the intent was to exclude illegitimate children from a \r\nfather&#8217;s estate. Since the mid-twentieth century, the term has included adopted \r\nchildren, though its usage has declined. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Late</strong> This refers to a decedent, recently living but now dead. When \r\nreferenced to a residence (i.e., &#8220;late of&#8230; &#8220;), the term means &#8220;formerly.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Legatee</strong> A person receiving a legacy as stated in a will. A \r\n<em>residuary legatee</em> is one who receives all that remains in an estate, real \r\nor personal, by will after all debts and other legacies are paid. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Letters</strong> A probate court&#8217;s formal appointment of an administrator \r\n(<em>of administration</em>), executor (<em>testamentary</em>), or guardian (<em>of \r\nguardianship</em>).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Minor</strong> A child that has not reached the &#8220;age of majority,&#8221; of \r\ntwenty-one years old for males and eighteen years old for females (before the \r\ntwentieth century). </p>\r\n<p><strong>Natural Heirs</strong> This term is equivalent to &#8220;heirs of the body&#8221; or by \r\nconsanguinity (common ancestor), thereby excluding heirs by adoption or \r\ncollateral relationship. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Next-of-Kin</strong> This expression means those persons entitled to take an \r\nestate by statutory law, or more commonly, the nearest blood relations as \r\ndetermined by consanguinity. Historically this term described persons who took \r\npersonal property and &#8220;heirs&#8221; who inherited the real property. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Per capita</em></strong> This Latin term literally means &#8220;by the heads&#8221; or \r\npolls. This rule of distribution of intestacy is based at common law whereby the \r\ntotal number of heirs is determined and share equally, regardless of their \r\nrelationship to the decedent. </p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Per Stirpes</em></strong> A Latin term literally meaning &#8220;by roots.&#8221; This \r\nrule of distribution of intestacy is based at common law whereby each branch of \r\ndescent takes an equal share. Individuals in the same level and branch share \r\nequally, but not necessarily the same as in another branch or in a different \r\nlevel within the same branch. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Posthumous child</strong> A child born after the death of his or her father. \r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Probate</strong> The court procedure to prove a will is valid or invalid, \r\nthough now generally including administrations and guardianships, too. This \r\nvalidation is when the witnesses to the signing of the will appear in court \r\nswearing that the court possesses the will that they signed. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Progeny</strong> The offspring of a father, mother, or both. Generally it is \r\nconsidered to be all the children of a couple collectively, though <em>Black&#8217;s \r\nLaw Dictionary</em> does not define this term. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Relict</strong> The surviving person of a married couple. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Tenant</strong> A person who possesses lands. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Testator</strong> A person who legally executes a will. The feminine form is \r\n<em>testatrix</em>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Testatrix</strong> <em>See Testator</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Uxor</em></strong> A Latin term usually written as <em>et uxor</em> and meaning \r\n&#8220;and his wife.&#8221; The abbreviated form is <em>et ux</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Guardianship cases can be started by the estate process, whether testate or \r\nintestate. A guardian is needed to handle the estate &#8212; real or personal &#8212; that a \r\nminor child inherits. Historically, a living mother still needed a guardian for \r\nher children, which the court would appoint on behalf of the minor. This person \r\nis normally a closely related male relative. Children can request a specific \r\nperson once they reach the age of fourteen. Historically, guardianships ended \r\nfor females at age eighteen and boys at age twenty-one. Now they both end at age \r\neighteen. The guardian must submit yearly accountings of the estate held in \r\ntrust for any minors. Occasionally the guardian might have to sell land for the \r\nsupport of the child. This can only be done with the approval of the probate \r\njudge. </p>\r\n<p>Adoptions have been handled by the probate court starting in 1853 and \r\nexclusively by 1863. These records were closed by state statute in 1946. In 1997 \r\nthe state opened all adoption records over ninety-nine years old to any \r\nresearcher. For a more detailed discussion of adoption in Vermont, see my \r\nprevious article, &#8220;Adoption by Law.&#8221; </p>\r\n<p>The older probate record ledger or docket books have been microfilmed and are \r\navailable at the General Services and Records Center. These are arranged \r\nchronologically by district. Each county is one complete district or it forms \r\ntwo districts. These records were microfilmed up to 1850 and some cases to 1900. \r\nThey usually have an index in each volume. One resource that you cannot find \r\nanywhere else except at the probate court itself is the card index to the estate \r\nand guardianship records. These indexes vary all over, but most actually go to \r\nthe 1960s. Some of the indexes are closed as they contain cards for the adoption \r\ncases.

The services \r\nprovided here are outstanding and the organization of the records enables \r\nresearchers to find what they want quickly and efficiently. In addition to \r\nhaving the most open access to vital records in the country, this facility also \r\nkeeps probate records, county land records, town records, censuses, indices for \r\nnaturalizations and burial transmittals, military records, and much more. This \r\nis a &#8220;must-see&#8221; repository for all Vermont researchers!</p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><strong>Vital \r\nRecords<br></strong>Many of you who have been researching in Vermont may recall \r\nvisiting the &#8220;Roots Cellar&#8221; in Montpelier. That was the busy room filled with \r\nindex cards of vital records in rows and rows of filing cabinets. Those were the \r\ngood old days when you could check a variety of records quickly. Now these cards \r\nare on microfilm and the filing cabinets gone. While I miss the cards (you could \r\ncorrect misfiling that cannot be done on microfilm), Vermont researchers should \r\nfeel fortunate. These are the most open vital records in the country. By \r\ncontrast, imagine this: I recently traveled across the country to California to \r\nconduct research at the State Capitol. Once there I was told that the statewide \r\nindex to marriages (only found there) was no longer available to the public. \r\nRealize that the facility representing the most populous state in the union \r\nuntil recently had only one microfilm reader. The person at the counter did say \r\nthey could research it for me &#8211; although it would take two to three years! \r\n<p>Vermont&#8217;s vital record microfilms form the backbone of the \r\ncollections genealogists seek. They are actually a card file in alphabetical \r\norder broken down into year ranges: 1760 to 1870; 1871 to 1908; 1909 to 1941; \r\n1942 to 1954; 1955 to 1979; and annually from 1980 to 1997. There is another set \r\nof &#8220;revised, delayed, and amended&#8221; records. There is also a card index for \r\ndivorces covering 1861 to 1968 and then annually to 1997. Keep in mind that \r\nthese cards are only a secondary source copied by the town clerks (or county \r\nclerks in the case of divorce) to send into the state. The other large \r\ncollection there is the actual town record books (the original records) for all \r\nbut a few towns. These records are generally filmed up to 1850 or 1900, \r\ndepending on the town. This is always the preferred version of the vital record. \r\nThe town record books include town meeting proceedings and most importantly, the \r\ntax list, called the grand list in Vermont. These are annual taxation records \r\nthat were usually copied into the town books.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Probate Records<br></strong>Probate records are arranged chronologically by \r\ndistrict. Each county is one complete district or is divided into two districts. \r\nThese records were microfilmed up to 1850 and in some cases to 1900. One thing \r\nthat you cannot find anywhere else (except at the probate court itself) is the \r\ncard index to the estate and guardianship records. Most of these indexes go up \r\nto the 1960s, although it varies depending on the district. Some of the indexes \r\nare closed as they contain cards for adoption cases. Most probate docket books \r\nhave an index for that in each volume. The only great loss of records is the \r\nAddison District with a fire in 1852, although some records back to 1801 were \r\npreserved. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Land Records<br></strong>Land records are kept on the town level as are most \r\nrecords generated by the government. It should be noted however that <em>some</em> \r\nearly land records were registered at the county level, and subsequent sales of \r\nthis land continued to be recorded by the county. I have never been able to \r\ndetermine why the county kept land records. I would be interested to learn the \r\nreason if anyone has figured it out. Not every county kept the records, but the \r\nones that exist are kept at this facility. The following list shows everything \r\navailable on microfilm in the reference and research room. </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Addison Co. land deeds, 1784 &#8211; 1870, 7 volumes \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Addison Co. land deeds, index, 1774 &#8211; 1926 \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Bennington Co. land deeds, 1782 &#8211; 1832, 5 volumes (individually indexed) \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Bennington Co. land deeds, index, [1782 &#8211; 1891], volumes A &#8211; E \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Bennington Co. land deeds, index, 1891 &#8211; 1984, volumes F &#8211; I \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Caledonia Co. land deeds, 1796 &#8211; 1971, 6 volumes (includes Harris Gore \r\nproprietor&#8217;s records) \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Caledonia Co. land deeds, index, 1796 &#8211; 1971 \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Chittenden Co. land deeds, 1785 &#8211; 1970, 14 volumes \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Chittenden Co. land deeds, index, 1785 &#8211; 1944 (through v. 12) \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Cumberland Co. land deeds, 1766 &#8211; 1777, 2 volumes (individually indexed) \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Essex Co. land deeds, 1793 &#8211; 1971, 21 volumes \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Essex Co. land deeds, index, 1793 &#8211; 1871 \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Essex Co. land deeds, index, 1871-1971 \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Franklin Co. land deeds, 1797 &#8211; 1883, 7 volumes (individually indexed) \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Orange Co. land deeds, 1770 &#8211; 1781, 1 volume [no index] \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Orange Co. land deeds, 1789 &#8211; 1847, 2 volumes [no index] \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Orange Co. land deeds, 1771 &#8211; 1832, volumes A to I [note v.

The proprietors&#8217; records were the first records generated for \r\nany town. They are usually the minutes of meetings and the division of town land \r\nrecorded even before anyone settled in the town. The town meeting records were \r\nthe next records created by the town. At first, they included everything but \r\nland records in a single volume. Later they created separate volumes for tax \r\nrecords, vital records, and other specialized subjects. The land records were \r\nrecorded in separate volumes after the proprietors divided the land. There are \r\nnormally separate, filmed card files of grantors and grantees. Vital record \r\nvolumes appear by 1857, when the state mandated their collection, although \r\nseparate volumes were created for some towns prior to that. Allegedly there are \r\nseveral towns missing from the collection. I know that Fair Haven is one of \r\nthem. </p>\r\n<p><strong>WPA Surveys<br></strong>The Works Progress Administration (WPA) conducted \r\nextensive surveys of records in Vermont, which can help locate records moved to \r\nstorage at the state or county level.

I \r\nwill try to cover facilities from all parts of the state. The obvious one to \r\nstart with is the new Vermont History Center. </p>\r\n<p>The Vermont History Center is the new home of the <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.state.vt.us/vhs/library.htm\">Vermont Historical \r\nSociety&#8217;s </a>(VHS) library, <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.state.vt.us/vhs/barremap.htm\">located</a> at 60 Washington Street, Route 302, in Barre. VHS was \r\nfounded in 1838 by the Vermont legislature as an independent organization \r\n(though it also receives state aid). Its new building is the former Spaulding \r\nSchool, a historic building built in 1891 that overlooks the downtown area of \r\nBarre. Renovation began on the original structure in 2000 and the library on the \r\nsecond floor opened for business in July 2002. The updating of the interior \r\nspaces makes the library handicapped accessible. Some free on-street parking is \r\navailable next to the building. Entrance is free to Society members while others \r\nwill be charged a modest $5. </p>\r\n<p>The Society&#8217;s library is located on the second floor in \r\nspacious quarters &#8211; about triple the area the library had in its former home on \r\nState Street in Montpelier. The grandeur of days gone by is still apparent in \r\nthe library rooms, which have many period details such as American chestnut \r\nwainscoting, original pressed tin ceiling, and some stained glass windows. They \r\nalso have an integrated modern feel with functional furniture and working spaces \r\nfor staff and patrons. </p>\r\n<p>The first room you enter is the access point to all the \r\ncollections. The reference desk is here so you can reach it easily from any \r\nlibrary room. The card catalog can be found in this room as well. This catalog \r\nwas closed in 2000 and all new acquisitions are only found in the online version \r\nof the catalog, found on computer terminals next to the card catalog. The old \r\ncatalog is still a handy place to start. If you are interested in manuscripts, \r\nthe Brigham Index contains names and places found in the Brigham &#8220;Calendar \r\nSheets,&#8221; the old finding aids for the manuscript collection. If you elect to use \r\nthe online catalog, it does include all acquisitions since 1987. The word \r\n&#8220;online&#8221; may be a bit misleading. The electronic catalog is an in-house DOS \r\ncatalog system, though it will be converted when the funds become available. It \r\ncontains about 10,000 records. About two percent of the library&#8217;s manuscripts \r\nare found in the statewide online catalog called <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://arccat.uvm.edu/\">ARCCAT</a>. The call numbers for the \r\nbooks are classified by Dewey Decimal System, but are modified in the local \r\nhistory section to mimic the Library of Congress alphabetical arrangement of a \r\nstate&#8217;s town histories. </p>\r\n<p>The main library stack area is to the left of the reference \r\ndesk and catalogs. The library has the state&#8217;s largest collection of genealogies \r\nand local New England histories. Besides their own acquisitions, the library \r\nhosts the book collections of the Vermont chapters of the Colonial Dames and the \r\nDaughters of the American Revolution. Some years back, the Genealogical Society \r\nof Vermont (GSV) gave its collections to the library. The review books that GSV \r\nreceives are routinely donated here. With the additional open space and taller \r\nshelves, these various collections have been integrated into one. The first \r\nlevel of oversized books (the old &#8220;X&#8221; series) is also now intershelved. </p>\r\n<p>This main stack area has tables in the middle of the room. \r\nOff to one corner is a small meeting room and next to that are some private \r\nresearch carrels. The patron can find more research space in most every room. \r\nContinuing around the exterior of the building is a reference room for \r\nnon-genealogical material. The vertical and folio files are found here. The \r\ncomfy stuffed chairs by the windows are especially inviting to sit in and read. \r\nAny manuscript material that you request is delivered to this room. </p>\r\n<p>If you leave this room and go by the reference desk to the \r\nother side of the building, you will enter another library stack area. All \r\nnon-New England and non-genealogical periodicals are found here. VHS has started \r\na new collection of town reports from across the state, and they welcome \r\ndonations. If you have any that you do not need, let the library know. I will be \r\ndonating my long run of Springfield town reports to the cause. There are a \r\ncouple of carrels in this room, too. These are envisioned to be used by visiting \r\nscholars, as it is a quiet space. VHS is a member of the New England Regional \r\nFellowship Consortium that offers at least nine awards to one of sixteen \r\ncultural institutions in New England. </p>\r\n<p>In three rooms behind and to the left of the reference desk, \r\nyou will find computers with Internet access. The library has a small collection \r\nof genealogical CD-ROMs, mostly of census indexes to various states. There are \r\nabout twenty CD-ROMs of Broderbund data disks and the state&#8217;s new Historic \r\nPreservation &#8211; State Register of Historic Places CD-ROMs. Behind this room is \r\nanother that holds a small collection of microfilm. It may only be one cabinet, \r\nbut it holds the statewide Barbour Index to Connecticut vital records; the \r\nentire published and manuscript Vermont Historical Records Surveys done by the \r\nWork Projects Administration in the 1930s and early 1940s; an assortment of \r\nvarious Vermont church records; the Vosburgh Collection of New York church \r\nrecords (that includes some in Vermont); a newspaper clippings file; and many \r\nother interesting items. It is a collection that should be browsed. The last in \r\nthis series of small rooms holds a collection of oral history tapes and the \r\nequipment used to hear them. </p>\r\n<p>The room immediately behind the reference desk houses all the \r\ngraphics materials. VHS is known for its wonderful collection of photographs \r\ndocumenting life in the state since 1850. <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.thearchivalimage.com/\">The Archival \r\nImage</a>, a company in Brownsville, has teamed up with VHS to offer a \r\nselection of images from the VHS collection for sale to individuals. The \r\nlibrary&#8217;s large collection of stereographs is kept in this room as is an old \r\nlibrary card catalog unit containing a collection of postcards arranged \r\ngeographically. The room also houses a large flat drawer filing system for its \r\nmaps and broadside collections. </p>\r\n<p>The greatest improvement for VHS is one that patrons do not \r\nget to see &#8211; the manuscripts storage area. It is in the basement of the \r\nbuilding, though this basement is dry and not in a flood plain. The room is kept \r\nat a constant 60&#186;F and relative humidity of 30%. As a trained archivist, this is \r\nstate of the art. The material itself is housed in acid-free boxes of various \r\nsizes put on compact shelving. There is ample room in which to grow the \r\ncollection. There are few historical societies that can make that claim. The \r\nmanuscript collection includes personal and business papers, account books, \r\ndiaries, and many other types of material. VHS has a large collection of \r\nmaterial that relates to the Civil War. Much of it was identified in 1997 and an \r\nindex to that work is available <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.state.vt.us/vhs/civilw.htm\">online</a>. The more recently processed manuscripts have finding \r\naids, which serve as guides to the contents of each individual collection. </p>\r\n<p>VHS publishes books on many aspects of Vermont history. They \r\nalso maintain an online <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.state.vt.us/vhs/shop2/books.htm\">book store</a>, which includes many items they do not publish. Their \r\nMuseum Store at the History Center also sells books and gift items. In an effort \r\nto assist researchers who cannot visit the Vermont History Center, the Society \r\nprovides a <a target=\"new\" href=\"http://www.state.vt.us/vhs/genames.htm\">list of \r\nresearchers </a>that specialize in Vermont. I have not even touched upon the \r\nmuseum run by VHS, located at the Society&#8217;s former location in Montpelier. It \r\nwill soon expand to include the old library space and have a satellite space \r\nhere in the Vermont History Center. That is part of the future plans for the \r\nCenter. <br><br>I have only discussed the things you can find in the original \r\nbuilding that currently houses VHS. There was a large addition made to the \r\nschool in 1914 that is still under renovation. In short, it will include museum \r\nspace, an auditorium for lectures, and many meeting room spaces that can be used \r\nby other groups. </p>\r\n<p>So let&#8217;s recap here. The Vermont History Center is home to \r\nthe library of the Vermont Historical Society. Its collection is strong in New \r\nEngland local and family histories, scholarly journals for New England, and a \r\nlarge manuscript collection of original material. To put it in numbers: VHS has \r\nmore than 42,000 book and serials titles; 1200 linear feet of manuscripts; \r\n30,000 photographic images; 1000 maps; 8700 broadsides; not to mention CD-ROMs, \r\nmicrofilm, audio tapes, and the 20,000 artifacts in the museum collection. The \r\nVermont History Center is a first rate research facility, the best in the state \r\nfor non-governmental records. A visit here will surely be rewarding. </p>\r\n", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/vermont-research-facilities-part-1/", "published": "December 13, 2002", "id": 423}, {"author": "Scott Andrew Bartley ", "country": "Vermont", "title": "Vermont Research Facilities, Part Three", "content": "<p>The Bennington Museum traces its origins to 1876, when the \r\nBennington Historical Society was chartered, with aspirations to open a museum. \r\nThe museum itself opened in 1928.

Best \r\nknown for the largest public collection of Grandma Moses paintings and \r\nmemorabilia, it contains many more treasures within its walls.

Though it is not possible to \r\nknow the complete history of every object, scholarly research using historical \r\ndocuments and clues found during conservation allow us to better understand the \r\nobjects from the past and their place in history. The collections receiving the \r\nmost use (the Bennington Flag, the Cushman Furniture Company, and the parian \r\nceramic collection) have recently been researched by the museum itself. </p>\r\n<p><strong>The Historical Society </strong></p>\r\n<p>Another part of the museum is the Bennington Historical Society. The \r\nSociety&#8217;s goal is to gather information about Bennington&#8217;s past and share it \r\nwith the community.

Additional Society activities include conducting oral history \r\ninterviews and presiding over historical research projects. </p>\r\n<p><strong>The Genealogical Library </strong></p>\r\n<p>Of greatest interest to most of us is the Genealogy and History Library, \r\nwhich was greatly expanded in 2003. Its hours differ slightly from the museum \r\nitself &#8211; please refer to the end of this article for details. Entrance to the \r\nlibrary is free with paid admission to the museum. Museum librarian Tyler Resch \r\nand assistant librarian Bill Budde are always at the ready to help you. You may \r\nreach them via email at <a href=\"mailto:tresch@benningtonmuseum.org\">tresch@benningtonmuseum.org</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The recently renovated library holds the second largest genealogical \r\ncollection in the state, only behind the state&#8217;s historical society. The library \r\nboasts over 2,000 published genealogies on New England ancestry. It has complete \r\nruns of the major genealogical journals including the <em>New England Historical \r\nand Genealogical Register</em>. The <em>American Genealogical-Biographical \r\nIndex</em> (<em>AGBI</em>) is an early reference work based on the published \r\ncollections of the Godfrey Memorial Library, in Middletown, Connecticut.&#160; \r\nBennington has the complete set of over two hundred volumes. The massive \r\nInternational Genealogical Index from the LDS Church in fiche is another great \r\nresource found at the library. About half of the data included in the index is \r\nabstracted from published vital records books or culled from the microfilms of \r\noriginal town books. </p>\r\n<p>The collection&#8217;s focus is on New England and New York, with an extensive \r\ncollection of materials related to Vermont, including all published town \r\nhistories. It has the census index to 1850 for all seven states and local \r\nfederal census microfilm to 1930. Among the many town and county histories are \r\nthe Aldrich and Child series for Vermont and Hemenway&#8217;s <em>Vermont Historical \r\nGazetteer</em>. There is a collection of military histories up to the Civil War \r\nand military rosters up to the Korean War. The index and genealogical columns \r\nfor the <em>Boston Evening Transcript</em> and the <em>Hartford Times</em> are here, \r\nand the library&#8217;s collection of Bennington newspapers includes the <em>Journal of \r\nthe Times</em>,<em> </em>1828-29; <em>Vermont Gazette</em>, 1783&#8211;1850; <em>Bennington \r\nBanner</em>, 1841&#8211;1899; and a number of others. There are over one hundred \r\natlases, maps, and city directories, as well as the Massachusetts vital records \r\nto 1850 series. The library even has Vermont vital records on microfilm for 1760 \r\nto 1870 and 1871 to 1908. </p>\r\n<p>Many libraries can have the published material mentioned above. The unique \r\nvalue of a library is the manuscripts it holds. The collection focus here is for \r\nBennington County. Like many good libraries, it has a vertical file for local \r\nfamilies and the patron queries that have come in over the last fifty years. \r\nThere is a card index of thousands of early inhabitants of the area. There is a \r\ncard index to local cemeteries as well. The Day Papers consist of twenty-five \r\nscrapbooks of indexed newspaper clippings covering 1870 to 1916. The Harwood \r\nDiaries from 1805 to 1837 are also indexed and give a detailed view of farm life \r\nin Vermont. The library holds the original records for several local churches. \r\nThe Old First Church records even have a brief account of the Newent Society of \r\nNorwich, Connecticut, whose congregation came to this town and formed the \r\nCongregational Church in Bennington. There is a special photographic collection \r\nof New England covered bridges. </p>\r\n<p>Library patrons will find two microfilm readers. One has a laser printer \r\nattached. The library charges ten cents per image for photocopies and \r\ntwenty-five cents per copy from the digital printer attached to a \r\nreader-printer. The library accepts genealogical inquiries via regular mail or \r\ne-mail. With the latter, remember to include your mailing address. The response \r\nusually includes photocopies of records found. While there is no fee for this \r\nservice, I would strongly suggest making a donation to the library to ensure \r\nthis valuable service continues. Donations of money, books, or relevant \r\nmanuscripts would be a great support for this gem tucked away in the hillside \r\nnext to the Old Bennington Cemetery. If you have the opportunity to travel in \r\nthis area, the museum and library are well worth the visit. There is also a \r\nsmall store. The nearby Bennington Free Library has a local history room with a \r\ncollection similar to the museum&#8217;s library. Although the collection is not \r\ngenealogical in nature, it does include many local resources. </p>\r\n<p>The Bennington Genealogy and History Library is open in the winter and spring \r\non Thursday through Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., from November 1 to May 31. The \r\nsummer and fall times are Monday through Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., from June \r\n1 to October 31. </p>\r\n<p>The Bennington Museum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., November 1 through \r\nMay 31, and 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., June 1 thru October 31. It is closed Thanksgiving \r\nDay, Christmas and New Year&#8217;s Day).

Naturally \r\nthere are regions and time periods for which records are sparse, but Vermont's \r\npolicy on record access is genealogy-friendly. This article will focus on the \r\ngenealogist's favorite source - vital records. I will discuss record-keeping \r\npractices, legal developments, indexes, and related records. <br><br>Unlike the \r\nrest of the country, New England states in varying degrees have systematically \r\nmaintained records since the 1630s, with towns being the primary record \r\ncreators. Vermont provides one of the purest examples of this system. The town \r\nrecord is the original source. Genealogists need to keep this in mind when they \r\nencounter a problem with data. Because the statewide index exists, the original \r\nsources are often not consulted first. <br><br>The first Vermont law requiring \r\nregistration of vital records was passed in 1779, as described in the duties of \r\nthe town clerk<sup>1</sup> . However, this legislation does not seem to have \r\ncompelled people to register vital events. The most common record is for \r\nmarriages. In these early years, to about 1820, births and deaths were recorded \r\nin family groups and occasionally included the marriage of the parents as well. \r\nThese records were often recorded after all the children were born. For this \r\nreason they are less valued if there is a discrepancy with other contemporary \r\nsources, since many times they were recorded long after the fact. <br><br>In \r\nsome cases this \"drawback\" proves useful. For example, the oldest children of \r\nthe earliest families were often born in other states, and that information was \r\nrecorded in Vermont. This data then allows the researcher to trace a family's \r\nmigration, as in the following example: <br><br>John Smith married Jane Brown on \r\nFeb<sup>y</sup> 23<sup>rd</sup> in 1778 in Lancaster, Massachusetts <br>Jane \r\nSmith, their daughter born November 12, 1778 in Lancaster<br>Martha their \r\ndaughter born April 1<sup>st</sup> 1780 in Winchendon, Massachusetts<br>John \r\nBrown Smith, their son, born Oct<sup>r</sup> 18 1781 Winchendon. John B. died \r\nNov. 7, 1781<br>John Brown Smith born July 11, 1782 in Keene, State of New \r\nHampshire<br>Polly Smith born septem<sup>r</sup> 1785 in Rockingham<br>David \r\nSnow Smith january 28, 1789. Their son dieth Feb<sup>y</sup> 2.<br>Jane died \r\nfebruary 4 1789 in Rockingham.<br>Recorded this 9 th day of March 1789<br>By me \r\nJames Cooke T. clerk <br><br>This example shows a family moving rather quickly \r\nfrom Lancaster to Winchendon, Mass., and through Keene, N.H., before settling in \r\nRockingham, Vt., where the VRs were recorded all at once. Records such as this \r\nmight even be the only indication of a family's movement. This example also \r\nsuggests that the mother Jane had a miscarriage about 1784, because of the gap \r\nin birth dates, which normally occur at regular 1 to 1&#189; year intervals. Since \r\nthe deaths of children appear after their birth, the Jane at the end is likely \r\nthe mother, who died within a week of, and probably due to complications from, \r\nher last child's birth. <br><br>The volume of recorded vital records seems to \r\ndiminish greatly in the 1810s. At this time, there was a great out migration to \r\nNew York, Quebec and points beyond. Since the trend was to record one's family \r\nall at once, these families were never recorded in Vermont. <br><br>In Vermont, \r\nthe laws continued to require registration, though the language was much more \r\nvague as time passed.<sup>2</sup> Vital record registration as we think of it \r\ntoday started for Vermont in 1857. Each town clerk was required to transcribe \r\nannually, in June, all births, marriages and deaths occurring during the year \r\npreceding the first day of January. The town clerks were aided by the clerks of \r\nthe school districts, who were required to ascertain every February all births \r\nand deaths in their district for the same period.<sup>3</sup> These records are \r\nrecognized by the large folio ledger books, which are often arranged by school \r\ndistricts within the year. These oversized volumes were phased out by the end of \r\nthe century. <br><br>The next major change to affect genealogists is the 1919 \r\nlaw that gave the secretary of state the authority to require town clerks to \r\nmake a copy of all births, marriages, and deaths that are found \"in the \r\npossession of the town, and churches, not already returned, and to transmit the \r\nsame, properly certified, to the secretary of state...\"&#160; The state provided \r\nblank forms (color-coded index cards) to each town for this purpose: \r\n<br><br><em>If the death records of a town prior to 1870 are incomplete, the \r\nsecretary of state shall notify the selectmen of said town to that effect. The \r\nselectmen of such town shall, before October 1, 1919, cause to be coped at the \r\nexpense of the town under the direction of the secretary of state, the \r\ninscription on all gravestones in their town erected to the memory of any person \r\nwho died prior to 1870 - and the name of the cemetery where buried and shall \r\ncause such records to be recorded in the town records.</em><sup>4</sup><br><br>These card files (except the most current ten years<sup>5</sup>) are \r\nmaintained by the Vital Public Records Division of the General Services \r\nAdministration, presently located at Middlesex, Vt. The cards themselves were \r\nclosed in the early 1990s, but a microfilm copy of these files is available on \r\nlocation and at the New England Historic Genealogical Society in Boston, Mass. \r\nThey are broken down into the following time periods: 1760-1870, 1871-1908, \r\n1909-1941, 1942-1954, 1955-1979, then yearly starting in 1980. Each section is \r\nin a strict alphabetical order. Rarely are variant surname spellings (i.e., Cook \r\nand Cooke) interfiled. The majority of these records are open to anyone without \r\nrestriction.<sup>6</sup> <br><br>Because most researchers will go first to this \r\nstatewide vital records index, a few words of caution will keep the wary \r\ngenealogist on track when things seem wrong. The index is a transcription of the \r\noriginal record, and thus errors sometimes appear, such as misspellings and \r\nincorrect dates. Moreover, some events from the town record could be missing. \r\nBesides the strict alphabetical sequence, if a given name was not recorded, \r\nthese cards were filed in the beginning of the surname under \"no name,\" \"Mr.,\" \r\n\"widow,\" and the like, in reverse chronological order. Cemetery inscriptions of \r\ndeaths are contained in the first time period only. Cards recording events in \r\nthe cusp years of 1870 / 1871 and 1908 / 1909 are occasionally misfiled. Most of \r\nthese cards were filmed in the 1950s, some in the 1990s, after being used for \r\nmany years. There are cards out of alphabetical order, though rarely far from \r\ntheir correct placement. A researcher can never systematically find these \r\nmisfiled cards, but s/he should be aware of this problem. The pre-1871 events \r\nare known to have records missing from the towns of Holland, Maidstone, \r\nSheffield, and Troy. It has been suggested that some of the Burlington records \r\nfrom the 1860s and 1870s were missed, too. As a last resort, if you cannot find \r\na record (especially before 1820 or after 1856) that other sources suggest is \r\nthere, go back to the <em>original</em> town records.<sup>7</sup><br><br>Related \r\nrecords that genealogists may want to use are the divorce files. There is a \r\nstatewide index from 1861 to 1968, which is cross-indexed by both husband and \r\nwife. These indexes are available at the same locations as the vital records \r\nindex. The original files are kept by the county court in the shire \r\ntowns.<sup>8</sup>Another, more difficult, source, though less so in Vermont \r\nthan any other state, is adoption records. Adoption was largely a private affair \r\nthat involved little legal intervention. The first case to be made 'legal' was \r\nin 1804, though the state formally codified adoption procedures only in 1853, \r\ntwo years after Massachusetts, the first American state to do so, as an \r\nalternative method to private, unrecorded adoption. By 1863, the legislature \r\nmandated the new procedure. Before this, any cases made legal by action of the \r\nGeneral Assembly usually contained a brief history of the child.<sup>9</sup> \r\nVermont's new access provides that adoption records be open to the public after \r\n99 years.<br><br>The Vermont Adoption Registry maintains a master index of all \r\nadoptions from 1940 to the present. In certain situations, the Registry can \r\nprovide 'identifying information' to adult adoptees or adult descendants of an \r\nadoptee. The Registry is located at 103 South Main Street, Waterbury VT \r\n05671-2401, or by calling 802- 241-2122.<sup>10</sup> <br><br>To find out the \r\ncurrent cost and location of vital records, check the web site <a href=\"http://vitalrec.com/vt.html\" target=\"_new\">here</a> or to search the Vermont \r\nstate death index for 1989 to 1996 as a paid service, <a href=\"http://www.ancestry.com/ancestry/search/3269.htm\" target=\"_new\">here.</a><br><br><strong>Footnotes</strong> </p>\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>\"17 Feb. 1779: An Act Directing Town Clerks in their Office and Duty.

However, most genealogists look to England for the origins of early \r\nNew England ways. Local authorities in England were given the right to expel \r\nundesirables in 1495 and defined what a legal settlement was in the Poor Law of \r\n1530. The Acts of 1597, 1601, and 1662 refined these laws. Plymouth Colony and \r\nMassachusetts Bay grappled with the same issues immediately after settlement \r\nbegan. Religion was often the issue that started any action, but the issue of \r\nhandling the town's poor eventually encouraged the frequent use of warnings \r\nout.<br><br>Vermont's actions were influenced by the combined experience of the \r\nother New England states. As it was the last state of New England to be settled, \r\nsome issues in the system had already been worked out. English common law was \r\nthe rule of the land. Vermont's own brand of governance was based on \r\nConnecticut's laws of 1769, which contained the strictest inhabitancy laws of \r\nthe states. The first decision in Vermont came at the local level with the \r\nvoters of Rockingham agreeing that \"all Strangers who Com to Inhabit in said \r\ntown Not being Freeholders, be warned out of town\" in 1769. The newly formed \r\nindependent state of Vermont took up the matter in the second year of its \r\nconstitution.<br><br>Focusing on the financial welfare of the towns, the Vermont \r\nGeneral Assembly passed two laws on 15 February 1779 dealing with the poor and \r\ntransients. These acts were declared temporary and in force only \"until the \r\nrising of the General Assembly in October next.\" These laws were revived first \r\nsemi-annually and then annually in October for several years. The first was \r\nentitled \"An Act for the Ordering and Disposing of Transient Persons\" and stated \r\nin part: </p>\r\n<div class=\"page\"><p><em>&#8230; the selectmen of each respective town in this state, shall be and are \r\nhereby authorized and impowered to warn any transient person (residing in such \r\ntown that is not of a quiet and peaceable behaviour, or is in their opinion like \r\nto be chargeable to such town) to depart out of such town, except such person \r\ndoes obtain a vote of the inhabitants of such town in legal town meeting, to \r\nremain in such town; and if any such person or persons being so warned, do not \r\nleave such town within twenty days after such warning, then one or more of said \r\nselectmen may make application to an assistant or justice of the peace, who is \r\nhereby impowered to issue his warrant to the sheriff or constable to take such \r\nperson or persons, and transport him or them, to the next town towards the place \r\nwhere such person was last an inhabitant, in the same manner to be transported \r\nto the place where such person or persons were inhabitants last, or in the same \r\nway out of this state, if he be not an inhabitant thereof; and all such expence \r\nshall be paid by the person or persons so warned, if of ability, but if he is \r\nnot of ability, to be paid by such town. Provided always that no person shall be \r\nsubject to such warning, after he or she has lived in such town one \r\nyear.</em></p>\r\n<p>The second was entitled \"An Act for Maintaining and Supporting the Poor\" and \r\nstated in part: </p>\r\n<p><em>&#8230; that each town in this state shall take care of, support, and maintain \r\ntheir own poor. And the selectmen for the time being, or overseers of the poor \r\n(where any such are chosen), shall have full power to expend or disburse, out of \r\nthe town stock, or treasury, what they shall judge necessary from time to time, \r\nfor the relief and support of any of the poor belonging to their towns, so far \r\nas to the amount of ten pounds; and if more be needful, the said selectmen, or \r\noverseers, or the major part of them, shall, with the advice of the authority of \r\nthat town (if any there be), expend and disburse what shall be by them judged \r\nneedful for the relief of the poor, as aforesaid.<br><br>&#8230; supplying them, or \r\nany of them, with victuals, clothing, firewood, or any other thing necessary for \r\ntheir support or subsistence.<br><br>That if any poor person or persons, who \r\nhave had, or shall have relief or supplies from any town, shall suffer their \r\nchildren to live idly, or misspend their time in loitering, and neglect to bring \r\nthem up or employ them in some honest calling, which may be profitable to \r\nthemselves and the public; or if there shall be at any time any family that \r\ncannot or do not provide competently for their children, whereby they are \r\nexposed to want, or extremity; or if there be any poor children in any town, \r\nbelonging to such town, that live idly, or are exposed to want and distress, and \r\nthere are none to take care of them, it shall and may be lawful for the \r\nselectmen, or overseers of the poor, in each town, and they are hereby impowered \r\nand directed, with the assent of the next assistant or justice of the peace, to \r\nbind out any and every such poor child or children, belonging to such town, to \r\nbe apprentices, or servants, where they shall see convenient, a male child, till \r\nhe comes to twenty-one years of age, and a female, till she comes to the age of \r\neighteen year: which binding shall as effectual, to all intents and purposes, as \r\nif any child were of full age, and by indenture of covenant had bound him or \r\nherself.<br><br>And that if any person or persons shall come to live in any town \r\nin this state, and be there received and entertained, by the space of twelve \r\nmonths; and if by sickness, lameness, or the like, he or they come to want \r\nrelief, every such person or persons shall be provided for by that town wherein \r\nhe or they were so long entertained, at said town's own proper cost and charge, \r\nunless such person or persons, wanting relief, have, within the said twelve \r\nmonths, been warned as the law directs, to depart and leave the place; and if \r\nsuch warning be given, and the same be certified to the next superior court to \r\nbe held in the same county, the said court shall and may otherwise order the \r\ndefraying the charge arising about such indigent person or persons.</em></p>\r\n<p>The General Assembly journals note the passage of \"An Act for the admission \r\nof inhabitants in towns and for preventing of change by such as are admitted \r\ntherein.\" This likely defined the parameters for legal settlement within a \r\nVermont town. No published version of this act has been found in the standard \r\nlegal reference works. <br><br>The law regarding warnings out was established \r\nthe same day with the passage of \"An Act for the ordering and disposing of \r\ntransient persons.\" However, while the act never specifically defined the \r\ncharacteristics of said \"transient persons,\" it was clear that only persons \r\njudged to be transient (basically, those who appeared poor or suspicious) would \r\nreceive warnings out. If the newcomer managed to stay undetected in town for a \r\nyear, that person would be able to legally settle in the town. The act also \r\nnever prescribed how or where these warnings were to be recorded, but it has \r\nbeen speculated that some may be recorded in the county court records. \r\n<br><br>The following day, \"An Act for relieving and ordering idiots, impotent, \r\ndistracted and idle persons\" was passed that affected the poor. Briefly, if a \r\nperson became poor and had no estate, it was the responsibility of his or her \r\nrelatives to support them in order of father or mother, grandfather or \r\ngrandmother, children or grandchildren. If no relatives were found, the town \r\nwould be charged with the support for that person. If they owned real estate, \r\nthe selectmen of their town could petition the General Assembly to sell the \r\nproperty for the benefit of their support. The selectmen could also appoint an \r\noverseer \"to advise, direct, and order such persons in the management of their \r\nbusiness\" for as long as needed and the person could not bargain or contract \r\nwithout consent of the overseer. It was further defined that a grandchild was \r\nnot obligated to support a grandparent unless the grandchild received the \r\ngrandparent's estate. <br><br>In 1787, a lengthy act clarified the state's \r\nposition on transient, idle, impotent, or poor persons. The act stated \"That no \r\nperson shall gain a settlement in any town in this State, and be liable to be \r\nsupported thereby, unless such person was born therein, or has owned, or shall \r\nown, Estate in such town of the value of two hundred pounds, clear of all \r\nDemands against him or her, or of the yearly value of ten pounds.\" Furthermore, \r\nany person not having a settlement in a town became chargeable. A Justice of the \r\nPeace could have the person removed to the place of the person's legal \r\nsettlement within the state. If the person was not a resident of the state, he \r\nor she would be transported out of state on the direct route to the person's \r\nplace of residence. This marked the end of Vermont's warning out practices in \r\nthe 18th Century, with most states following suit by the 1790s. The only towns \r\nwith warning out records from this period are Athens, Barnet, Bennington, \r\nBrattleboro, Brookfield, Danby, Dorset, Grafton, Guilford, Ira, Marlboro, \r\nNewbury, Peacham, Pittsford, Putney, Reading, Rockingham, Shaftsbury, \r\nShrewsbury, Townshend, Weathersfield, Westminster, Wilmington, Windsor, and \r\nWoodstock. Bennington and Putney had the most extensive records.<br><br>New \r\nrequirements for settlement were defined by a law passed on 3 March 1797 as part \r\nof the laws regarding the care for the poor. Legal settlement could be obtained \r\nthrough a variety of means including any one of the following: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Buying land of $100 in value or more and living on it for more than one year \r\n\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Rent and occupy a tenement for $20 per year for more than two years \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Hold public office for one year \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Pay public taxes for two years \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Be an apprentice or indentured person for three years prior to a male \r\nreaching 21 years of age or a female reaching 18 years of age </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The law also stated, \"Every other healthy, able-bodied person residing within \r\nthis state and being of peaceable behavior shall also be judged to be legally \r\nsettled in the town. Every bastard child shall be settled in the town of his or \r\nher mother's last legal settlement.\" This 1797 law was repealed by an act on 6 \r\nNovember 1801.<br><br>On this date, Vermont became the only state to revive the \r\nwarning out system. The chapter devoted to legal settlement and providing for \r\nthe poor had an addition to \"An Act defining what shall be deemed and adjudged a \r\nlegal settlement, and for the support of the poor; for designating the duties \r\nand powers of the overseers of the poor; and for the punishment of idle and \r\ndisorderly persons.\" This gave the local selectmen the authority to warn out \r\nanyone arriving in their town at their discretion. The law prescribed exactly \r\nhow the warning was to be worded, served, and recorded in the town books. If \r\nsomeone was warned, they could never gain legal settlement in the town except by \r\na vote at town meeting. If a person was not warned within one year from arriving \r\nin town, then the person was officially granted legal settlement. Another way \r\nwas to take up town service for a year as selectman, town clerk, constable, \r\ngrand juror, or lister (person appointed to make a list of taxable residents) to \r\nobtain legal settlement. If a warned person returned, they were subject to \r\npublic whipping.<br><br>This pivotal law transferred the power of controlling \r\nsettlement to the selectmen. They could warn out everyone should they feel \r\ninclined, and in some towns this was the approach that was taken. If the \r\nselectmen warned out everyone, they would not have to worry about being \r\nresponsible for people who may later become reliant on town funds to assist \r\nthem. The most warning out records were in Andover, Brattleboro, Burlington, \r\nGuilford, Montpelier, Norwich, Putney, Rockingham, Springfield, Weathersfield, \r\nand Westminster. Other towns seem to have followed the former reasoning and only \r\nwarned out likely transient and poor people who may have become a burden on the \r\ntown funds. It should be noted that, in practice, few people warned out were \r\nforcibly removed in this second phase of the system. By law, those warned were \r\nforever disqualified from financial assistance anyway, so the selectmen merely \r\nhad to give their warnings and look the other way.<br><br>Lawsuits regarding the \r\nwarning out process were in the courts. The warning out process ended by law on \r\n4 November 1817. The new ways to gain legal settlement were codified as: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A married woman shall always have the settlement of her husband. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Legitimate children shall have the settlement of their parents. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Illegitimate children shall have the settlement of their mother. The \r\nchildren of parents who have no legal settlement shall not gain a settlement by \r\nbirth in the town. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Every person of full age who shall have an estate taxed at $60 or above to \r\nfive consecutive years shall gain legal settlement. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Any person serving two years as town clerk, selectman, overseer of the poor, \r\ntreasurer, lister, constable, or grand juror shall gain legal settlement. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Any person being voted in at a town meeting for that purpose shall gain \r\nlegal settlement. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Anyone residing within the state for one full year and being in an \r\nunorganized town shall gain legal settlement upon the organization of the town. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>Any person having settlement in any town in this state, of full age, for \r\nseven years shall gain legal settlement in any town in the state that such \r\nperson desires. \r\n</li>\r\n<li>No person shall have a settlement in any town as above without the previous \r\ntown clerk having recorded it in a book for such registry. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Town clerks soon learned of this law and only a few entries for warning out \r\nwere recorded in 1818.<br><br>The Works in Progress Administration made \r\ninventories of town records. A few of the reports were published in the early \r\n1940s, but all others were in manuscript form. Alden M. Rollins reviewed these \r\nrecords before abstracting the warning out records themselves in his two-volume \r\nset <em>Vermont Warnings Out</em> (Vol 1, 1995; Vol 2, 1997, Picton Press). </p>\r\n<p>He found the following towns did not have warning out records in the WPA \r\ninventories: </p>\r\n<p>Granville, Addison Co.<br>Jericho, Chittenden Co.<br>Ripton, Addison Co. </p>\r\n<p>Towns of which WPA inventories listed warning out records, but they now \r\ncannot be found:<br><br>St. George, Chittenden Co.<br>Waltham, Addison \r\nCo.<br>Williston, Chittenden Co. </p>\r\n<p>No warning out records found (and WPA inventory status was not \r\ngiven):<br><br>Averill, Essex Co.<br>Avery's Gore, Essex Co.<br>Brighton, Essex \r\nCo.<br>Canaan, Essex Co.<br>Charleston, Orleans Co.<br>Chester, Windsor Co. \r\n<br>Coventry, Orleans Co.<br>Derby, Orleans Co.<br>East Haven, Essex \r\nCo.<br>Enosburg, Franklin Co.<br>Ferdinand, Essex Co.<br>Fletcher, Franklin \r\nCo.<br>Glastonbury, Bennington Co.<br>Granby, Essex Co.<br>Greensboro, Orleans \r\nCo.

The towns \r\nof Corinth and Dover were previously published but also included in the set. \r\nVermont is fortunate to have all of these records abstracted, published, and \r\nindexed. Otherwise, these valuable records would go unutilized. </p>\r\n<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>\r\n<p>Vermont warnings out cover the periods from 1769 to 1787 and 1801 to 1817. \r\nThe earlier records are sparse and there was no requirement for them to be \r\nrecorded in the town books. Most persons warned out during this time were poor \r\nand transient. The second period contains much more complete records as the town \r\nclerk was required by law to record them. The people warned out in the second \r\nphase were not necessarily poor and most likely did not move out of \r\ntown.<br><br>The value of this class of records is immense. They cover a time in \r\nVermont history where people moved from place to place, expanding the \r\nsettlements into the frontier. These people often did not own land, and the \r\nnumber of vital records fall off dramatically after 1810. A warning out \r\nindicates the person moved into the town in less than twelve months, and \r\nsometimes this is the only clue that a person lived in a town. Researchers \r\nshould be aware that in Vermont, warning out records generally list only the \r\nname of the person, and describe a family group as just \"and family\" or \"and \r\nchildren.\" Anyone searching in this time frame should always consult these \r\nrecords. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Sources and further reading:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Benton, Josiah H., <em>Warning out in New England, 1656-1817</em>(Boston, \r\n1911, reprinted Bowie, Md., 1992).<br>Chaplin, Ann Theopold, \"Rindge Warnings \r\nOut,\" <em>The New Hampshire Genealogical Record</em> , 7 [1990]: \r\n145-153.<br>D'Agostino, Lorenzo, <em>The History of Public Welfare in Vermont \r\n</em>(Washington, D.C., 1948).<br>Lainhart, Ann S., \"Records of the Poor in \r\nPre-Twentieth-Century New England,\" <em>National Genealogical Society \r\nQuarterly</em> , 81: [1993]: 257-269.<br><em>The Laws of the State of \r\nVermont</em> , digested and compiled (Randolph, Vt., 1808, in 2 \r\nvols.).<br>Rollins, Alden M., \"Vermont Warnings Out,\" <em>The New England \r\nHistorical and Genealogical Register</em> , 147 [1993]: 255-260.<br>Rollins, \r\nAlden M., <em>Vermont Warnings Out </em>(Camden, Me., 1995, 1997, in 2 \r\nvols.).<br>Shaw, Helen A., \"Warnings Out in Wardsborough, South District \r\n(Dover), Windham County, Vermont,\" <em>The New England Historical and \r\nGenealogical Register</em> , 149 [1995]: 73-76.<br>Slade, William, <em>The Laws \r\nof Vermont, of a Publick and Permanent Nature coming down to, and including, the \r\nyear 1824</em> (Windsor, Vt., 1825).<br>Slade, William, <em>Vermont State \r\nPapers</em> (Middlebury, Vt., 1823).<br><em>State Papers of Vermont</em> , v. 3, \r\npt. 1, \"Journals and Proceedings of the General Assembly,\" 1778-1781, pt. 8, \r\n1797-1799; v. 12, \"Laws of Vermont, 1777-1780;\" v. 14, \"Laws of Vermont, \r\n1785-1791;\" v. 16, \"Laws of Vermont, 1796-1799.\"<br><em>Worcester County, \r\nMassachusetts, Warnings</em>, 1737-1788 (Worcester, 1899, reprinted Camden, Me., \r\n1992). </p>\r\n</div>", "link": "/web/20121201230949/http://www.americanancestors.org/vermont-warnings-out/", "published": "January 10, 2002", "id": 426}]
